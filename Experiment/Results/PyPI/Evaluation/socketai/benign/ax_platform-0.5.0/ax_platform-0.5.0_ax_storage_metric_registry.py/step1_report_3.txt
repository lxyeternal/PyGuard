{
  "purpose": "Defines functions and registries for handling various Metric classes in a machine learning experiment framework, including registration of custom metrics and encoders/decoders.",
  "sources": "Imports from libraries and modules, class definitions, and function parameters reading metric classes and registries.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code writes data to network, file systems, or external endpoints.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; registration functions process class types and registries without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hashing for registry keys might obscure metric class identification but is standard; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages registry mappings for metrics, including assigning IDs, and registering encoders/decoders. It uses class hashes for default IDs if not provided. The functions do not process user input or external data; they manipulate class objects and internal dictionaries. No signs of code injection, malicious network activity, or malicious logic. No obfuscated code or malware indicators are present. The code appears well-structured and standard for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward registry management module for metrics, encoding, and decoding within a machine learning framework. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It handles internal data structures and class references without external data processing or network activity.",
