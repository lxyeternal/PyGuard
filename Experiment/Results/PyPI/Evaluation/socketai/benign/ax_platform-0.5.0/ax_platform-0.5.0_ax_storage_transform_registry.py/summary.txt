  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and serves as a static registry for transform classes. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) assigned in some reports is justified due to the presence of deprecated entries but does not represent a real vulnerability."
