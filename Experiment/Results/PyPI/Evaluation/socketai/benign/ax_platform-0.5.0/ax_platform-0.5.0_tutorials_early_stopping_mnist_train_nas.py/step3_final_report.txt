{
  "purpose": "A standard MNIST training script utilizing PyTorch Lightning with configurable hyperparameters and dataset path.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for hyperparameters; environment variable 'PATH_DATASETS' for dataset directory.",
  "sinks": "Data flows internally within the training pipeline; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data from dataset loaders to model; no external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured MNIST training pipeline using PyTorch Lightning. It downloads datasets, processes data, trains a neural network, and logs metrics. No external network calls besides dataset download, no obfuscated or malicious code, and standard practices are followed. Environment variables and command-line args are used for configuration, which is normal. No suspicious behaviors or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security issues. It functions as a typical open-source ML training script. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
