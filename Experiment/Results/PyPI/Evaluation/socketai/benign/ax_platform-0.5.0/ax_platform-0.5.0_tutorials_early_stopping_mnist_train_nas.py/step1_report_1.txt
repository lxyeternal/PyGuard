{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to train a neural network model on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch Lightning, with configurable hyperparameters via command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variable PATH_DATASETS and command-line arguments for hyperparameters.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include command-line arguments (for hyperparameters) and environment variables (dataset path). No data is sent over the network or written to disk outside specified paths.",
  "flows": "Hyperparameters from command-line args flow into model initialization and optimizer setup; dataset data flows through DataLoader for training and validation; no external network or data exfiltration detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code employs standard libraries for ML training. No unusual dynamic execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a neural network training pipeline using PyTorch Lightning for MNIST classification. It includes argument parsing, dataset loading, model setup, training, validation, and logging. All components appear standard; hyperparameters are configurable via command-line arguments, and dataset paths are controlled via environment variables. There are no signs of malicious data leaks, hidden network activity, or backdoors. The code adheres to typical training routines and does not contain suspicious logic or data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate ML training script for MNIST classification with no malicious intent or malicious code detected. It is a standard implementation using PyTorch Lightning, with no signs of supply chain attacks or malware.",
