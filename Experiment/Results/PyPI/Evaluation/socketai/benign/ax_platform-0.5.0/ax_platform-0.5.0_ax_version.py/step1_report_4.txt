  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string and tuple to module variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is boilerplate generated by a version control tool; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables based on a static string and tuple. It includes type checking conditional code but does not process any external input or execute dynamic code. The code is standard for package version management and does not perform any suspicious actions or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign boilerplate code generated by setuptools_scm to manage version info. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
