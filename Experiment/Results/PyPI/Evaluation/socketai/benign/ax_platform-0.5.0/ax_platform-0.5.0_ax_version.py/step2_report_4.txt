  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a generated version info module, assigning static version strings and tuples.\n- It uses conditional type hints based on `TYPE_CHECKING`.\n- There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate, standard for package versioning, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard version info for package.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static assignments, no untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: No suspicious patterns; typical auto-generated code.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security risks.\n- **Malware score: 0**, **Obfuscated: 0**, **Risk: 0**\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Analysis: Straightforward static assignments, no external data.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard metadata.\n- **Scores: 0** for malware, obfuscation, risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to above, emphasizing the standard nature of the code.\n- No external input, no dynamic code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores: 0** across the board.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates boilerplate nature, no suspicious patterns.\n- Static version info, no external data.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security risks.\n- **Scores: 0**.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same findings: standard, static version info.\n- No obfuscation, malicious activity, or vulnerabilities.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign code.\n- **Scores: 0**.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Critical Evaluation:\n\n- All reports agree the code is benign, static, auto-generated boilerplate.\n- No external data handling, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0**. The code is straightforward version info, with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**. There is no obfuscation; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0**. No vulnerabilities or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports, I concur that the code is benign.** It is a standard, auto-generated version module with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
