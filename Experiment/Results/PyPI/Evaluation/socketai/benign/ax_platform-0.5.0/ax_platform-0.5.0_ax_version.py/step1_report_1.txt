{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package, generated by setuptools_scm, to be used in version control and package management.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns static string and tuple values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any potentially unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code solely initializes version variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code includes standard versioning logic with conditional typing, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables, with conditional type hints based on TYPE_CHECKING. It assigns static version strings and tuples, with no input or dynamic code execution. The comments clarify that it is auto-generated and should not be modified, which is typical for versioning files. No external data reading, untrusted data handling, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign version information module with no malicious intent or security risks. It only contains static data declarations related to package versioning.",
