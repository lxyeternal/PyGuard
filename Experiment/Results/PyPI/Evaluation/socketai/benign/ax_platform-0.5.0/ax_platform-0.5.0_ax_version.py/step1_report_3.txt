  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment and the conditional import of typing information.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause a data leak or execution effect.",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned directly; no untrusted data flows or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and only assigns static version data. The conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING is standard practice and does not pose malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version information for a package, with conditional typing imports for type hints. It assigns static version data ('0.5.0') and version tuple (0, 5, 0). There are no external inputs, data processing, or external code execution. The structure is typical for auto-generated version files and contains no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated version information module with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
