  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage versioning metadata.",
  "sources": "Constants and variables assigned with static version strings and tuples",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leakage points, no external communication",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignments only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version assignment, no obfuscated code, no secrets or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard versioning metadata file generated by setuptools_scm. It assigns version information to variables with static values. It includes type checking conditionals and no external data inputs or system calls. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present; the code serves purely as metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version metadata code with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
