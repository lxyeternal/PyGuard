  "purpose": "Static version information module generated by setuptools_scm, used for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static version strings and tuples; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potential data leaks; static assignments only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static data assignments are isolated.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated version info snippet with conditional type hints. It contains no external data input, dynamic execution, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these assessments. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard versioning snippet with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
