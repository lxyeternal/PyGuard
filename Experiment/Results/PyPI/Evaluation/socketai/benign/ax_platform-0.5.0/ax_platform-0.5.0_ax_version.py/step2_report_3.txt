  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the details.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as auto-generated by setuptools_scm, used solely for version management.\n- The code assigns static version strings and tuples.\n- No external input, dynamic code execution, or system calls are present.\n- The code includes standard conditional typing support, which is common practice.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n\n**Issue-by-Issue Analysis:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected. The code is straightforward, with no data flows or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard version info code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard auto-generated version info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no external input or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, boilerplate version code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Again, a boilerplate versioning snippet with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No risks.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; standard version assignment code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, static, and auto-generated.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain 0, no security risk.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The code is a standard, benign versioning snippet with no security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified based on the provided analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat.",
