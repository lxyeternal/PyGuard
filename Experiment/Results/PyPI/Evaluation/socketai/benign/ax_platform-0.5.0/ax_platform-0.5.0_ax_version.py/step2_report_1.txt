  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward, static version information module generated by setuptools_scm.\n   - The code contains no external data input, dynamic execution, or any suspicious constructs.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - The assessments of \"no obfuscation,\" \"no malware,\" and \"no security risk\" are justified given the static and boilerplate nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate based on the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Risk Score > 0.5:**\n   - The highest scores are zero across the board, aligning with the benign nature.\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores since there's no indication of malicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they rely on the static, auto-generated nature of the code.\n   - The conclusions are sound.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the static, auto-generated nature of the code, there's no reason to adjust the scores.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns.",
