{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for internal use and version tracking.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; simple version definition with no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code contains static definitions of version variables, with conditional typing support. It explicitly avoids external inputs or dynamic code. The use of TYPE_CHECKING and type annotations is standard for type hints. No obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be boilerplate version info generated by setuptools_scm, which is common in Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version definition snippet with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
