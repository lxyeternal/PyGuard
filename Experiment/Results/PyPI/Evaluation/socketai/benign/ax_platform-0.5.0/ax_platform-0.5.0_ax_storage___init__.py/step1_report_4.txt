  "purpose": "Defines and exports functions for loading and saving JSON data using the ax.storage.json_store module.",
  "sources": "Imports 'load' and 'save' functions from 'ax.storage.json_store'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing identified within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply re-exports imported functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, a license comment, and an __all__ declaration for module exports. It does not contain any input handling, data processing, or network activity. There are no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code behavior, and no evidence of malicious intent. The module appears to serve as a simple interface for JSON storage functions from an external library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and benign, acting as a wrapper or alias for JSON load/save functions. There is no indication of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
