  "purpose": "Expose functions for loading and saving JSON data using the ax.storage.json_store module.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources present; only imports and exports are defined.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only defines and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a third-party module 'ax.storage.json_store' and re-exports them. There are no data inputs, external communications, or code behaviors that could indicate malicious intent. The licensing and copyright notices are standard. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module re-exporting functions for JSON storage. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior.",
