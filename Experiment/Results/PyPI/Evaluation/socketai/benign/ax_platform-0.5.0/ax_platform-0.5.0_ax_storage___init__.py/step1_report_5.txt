{
  "purpose": "This code provides simple import wrappers for JSON load and save functions from a third-party library, likely used for data storage.",
  "sources": "Imports the load and save functions from 'ax.storage.json_store', which may read data from or write data to files.",
  "sinks": "The 'json_load' and 'json_save' functions could potentially be used to process untrusted data, but in this snippet, they are only imported and re-exported; no direct sinks are invoked here.",
  "flows": "The functions could be called elsewhere in the project, passing untrusted data into or out of storage operations, but no flow occurs within this snippet itself.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining imports and exports for JSON storage functions. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no data leaks, or security risks evident here. It simply re-exports functions from an external library. The license comment indicates open-source use, and the module is intended for JSON data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and serves as a simple interface for JSON storage functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation.",
