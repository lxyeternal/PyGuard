  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and only re-exports functions from an external module.\n- No data flows, input/output, or network activity are present within the code snippet.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The purpose across all reports is consistent: providing import aliases or wrappers for JSON load/save functions.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports `load` and `save` from `ax.storage.json_store` and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no sinks, no data flows, and no malicious intent.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n- The malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor point is that, while the code itself is benign, the functions `json_load` and `json_save` could potentially be used elsewhere in the project to process untrusted data. However, since this snippet does not include such usage, the risk remains minimal and is correctly reflected as zero.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- The overall security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues in this code snippet.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code appears to be a benign, simple module serving as an alias or wrapper for JSON storage functions. No further action or concern is warranted based on this analysis.",
