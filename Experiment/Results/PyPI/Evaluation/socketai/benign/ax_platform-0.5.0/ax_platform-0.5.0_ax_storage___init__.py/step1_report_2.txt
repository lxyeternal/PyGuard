  "purpose": "This code provides import wrappers for JSON load and save functions from the 'ax.storage.json_store' module, intended for data serialization and deserialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'ax.storage.json_store' module to import 'load' and 'save' functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "The imported functions 'json_load' and 'json_save' are simply re-exported; no data flow analysis is applicable within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a module and exposes them via __all__. It is straightforward and does not execute or manipulate data itself. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be a standard module setup for serialization functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as an interface for JSON serialization functions, and does not contain malicious or suspicious elements.",
