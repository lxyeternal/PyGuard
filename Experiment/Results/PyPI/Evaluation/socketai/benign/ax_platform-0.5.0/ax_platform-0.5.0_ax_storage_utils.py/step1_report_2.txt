{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for domain types, metric intents, and parameter constraints, and provides a utility function for stable hashing of strings.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (enum, hashlib) and a local module 'ax.core.formatting_utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data, external communications, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The 'stable_hash' function takes a string input and returns a hash value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard patterns. The 'stable_hash' function uses MD5, which is cryptographically weak but not malicious; it’s for consistent hashing, not security.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Enum classes for different categories, which are standard and contain no suspicious values. The 'stable_hash' function computes an MD5 hash of a string and converts it to an integer, intended for consistent hashing across runs. The code appears purely structural and utility-focused, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility component defining enums and a hashing function for internal use. No malicious behavior or security risks are present based on the code provided.",
