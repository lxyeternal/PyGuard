  "purpose": "Provides enum definitions for domain types, metric intents, parameter constraints, and a utility function for consistent string hashing using MD5.",
  "sources": "None; the code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks exists.",
  "anomalies": "Use of MD5 for hashing, which is cryptographically weak but acceptable for non-security purposes; no obfuscation or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum class definitions and a simple hashing function. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The use of MD5 is noted but is for consistent hashing, not security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to MD5's cryptographic weaknesses. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of anomalies or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module defining enums and a consistent hashing function. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The existing assessment scores are appropriate; a minimal risk score of 0.1 is justified due to MD5's cryptographic weaknesses but does not indicate malicious intent.",
