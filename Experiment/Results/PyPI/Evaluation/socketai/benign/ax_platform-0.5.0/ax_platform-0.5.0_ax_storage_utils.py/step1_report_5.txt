{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for domain types, metric intents, and parameter constraint types, along with a utility function for generating a stable hash of a string.",
  "sources": "Imports from hashlib for hashing, and imports enum for enumeration classes.",
  "sinks": "The only functional sink is the 'stable_hash' function which computes an MD5 hash and converts it to an integer.",
  "flows": "Input strings to the 'stable_hash' function flow through md5 hashing, resulting in an integer hash.",
  "anomalies": "The 'stable_hash' function uses MD5, which is cryptographically insecure but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. No external data sources or sinks are found.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it defines enums for various purposes and a utility function for hashing strings. The hashing function uses md5, which is not recommended for security-critical applications but is not malicious. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are detected. There is no evidence of malware or obfuscation; the code is clean and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It provides enumerations and a simple hashing utility without any suspicious behavior.",
