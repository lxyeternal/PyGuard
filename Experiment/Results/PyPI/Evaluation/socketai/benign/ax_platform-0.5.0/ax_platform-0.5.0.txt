      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module defining enums and a consistent hashing function. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The existing assessment scores are appropriate; a minimal risk score of 0.1 is justified due to MD5's cryptographic weaknesses but does not indicate malicious intent."
