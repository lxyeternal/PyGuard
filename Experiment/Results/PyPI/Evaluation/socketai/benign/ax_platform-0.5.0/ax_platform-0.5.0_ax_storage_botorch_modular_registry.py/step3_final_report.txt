{
  "purpose": "The code manages class registries for various ML components, enabling dynamic registration and lookup of classes by type and name.",
  "sources": "Import statements for ML models, kernels, likelihoods, and registration dictionaries; registration functions adding classes to registries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or data leaks; static mappings and registration functions only.",
  "flows": "Registration functions update registry dictionaries with class-to-string and string-to-class mappings; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward registry management without obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for class registration and mapping in a plugin-like system for ML components. It imports relevant classes, defines dictionaries for class-to-string and string-to-class mappings, and provides registration functions. No network activity, data leaks, code injection, or obfuscated constructs are present. The registration of 'SEBOAcquisition' is benign and typical for extensibility. The code is static, transparent, and intended for modularity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard registry setup for ML components with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe, intended behavior.",
