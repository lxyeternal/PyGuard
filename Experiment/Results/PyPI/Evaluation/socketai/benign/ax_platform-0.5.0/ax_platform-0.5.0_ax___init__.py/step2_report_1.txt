  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely import/export boilerplate with no active logic. The try-except with 'pass' and setting `__version__` to 'Unknown' is benign, possibly a placeholder.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to the unusual try-except pattern, but not harmful.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code only imports and defines an `__all__` list. The try-except block is again a benign placeholder.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — same as above.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—imports, `__all__`, and a trivial try-except. No dynamic code, no data handling, no network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, static imports, no data flow, no suspicious logic. The try-except is harmless.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No changes.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above—simple import/export setup with a redundant try-except block.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Verdict:** Valid. No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with a score of 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) due to the unusual try-except pattern, but this is benign and appears as a placeholder or minimal fallback. I would suggest a **risk score of 0.1** is appropriate, matching the reports.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only unusual element—the try-except block—is benign and does not elevate security concerns.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign module primarily importing and exposing components from the 'ax' library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments provided.",
