{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports various components from the 'ax' library and exposes them via the __all__ list, effectively creating an interface or facade for these components.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and defines the __all__ list; no external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process external input or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual element is a try-except block with a pass statement and setting __version__ to 'Unknown' in case of an exception, which appears to be a benign placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup module that imports components from the 'ax' library and exposes them via __all__. The try-except block is harmless and likely intended as a fallback. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only anomaly is a trivial try-except block, which is harmless. Overall, the code is a standard setup module for the 'ax' library.",
