  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is primarily a set of import statements from the 'ax' library, with an '__all__' list for exports.\n- The only unusual element across reports is a trivial try-except block with a 'pass' statement and setting `__version__ = \"Unknown\"` in case of an exception.\n- No reports identify any dynamic code execution, handling of untrusted data, network operations, or other suspicious behavior.\n- All reports assign very low security risk scores (around 0.1), with some even zero, indicating negligible concern.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, with no claims of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code behavior:** The code is a straightforward module that imports components from the 'ax' library and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None identified; the code does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n\n### Flaws or logical mistakes:\n- The only \"anomaly\" is the `try-except` block with only a `pass`, which is likely a placeholder or minimal fallback. This pattern is benign but somewhat unusual.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any activity that warrants a high risk score.\n- The code is purely static, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The minor unusual pattern (try-except with pass) does not justify a higher risk score.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, benign setup code)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The overall code is a benign module designed to expose components from the 'ax' library.\n- The only \"suspicious\" element is the placeholder try-except block, which is harmless.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain report correctly identifies the code as benign with no malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no further escalation is necessary. The code does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond trivial and harmless patterns.",
