{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module importing various components from the 'ax' library, likely used for Bayesian optimization or experiment management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'ax' library modules, and a try-except block that assigns a version string.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external system calls. The code does not perform network, file, or system operations.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules and defines an exception handling block, with no data flow or execution logic involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an empty try-except block that assigns a version string; no real operation occurs here. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports multiple components from the 'ax' library, likely for optimization purposes. The try-except block with 'pass' and a version assignment is redundant and does not perform any meaningful operation or data handling. The __all__ list exposes the imported symbols for external use. Overall, the code is a straightforward module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no sources or sinks involving untrusted data, and no suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module import and export setup for the 'ax' optimization library. It does not contain malware, malicious code, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the redundant try-except block, which does not impact security.",
