{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface and documentation for the managedblockchain-query service client and paginators, facilitating interaction with AWS managed blockchain queries.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from local package files (.client and .paginator). No external or untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present that process untrusted data; the code primarily sets up class and function references.",
  "flows": "The code does not process untrusted data or user inputs; it mainly defines and exports classes and variables for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements detected. The copyright date is in the future, but that alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and functions from local modules and defines a client alias and __all__ for exports. It contains documentation with example usage. There are no functions, data processing, or input handling that could be exploited. The content appears to be a straightforward module setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup module providing interface definitions and documentation for a managed blockchain query client. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident.",
