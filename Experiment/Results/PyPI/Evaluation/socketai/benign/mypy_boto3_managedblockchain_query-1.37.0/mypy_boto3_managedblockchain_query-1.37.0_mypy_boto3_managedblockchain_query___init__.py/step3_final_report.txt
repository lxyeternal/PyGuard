{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python module that provides an interface for the managedblockchain-query service, importing relevant classes and functions, setting up an alias, and defining exports for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client and .paginator), static docstring, hardcoded strings, and identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network activity, or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; the code only sets up class references and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The module is a straightforward setup for an SDK interface, importing classes and functions, defining an alias, and exporting them. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, network calls, or secrets. The code is static, well-structured, and serves purely as an interface layer. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely as a structural interface for the managedblockchain-query SDK components. The minor anomaly regarding the copyright year is likely a typo and does not influence security.",
