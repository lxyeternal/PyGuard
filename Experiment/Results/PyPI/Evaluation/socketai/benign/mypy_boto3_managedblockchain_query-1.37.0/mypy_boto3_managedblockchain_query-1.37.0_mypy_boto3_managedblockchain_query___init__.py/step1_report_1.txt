{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the managedblockchain-query service by importing and aliasing classes and functions from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Reads module imports, documentation string, and hardcoded string identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or written; no external data output or system modification occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly sets up imports and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a detailed docstring with example usage, but no suspicious code or secrets; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and functions from internal files and re-exports them. The docstring provides usage instructions and documentation links. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious logic. It does not handle any external input, perform network operations, or manipulate system resources. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an interface wrapper for the managedblockchain-query client with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module providing API access to other components.",
