{
  "purpose": "Provide an interface and documentation for the managedblockchain-query service client and its paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), module-level string documentation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or external data sources present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports classes and defines an alias, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The documentation contains a copyright date of 2025, which is in the future relative to current known dates; this might be a typo or an inconsistency but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules and defines an alias for the client class. It contains only documentation and import statements without any dynamic code execution, input handling, or data processing. The code structure is straightforward and standard for a Python package interface. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code behavior, and no external data processing are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module providing interface definitions and documentation for a managed blockchain query client. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
