{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface and imports for the managedblockchain-query service client and its paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client and .paginator), and embedded documentation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process user input or external data directly.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code primarily defines imports and documentation without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code contains standard import statements, documentation, and simple assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports client and paginator classes, sets a Client alias, and defines __all__ for exports. It includes a descriptive docstring with usage instructions and licensing information. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a module interface. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or malicious behavior indicators are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface for a Python SDK component. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It is safe for use.",
