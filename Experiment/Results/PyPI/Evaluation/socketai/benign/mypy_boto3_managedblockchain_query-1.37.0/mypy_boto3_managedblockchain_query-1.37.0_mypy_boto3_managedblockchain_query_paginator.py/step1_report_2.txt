{
  "purpose": "Define paginators for the managedblockchain-query service client, providing type-safe interfaces for pagination in boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and botocore.paginate; type definitions from local module; dynamic class inheritance and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs that are unpacked into specific type definitions; no external or untrusted data sources are directly processed.",
  "flows": "User calls the paginate method with parameters, which are unpacked and passed to the underlying Paginator's paginate method, returning a PageIterator.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional imports for type checking and version-specific imports, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected. The class structure is standard for boto3-stubs pagination wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, type-annotated wrapper for boto3 pagination classes, enhancing type safety and documentation. No external data sources or network calls are evident in this module. It defines subclasses that override the paginate method, which simply delegates to the underlying Paginator. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or code injection. The code appears purely as a helper for type-safe API interaction. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. All imports and definitions are consistent with standard boto3-stubs practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of paginator wrappers for boto3, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely provides type annotations and method wrappers to facilitate safer use of boto3 paginators.",
