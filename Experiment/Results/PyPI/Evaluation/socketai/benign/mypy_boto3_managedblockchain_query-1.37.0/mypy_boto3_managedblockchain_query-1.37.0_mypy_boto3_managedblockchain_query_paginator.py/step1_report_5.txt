{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for the 'managedblockchain-query' service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API responses with static type hints.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from imported modules and environment, and it uses the 'client.get_paginator' method to retrieve paginator instances.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs, which are unpacked into type definitions; no external untrusted data sources are directly processed within the code.",
  "flows": "Input (kwargs) → paginate method → PageIterator, with no external or untrusted data processed directly; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; the code appears to be straightforward type annotation and class extension for boto3 pagination; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with proper type annotations, extending from the 'Paginator' class, and provides a 'paginate' method for each, with documentation links. The code imports type definitions and uses conditional imports for compatibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscated code. All operations are typical for SDK wrapper classes. No external inputs or outputs suggest malicious intent; the focus is solely on static typing and class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured SDK helper module for boto3, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as a static type hinting and class wrapper layer for paginated API calls, with no external or untrusted data processing.",
