{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator classes for the managedblockchain-query service client, facilitating paginated API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads class and function definitions, imports, and type annotations. It also imports data types and reads version info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or process untrusted data directly; it only defines class methods and imports. No sinks that handle untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "The class methods 'paginate' accept keyword arguments of specific types and return PageIterator objects; no untrusted data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for paginators with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with 'paginate' methods, incorporating type annotations for input and output types. It uses conditional imports based on Python version and employs TYPE_CHECKING for type hints. All classes and methods are standard, with documentation links. No external or runtime data handling or code execution is present. No indicators of obfuscated, malicious, or maliciously obfuscated code. The code appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate for SDK type stubs, with no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, type-annotated SDK stub implementation for paginators in the boto3 managedblockchain-query client. It contains no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
