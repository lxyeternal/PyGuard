  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class wrappers for boto3's managedblockchain-query service client, intended to provide type safety and structured access to paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Class methods 'paginate' accepting **kwargs for pagination parameters, which are passed to underlying boto3 paginator methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; the code is static and only defines classes and methods.",
  "flows": "Input parameters via **kwargs flow into boto3 paginator methods; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static implementation of boto3 paginator wrappers with type annotations, serving as a type-safe interface. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The use of **kwargs is standard for boto3 pagination, with minimal risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign, boilerplate nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified given its static, SDK wrapper purpose. No modifications are necessary; the scores accurately reflect the code's security profile.",
