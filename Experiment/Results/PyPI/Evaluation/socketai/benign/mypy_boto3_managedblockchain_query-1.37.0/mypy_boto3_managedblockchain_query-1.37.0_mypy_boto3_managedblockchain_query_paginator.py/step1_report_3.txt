  "purpose": "Define paginator classes for managedblockchain-query service client with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Code imports, class definitions, and method implementations, especially the 'paginate' methods accepting **kwargs with specific types.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods utilize untrusted **kwargs, which could, in theory, influence the pagination behavior if misused, but no direct sinks for malicious code execution or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Input flows from the 'kwargs' in 'paginate' methods to the underlying Paginator class, which processes pagination parameters; no external data flow or untrusted sources evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard type annotations and class inheritance for boto3 paginator wrappers. No unusual variable names or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type-safe paginator classes with methods that accept flexible parameters via **kwargs. These parameters are unpacked and passed to the underlying Paginator. The structure is typical for boto3 stubs, with conditional imports for type checking and version compatibility. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling is observed. The code primarily serves as a type annotation layer with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for boto3, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed for type safety and documentation purposes. No malware, backdoors, or security issues are evident.",
