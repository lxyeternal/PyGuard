{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator classes for the managedblockchain-query service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, sys.version_info, and function parameters with **kwargs for pagination.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data into vulnerable operations; no network, file, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Input data from **kwargs flows through the paginate methods, but these are standard paginator calls without untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code strictly defines paginator classes with no dynamic code execution or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of boto3 paginator classes with type annotations, including conditional imports for type checking, and no execution of untrusted data. It mainly wraps existing boto3 paginator behavior with added type safety via type annotations. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are present, and the code adheres to typical patterns for boto3 stubs. No network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are implemented. Overall, the code appears to be a benign, type-safe interface for AWS SDK pagination.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type annotation and wrapper implementation for boto3 paginators. No malicious intent or security risks are identified. It serves purely as a type-safe interface with no evident malware or security threats.",
