  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the provided code to identify any security concerns, anomalies, or inconsistencies.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is solely composed of Python type annotations, TypedDict definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation comments.\n- No executable logic, network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution exists.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The conditional imports based on `sys.version_info` are standard practice for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.\n- The code appears to be part of an SDK or type definition module, meant to facilitate static type checking and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n\n- **Presence of malicious or suspicious code:** None. All reports agree that the code is purely structural, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None. The code does not process untrusted data at runtime, nor does it contain any executable functions or logic that could be exploited.\n- **Use of secrets or obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Data flow concerns:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines data structures.\n- **Compatibility handling:** Standard conditional imports for Python version compatibility, not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n- **Reports 1-5:** All conclude that the code is safe, standard, and intended for static type annotations. No malicious activity or security risks are identified.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign `0` or very low, which aligns with the code's nature as a type definition module.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjusting scores:** Given the comprehensive analysis, the scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Potential for higher risk scores:** Not applicable, as there's no executable or data handling logic.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and data schemas for a blockchain SDK, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.**\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, with no supply chain security issues.**",
