  "sources": "Type annotations, TypedDict classes, conditional imports for compatibility, documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no runtime data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Static type definitions serve as schemas; no data flow at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type definitions with standard compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static type annotations and data schemas for a Python SDK, with conditional imports for cross-version compatibility. It contains no executable logic, network calls, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely structural, facilitating static analysis and documentation. No data flows from untrusted sources, and there are no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of type definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It poses negligible supply chain security risk.",
