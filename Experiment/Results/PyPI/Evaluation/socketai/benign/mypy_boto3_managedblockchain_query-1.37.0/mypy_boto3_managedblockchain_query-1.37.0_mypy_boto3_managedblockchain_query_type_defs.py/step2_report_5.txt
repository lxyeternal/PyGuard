  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- **Reports 1-5:** All describe the code as solely defining type annotations, data schemas, and conditional imports for compatibility. They emphasize that there is no executable logic, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code that could be exploited or malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified. They consistently conclude the code is safe, intended for static analysis, and poses no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is purely type definitions; no executable code, data handling, or dynamic behavior. Therefore, issues like vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious code are inherently absent.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** No logical errors or mistakes are evident. The code follows standard patterns for defining TypedDicts and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Scores and reasoning:**\n  - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n  - **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, transparent nature of the code.\n  - **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low, which is appropriate given the context.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Data flow and untrusted input:** While some input parameters are marked as `NotRequired`, these are just type annotations for static checking. There are no runtime functions or logic that process untrusted data.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code does not process data; it only defines data structures. No signs of injection, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Use of conditional imports:** Standard practice for compatibility; no security concern.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no operational code, no external data handling, no vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a set of static type definitions and data schemas for a Python SDK interacting with a blockchain service. It contains no executable logic, network operations, or data processing that could be exploited. The use of conditional imports is standard for cross-version compatibility. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n**Therefore, I agree with the assessments in the reports: the code is safe, clean, and free of security risks.**\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's nature as purely static type annotations with no operational or executable components.",
