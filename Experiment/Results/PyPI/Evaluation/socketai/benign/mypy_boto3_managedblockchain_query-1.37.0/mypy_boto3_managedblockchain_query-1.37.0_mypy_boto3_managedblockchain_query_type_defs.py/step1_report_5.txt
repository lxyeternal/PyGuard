  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for managed blockchain query services in Python, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, type annotations, and class definitions including data structures like TypedDict, Union, and Literal.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code primarily defines data types and schemas without executing or processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve static type annotations used for validation and documentation, not runtime data handling or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code appears solely as type and data schema definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of type definitions using Python's typing and TypedDict modules, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. It defines numerous data schemas related to blockchain transactions, tokens, and network metadata. No functions, runtime logic, network calls, or data processing present. No input handling, external data sources, or sink functions that could be exploited. The structure is consistent with type declaration files meant for static analysis and IDE support. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a collection of type definitions intended for static type checking and documentation purposes in a blockchain query library. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or runtime operations. Consequently, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
