  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- **Reports 1-5:** All conclude that the code is purely a set of type annotations and data structure definitions for a blockchain SDK. They note the absence of executable logic, data processing, network calls, or any malicious code. The use of conditional imports for Python version compatibility is standard practice. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or signs of malware are identified. The confidence level is high (1), and all report that the malware, obfuscated code, and security risks are zero.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step evaluation:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or malware:**\n   - No executable code, network calls, or dynamic data handling.\n   - No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets.\n   - The code is purely declarative, defining types for static analysis and documentation.\n\n2. **Logical flaws or mistakes:**\n   - The code appears well-structured, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n   - All type annotations seem consistent with their intended use.\n   - No logical errors or risky constructs are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`. These are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The `risk` score is also 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is only type definitions, with no runtime or data processing.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are made, and none are justified.\n\n5. **Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n   - The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### My expert estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed reviews and the nature of the code, I concur with the assessments. The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK, with no malicious or risky elements.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider that type definition files, especially those with no executable logic, inherently pose minimal security risk. The comprehensive review confirms this.",
