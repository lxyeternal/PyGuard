{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for managed blockchain query services, intended to facilitate static type checking and validation in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys module for version checks, standard library modules (datetime, typing), and local module literals.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data processing; the code primarily defines data structures.",
  "flows": "Data structures are defined for input/output types but do not include executable flows or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. Use of version-dependent imports appears standard. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of TypedDict class definitions, type annotations, and conditional imports for compatibility. No code execution, network operations, or data handling logic is present that could be exploited. The use of standard Python typing and conditional imports appears benign. No signs of malware, data leaks, or security issues are evident. The code serves purely as type definitions and documentation references.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only type annotations and data structure definitions for a blockchain query service API. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities present. It appears to be a well-structured, standard type definition module with no indicators of supply chain compromise.",
