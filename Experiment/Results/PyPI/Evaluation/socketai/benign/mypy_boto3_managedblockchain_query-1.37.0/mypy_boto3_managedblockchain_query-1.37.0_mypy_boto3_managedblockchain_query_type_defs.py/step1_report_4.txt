  "purpose": "Type definitions for managedblockchain-query service for use in Python code with type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads constants, type annotations, and imported modules. It does not read external input or data sources dynamically at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data directly; the code mainly defines data structures and type annotations.",
  "flows": "There are no executable flows or data processing pipelines; the code only declares types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly defines type annotations and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive set of TypedDict definitions for a managed blockchain query SDK, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no dynamic executions, obfuscated elements, or suspicious code behaviors. It does not perform any I/O, network, or file operations, nor does it contain code that could be exploited for malicious purposes. The structure and content appear to be standard type definitions for a typed interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type definitions for a Python SDK. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code fragment.",
