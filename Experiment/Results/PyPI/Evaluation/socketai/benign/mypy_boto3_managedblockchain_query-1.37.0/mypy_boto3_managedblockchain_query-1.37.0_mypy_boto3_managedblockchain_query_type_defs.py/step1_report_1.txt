  "purpose": "Type definitions for managedblockchain-query service, providing structured data models and type annotations for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (__future__, sys, datetime, typing, typing_extensions, and local literals).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; code mainly defines data structures without executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code defines types only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. Usage of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of type annotations, class definitions (TypedDict), and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No data processing, input handling, or dynamic execution is present. There are no network calls, credential handling, or code that could be exploited or used maliciously. The structure is typical for SDK type definitions, with no signs of hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely for type annotations and data structure definitions. It does not contain executable logic, external data handling, or potential vectors for malicious activity. It appears safe and intended for use as part of a larger SDK. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
