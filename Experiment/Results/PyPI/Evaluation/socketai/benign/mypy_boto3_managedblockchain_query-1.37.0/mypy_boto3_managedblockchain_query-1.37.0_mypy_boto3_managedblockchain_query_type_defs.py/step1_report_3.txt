  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for managed blockchain query service API.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definitions, and data structure declarations within the module.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data inputs include input parameters in the TypedDict definitions, especially those marked as NotRequired, and input parameters in function signatures (if any).",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs into function parameters, then through TypedDict fields, with no evidence of data being processed or transmitted elsewhere within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is primarily type definitions and does not include executable logic, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. No obfuscation or code injection mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of static type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and import statements. All data structures serve to specify the shape of data exchanged with the managed blockchain service. No executable code, network calls, or data processing logic are present that could be exploited. The import statements and conditional type imports are standard for compatibility and do not suggest malicious intent. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious import patterns are evident. The lack of executable logic means the code itself cannot perform malicious actions. The definitions are straightforward and intended for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "This module is solely composed of type definitions for API data structures, with no executable or network code that could be malicious. It appears safe and purely structural, serving as a contract for data exchange. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is detected.",
