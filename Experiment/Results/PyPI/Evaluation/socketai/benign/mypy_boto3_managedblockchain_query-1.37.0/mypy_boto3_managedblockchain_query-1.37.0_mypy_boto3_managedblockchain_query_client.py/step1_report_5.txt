{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the managedblockchain-query AWS service, providing a typed interface for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party packages (botocore, sys), and local modules (paginator, type_defs). No input or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no functions execute untrusted data, write to external systems, or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines type annotations and class structures without data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and consists of type annotations and class/interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains type annotations, class definitions, and property/method signatures for a boto3 client wrapper, including overloaded methods for pagination. It imports necessary modules and defines exception classes. There are no runtime code executions, data processing, or dynamic code evaluations. The structure aligns with standard SDK interface definitions and documentation linking, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK wrapper for the AWS managedblockchain-query service, intended for type safety and better developer experience. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
