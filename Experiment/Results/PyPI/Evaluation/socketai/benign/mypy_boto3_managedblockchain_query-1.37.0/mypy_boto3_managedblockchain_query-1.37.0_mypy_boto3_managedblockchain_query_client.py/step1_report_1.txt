{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for interacting with the ManagedBlockchain Query service using boto3, including method signatures and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, third-party packages (botocore, typing_extensions), and local type definition modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network calls or file operations are present; methods are placeholders with signatures, no actual execution logic.",
  "flows": "Method signatures indicate data flow from input parameters (**kwargs) to return types, but no runtime code or data processing is included.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code appears to be a straightforward interface definition with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python client interface for AWS boto3 service, with extensive use of type annotations, overloading, and property/method signatures. It strictly defines method signatures and expected return types, with no actual implementation or logic. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are observed. It appears to be a standard, well-structured stub for AWS SDK interaction, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK interface stub for AWS ManagedBlockchain Query service with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as a type-annotated interface for SDK usage, not executing any sensitive or harmful actions.",
