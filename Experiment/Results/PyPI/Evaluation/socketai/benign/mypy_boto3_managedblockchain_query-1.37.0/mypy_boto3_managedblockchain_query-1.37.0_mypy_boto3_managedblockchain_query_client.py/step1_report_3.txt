  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the managedblockchain-query AWS service in boto3-stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; method definitions; type annotations; property accessors.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no code executes untrusted input or external data transformations.",
  "flows": "N/A — primarily type definitions and method signatures; no data processing flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for AWS managed blockchain query service with appropriate type annotations, method signatures, and overloads for paginators. It imports necessary modules, sets up exception types, and provides method documentation links. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured interface definition for SDK type safety, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward SDK interface with no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely provides type annotations and method signatures for the AWS client. There are no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
