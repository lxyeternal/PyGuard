  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check for potential issues, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and client class for boto3 ManagedBlockchain Query service; sources are standard libraries, botocore, and local type modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or runtime logic; methods are placeholders with signatures.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK stub, purely interface with no executable logic, no malware or security issues.\n\n**Assessment:** Completely benign, no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; standard library, botocore, local modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data output; methods are signatures only.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard type annotations for SDK, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, standard SDK stub. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; no runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data manipulation or network calls within this code.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK interface, purely for type safety.\n\n**Assessment:** No malware or security issues. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK client interface; includes API URL generation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Method signatures suggest potential URL generation and API calls, but no actual execution or data handling code.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK client with type annotations; no malicious intent.\n\n**Note:** The report mentions \"securityRisk\": 0.2, which is slightly elevated but not high. This likely reflects the fact that methods like `generate_presigned_url` involve URL generation, which could be misused if the code were malicious, but here it’s just a stub.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malware; the slight security risk score probably accounts for URL generation capability, but in this context, it’s benign. Confidence: 0.9.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; no runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK interface, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Benign, no malware or obfuscation. Confidence: 1.0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking for Malicious Indicators:\n- **Hardcoded secrets:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code.\n- **Malicious logic:** No code execution, network calls, or data leaks.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** The code is purely interface/type annotations, typical for SDK stubs.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware:** All reports consistently show no malware. The slight security risk in report 4 is justified by the URL generation method, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** Zero in all reports.\n- **Risk:** Given the absence of actual logic or data handling, the overall risk remains very low, close to 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n**Malware score:** **0.0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0.0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (accounting for URL generation capabilities, but no actual threat)  \n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface stub with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight risk score in report 4 is justified by the nature of URL presigning but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports confirm that this code is a benign, standard AWS SDK interface stub with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The overall assessment aligns with a very low risk profile, primarily due to the presence of URL generation capabilities, which are common in SDK clients but not inherently malicious.",
