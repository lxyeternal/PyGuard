  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and client class for boto3, no suspicious imports or data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or runtime logic; purely interface definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK stub, straightforward, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type safety and interface for AWS SDK.\n- No suspicious patterns, no runtime logic, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on type annotations and method signatures for the AWS client.\n- No dynamic code, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) and malware score (0), but based on the description, the code is mainly interface definitions.\n- It mentions potential data transmission via URLs and API parameters, which is standard for SDK clients.\n- No actual data processing or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — perhaps slightly conservative but still reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous reports, standard SDK interface code.\n- No suspicious patterns or runtime logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports describe code that is purely type annotations and interface definitions for AWS SDK clients.\n- **Malware:** None of the reports indicate any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.\n- **Security risk:** The only slight concern is the minimal risk score in Report 4 (0.2), but given the nature of the code, this is overly cautious and not justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0** across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Should be **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, should be **0** for all reports.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface stub for AWS ManagedBlockchain Query service, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reported scores are generally appropriate but could be uniformly lowered to zero for malware and obfuscation, and the risk score should be zero as well.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code as SDK interface definitions.",
