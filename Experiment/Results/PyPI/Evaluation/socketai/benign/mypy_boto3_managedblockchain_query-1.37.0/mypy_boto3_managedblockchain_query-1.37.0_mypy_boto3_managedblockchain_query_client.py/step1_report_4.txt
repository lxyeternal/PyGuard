{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for managing interactions with AWS Managed Blockchain Query service, facilitating typed API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, third-party botocore modules, and local type definitions. Code uses input parameters in method signatures, especially **kwargs with type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Generated URLs, API request parameters, and method calls that could potentially transmit data. No direct data sinks for user input or external data flow evident, beyond standard API operations.",
  "flows": "Method calls with unpacked input types leading to API interactions, such as generate_presigned_url or specific get/list operations, which invoke AWS endpoints with provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code consists of standard API client definitions and type annotations. No dynamic code execution or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a typed client class for AWS Managed Blockchain Query with method signatures, type annotations, and overloads for paginators. It uses type hints, including Unpack for input types, and references to external AWS documentation. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The code structure is consistent with SDK client wrappers and is purely for API interfacing and type safety.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign API client interface with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured for type safety and documentation, with no anomalies indicating malicious behavior or backdoors.",
