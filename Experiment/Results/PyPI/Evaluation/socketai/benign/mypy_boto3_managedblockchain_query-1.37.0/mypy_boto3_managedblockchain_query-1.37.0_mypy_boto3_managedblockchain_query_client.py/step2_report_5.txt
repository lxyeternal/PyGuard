No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and interface for boto3-stubs.  \n- **Sources:** Imports of standard, botocore, and local modules.  \n- **Sinks:** No external or untrusted data output.  \n- **Flows:** Input unpacking, no malicious data flow.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis:** Typical SDK stub, no internal logic or external calls.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Clear, consistent, benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and client interface.  \n- **Sources:** Imports, method signatures, type annotations.  \n- **Sinks:** No untrusted data or external execution.  \n- **Flows:** Mainly type definitions; no data processing.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard SDK interface, purely type hints and method signatures.  \n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious activity.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent, safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and API client for AWS Managed Blockchain Query.  \n- **Sources:** Imports, method signatures, type hints.  \n- **Sinks:** API request parameters and URLs, but these are standard for SDK wrappers.  \n- **Flows:** Data flows through method calls, typical for SDK interfaces.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard, well-structured SDK client interface; no malicious logic.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware or security risks.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (slightly less, but still high)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (slightly elevated but justified as standard API interaction)\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated security risk score (0.2) due to API URL generation, but this is typical and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and SDK interface.  \n- **Sources:** Imports, class/method signatures.  \n- **Sinks:** No untrusted data or external execution.  \n- **Flows:** No data processing, only type definitions.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard SDK interface; no malicious logic.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malware.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Estimation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate only interface/type stub code, with no runtime logic, network calls, or data manipulation. No signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation. **Estimated malware score: 0.0**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution. **Estimated obfuscated score: 0.0**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The code is a standard SDK interface, primarily for type safety and documentation. The only slight elevation is in report 4, where a small security risk score (0.2) is justified by the nature of URL generation, which is typical for SDK clients. Overall, the risk remains minimal. **Estimated risk score: 0.0 to 0.2**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification**\n\n- All reports describe code that is purely interface/stub code for AWS SDK interactions.\n- No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present.\n- The slight security risk score in report 4 is justified by the API URL generation, which is standard and not malicious.\n- The malware score is consistently zero, reflecting the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Therefore, my final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (a conservative, minimal risk due to API URL generation, but still negligible)\n\nThis code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface stub with no signs of security issues.",
