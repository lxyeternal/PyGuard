  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for AWS ManagedBlockchain Query SDK interface.",
  "sources": "Standard libraries, botocore modules, local type definition modules.",
  "sinks": "Method signatures for API calls, URL generation functions, no data output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters unpacked into method calls; no runtime logic or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK stub providing type annotations and method signatures for the ManagedBlockchain Query client. It contains no executable logic, data leaks, or malicious patterns. The presence of URL generation functions is typical for SDK clients and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure and imports are consistent with benign SDK interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface stub with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security risk score observed in some reports is justified by the nature of URL presigning but does not reflect any malicious activity.",
