  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It reads `sys.argv` for input, writes to `sys.stdout`, and has no dynamic data sources, network calls, or sensitive operations.\n- There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The functions `print_info()` and `print_version()` only output predefined static strings.\n- The logic is straightforward and standard for CLI tools.\n\n**2. Report Analysis:**\n\n- All five reports consistently describe the script as benign, straightforward, and static.\n- They confirm the absence of malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- They note that the script only processes a simple command-line argument (`--version`) and outputs static text.\n- The confidence level is 1 across all reports, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, or vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n**3. Scores Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, non-malicious nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**4. Justification for Scores:**\n\n- Since the code is purely informational, with no dynamic or malicious elements, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n- No changes needed here.\n\n**5. Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are consistent with the code.\n\n**6. Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n\n- All reports correctly state that no suspicious or malicious behavior is present.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on static code review.\n\n**7. Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign CLI utility.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores reflect the true nature of the code.\n\n**8. Final Recommendations:**\n\n- Based on the code and reports, the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Score |\n|------------------|-------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, static CLI utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No security risks are present.",
