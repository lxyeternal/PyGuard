  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 ManagedBlockchainQuery, including version and documentation details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output messages",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for output, sys.argv for input parameters",
  "flows": "User input in sys.argv influences whether print_version() or print_info() is called, which then outputs static package info",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. All data printed is static and informational.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print static package information and version, and executes main() if run directly. It processes command-line argument '--version' to conditionally print version info. The outputs are static strings with no dynamic or untrusted data sources. No signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious activities. The code structure and content appear standard for a CLI utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script that outputs package information and version details. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
