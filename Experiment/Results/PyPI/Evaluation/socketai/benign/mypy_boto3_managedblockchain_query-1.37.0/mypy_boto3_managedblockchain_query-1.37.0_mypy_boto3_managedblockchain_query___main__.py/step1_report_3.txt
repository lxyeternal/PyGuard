  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output display",
  "flows": "Input argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() is called, outputting package info",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code simply outputs static strings",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details. It reads command-line arguments to determine behavior, which is standard. No untrusted input is processed beyond the presence of '--version'. Output is limited to predefined static text, with no dynamic or external data involved. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script intended to display package metadata. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks.",
