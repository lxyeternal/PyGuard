  "purpose": "Provide a static CLI utility that outputs package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument '--version' in sys.argv",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write() for output",
  "flows": "sys.argv input -> main() decision -> print_info() or print_version() -> sys.stdout.write()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static strings, no dynamic code, no credentials, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static package info or version. It reads a simple argument, performs no dynamic or network operations, and contains only static strings. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The functions are minimal, and the logic is clear and safe. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
