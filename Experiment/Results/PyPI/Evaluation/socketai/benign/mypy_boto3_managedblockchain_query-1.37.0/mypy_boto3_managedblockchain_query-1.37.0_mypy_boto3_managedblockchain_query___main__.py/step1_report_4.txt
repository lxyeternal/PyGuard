  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing information about boto3 ManagedBlockchainQuery stubs and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",

  "flows": "Command-line argument check from sys.argv leading to version output, otherwise printing package info to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script provides basic CLI functionality: printing package info or version based on arguments. It uses standard Python sys modules for input/output, with no external data sources or untrusted inputs processed. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple CLI tool to display package information. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
