  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses `sys.argv` for input and `sys.stdout.write()` for output.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, no network calls, no external data sources, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n   - The functions are simple, and the script's purpose is purely informational.\n\n2. **Report Summaries and Logic:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, static, and free of malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n   - They consistently note the absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, dynamic code, obfuscation, or network activity.\n   - The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are aligned with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the script.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The code does not process untrusted input beyond a simple argument check, which is safe.\n   - No reason to adjust the scores or conclusions.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility serving informational purposes.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n- The code poses no security concern.\n- The analysis confirms the benign nature of this script.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's characteristics.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
