  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details.\n   - It reads command-line arguments via `sys.argv` and writes output to `sys.stdout`.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, no external data sources, no network calls, no credentials, and no obfuscation.\n   - The functions `print_info()` and `print_version()` only output hardcoded strings.\n   - The main function checks for the `--version` argument and responds accordingly; otherwise, it defaults to printing package info.\n\n2. **Issues in the Code:**\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and does not perform any risky operations.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the script is benign, static, and only outputs informational text.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no malicious activity.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the thoroughness of their assessments.\n   - The reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 is correct, as there's no malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct, code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate, given the absence of vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n6. **Final Evaluation:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, I concur with the assessments.\n   - The code is a benign CLI utility with no security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, static CLI utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action is necessary.",
