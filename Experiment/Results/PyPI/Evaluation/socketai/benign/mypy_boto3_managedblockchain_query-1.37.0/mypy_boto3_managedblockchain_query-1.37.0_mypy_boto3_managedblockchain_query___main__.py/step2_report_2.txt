  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Code Confirmation:**\n- The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code does not handle any sensitive data, credentials, or perform network operations.\n- The functions simply write predefined strings to stdout.\n\n**2. Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- All reports correctly identify that the script is static and only outputs informational text.\n- No errors, flaws, or logical mistakes are evident in the reports' reasoning.\n\n**3. Score Review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores are consistent with the code's static, informational nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem appropriate.\n\n**4. Justification for Scores:**\n- The malware score is 0 because there's no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- The security risk is 0 as the script does not introduce any vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n**5. Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the script as benign.\n- No false positives or unwarranted risk assessments are evident.\n\n**6. Consistency and Final Assessment:**\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The code is a simple CLI utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal, static CLI script that displays package info and version. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions and scores.**",
