  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument, then either calls print_version or print_info functions, which write static strings to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated elements. All outputs are static informational texts.",
  "analysis": "The script functions solely as a CLI interface to display static package info and version. It reads command-line arguments to determine output, but does not process untrusted input beyond argument checking. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive operations are present. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves informational purposes only and does not perform any harmful actions.",
