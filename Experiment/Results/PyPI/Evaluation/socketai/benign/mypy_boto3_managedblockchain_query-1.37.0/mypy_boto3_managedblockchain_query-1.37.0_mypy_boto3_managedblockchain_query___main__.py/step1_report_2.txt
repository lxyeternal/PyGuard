  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface entry point for a Python package, providing version and package information.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reading command-line arguments), sys.stdout (printing to stdout)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputting information), potential command-line argument '--version'",
  "flows": "User runs script -> script checks for '--version' in sys.argv -> prints version or package info to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and primarily outputs static information. It reads command-line arguments and writes predefined text to stdout. There are no inputs that could be exploited, no network connections, and no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility providing package info and version details. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
