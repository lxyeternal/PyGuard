  "purpose": "Define static type annotations and string literal types for AWS managedblockchain-query service and related constants to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "No untrusted data sources; static definitions only, including type literals and conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No external data output, network communication, or data processing; purely static type annotations.",
  "flows": "N/A — static definitions without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard conditional import pattern for 'Literal' based on Python version, with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions for AWS service parameters, resource names, and query types. It uses conditional import for 'Literal' to maintain compatibility across Python versions. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, and no obfuscation. The purpose is to provide type hints for static analysis tools, not to perform any runtime operations or data handling. All patterns are standard and safe, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, static type stub for AWS SDK type annotations. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, aligning with its purpose as a purely declarative, static definitions file.",
