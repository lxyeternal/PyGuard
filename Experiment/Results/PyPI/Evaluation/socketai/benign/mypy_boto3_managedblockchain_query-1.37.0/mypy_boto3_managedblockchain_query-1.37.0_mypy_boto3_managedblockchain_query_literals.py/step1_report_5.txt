{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for the managedblockchain-query service and related AWS service identifiers for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from type annotations, the sys module for Python version detection, and static string definitions for literals.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code solely defines constants and type annotations without dynamic data handling or external I/O.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input or external data; the code only establishes static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses straightforward type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The script checks the Python version and imports 'Literal' accordingly, then defines multiple string literal types for use in type annotations. These definitions facilitate type safety and clarity for users of the AWS SDK stubs. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code appears to be standard for type hinting and documentation support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type annotations and constant definitions intended for static type checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a well-structured, static configuration code with no evidence of malicious intent.",
