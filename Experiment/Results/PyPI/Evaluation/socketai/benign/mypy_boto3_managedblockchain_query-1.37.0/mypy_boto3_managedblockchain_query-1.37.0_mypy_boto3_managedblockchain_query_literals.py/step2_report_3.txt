  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations and literals for the managedblockchain-query service. Uses standard imports and conditional import for 'Literal'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard practice.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely declarative, static type definitions with no malicious behavior. The confidence is high (1). Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar in scope—type literals for AWS service parameters, with conditional import. No external data handling or dynamic code.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is safe, static, and straightforward.\n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focused on static type definitions for AWS resource names and query parameters.\n- Uses standard conditional import based on Python version.\n- No data flow, external communication, or dynamic code.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous, defining string literal types for AWS resources.\n- Uses standard practices.\n- No suspicious patterns or external data handling.\n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Defines type annotations and literals for AWS services, with a version check for importing 'Literal'.\n- No dynamic code, external data, or malicious patterns.\n- The purpose is purely static type checking.\n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe static type alias definitions for AWS SDK type hints.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Security risk:** None evident; all are purely declarative.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any security issues, the risk score remains at 0.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is standard for type hinting and static analysis support.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or data processing.\n- No potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors are apparent.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a safe, standard set of type annotations and constants for AWS SDK stubs, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
