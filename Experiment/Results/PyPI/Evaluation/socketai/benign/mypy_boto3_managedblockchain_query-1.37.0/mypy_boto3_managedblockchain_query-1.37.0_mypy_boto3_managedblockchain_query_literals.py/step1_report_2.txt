{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various managedblockchain-query service parameters and related AWS service names.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module and use of sys.version_info to determine type annotation import; literals defining string constants for service parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external output present.",
  "flows": "The code sets up type aliases and conditional imports, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type definitions module, primarily for static type checking. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version and then declares multiple string literal types and lists for AWS service parameters. No input processing, no data leaks, no external interactions, and no malicious constructs are present. The content appears to be standard for type stubs, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type alias definitions file intended for static type annotations, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
