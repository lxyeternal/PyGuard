  "purpose": "Define type annotations and literals for managedblockchain-query service for use with boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, literal definitions for various string types.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external communications present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines constants and types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code found. Usage of conditional import based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a module of type annotations and string literal definitions for a specific AWS service, facilitating static type checking. It conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on Python version, which is standard practice. All literals are simple string values defining various constants and do not execute or manipulate data dynamically. No external data inputs, network communications, or system modifications are present. The code appears purely declarative and consistent with typical type stub files. No indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type annotations and constants for type checking, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It appears to be a standard, safe module used for defining types for AWS managedblockchain-query service.",
