  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a set of static type annotations and string literal definitions for AWS managedblockchain-query service.\n- The code is primarily for static type checking, with conditional imports based on Python version.\n- No external data handling, network communication, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, declarative, and serves as a utility module for type safety.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are detected in the code itself.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, flawed reasoning, or suspicious mistakes are evident.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscation scores as 0, and security risks as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Risk justification:** Since there's no malicious behavior, the risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly assigned as 0; no malicious activity or code obfuscation is present.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities as baseless, given the static nature of the code.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a standard, safe, static type annotations module.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured type stub module for AWS SDK type annotations. It poses no security threat or supply chain risk.",
