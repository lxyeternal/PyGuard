  "purpose": "Define type literals for managedblockchain-query service and related AWS resources for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions and conditional imports for Literal based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no unusual code patterns. The only notable aspect is the conditional import based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines string literal type annotations for various AWS resource names, service names, and query parameters. It includes a version check for importing 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', which is common for compatibility. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no data processing logic. The extensive list of string literals appears to be static, intended for type safety and validation in a larger codebase. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module providing type annotations for AWS managed blockchain query resources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It serves as a static type definition file, with no operational or security risks.",
