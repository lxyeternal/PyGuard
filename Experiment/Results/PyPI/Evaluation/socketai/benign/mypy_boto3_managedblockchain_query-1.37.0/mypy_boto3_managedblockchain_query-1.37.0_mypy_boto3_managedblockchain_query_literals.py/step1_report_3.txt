{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for managedblockchain-query service and related AWS service identifiers to be used for type safety in Python code.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions assigned directly to variables; import statements; conditional import based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or external data output; the code solely defines constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs to outputs; the code only sets up static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation observed; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static type definitions module for AWS managed blockchain query literals. It imports 'Literal' conditionally, defines multiple string literal types for various AWS service names, resource types, and query parameters. There is no evidence of data input handling, external communication, or dynamic code execution. The purpose is to enable type checking, not to process untrusted data or execute logic. No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified. The code is straightforward and primarily serves as a type annotation utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining static type annotations for a Python AWS SDK stub module. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. It is safe and unrelated to supply chain or malicious activity.",
