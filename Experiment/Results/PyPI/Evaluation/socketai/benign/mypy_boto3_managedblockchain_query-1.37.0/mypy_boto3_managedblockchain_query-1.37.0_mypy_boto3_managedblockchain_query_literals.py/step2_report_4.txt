  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, and ensure the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Defines type annotations and literals for the managedblockchain-query service. No dynamic logic, no external data, purely static definitions.\n- **Security & Malware:** No external communication, no data handling, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate, as the code is purely declarative.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring aligns with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to report 1—type literals and constants for AWS service parameters. No dynamic code or external interactions.\n- **Security & Malware:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are justified and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Defines string literal types for AWS resources and services. Standard static type definitions.\n- **Security & Malware:** No dynamic behavior, no external data, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar static type definitions, with a version check for importing 'Literal'.\n- **Security & Malware:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Static type annotations for AWS resources, no dynamic code.\n- **Security & Malware:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type annotations and constants.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- The risk scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or code.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and transparent.  \n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk, no external data handling.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe set of type annotations and literals for AWS SDK type checking. All scores are appropriate, and there are no security concerns.",
