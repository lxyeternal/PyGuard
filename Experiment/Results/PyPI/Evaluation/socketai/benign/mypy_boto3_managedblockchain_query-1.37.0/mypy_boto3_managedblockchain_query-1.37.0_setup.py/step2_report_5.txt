  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the script as a standard setup.py for packaging a Python module.\n- The code is static, reads a README for description, and calls `setuptools.setup()` with fixed metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description. No issues are present in the code itself.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** None identified, as the script is static and only handles package metadata.\n\n### Potential points of concern:\n- The only minor point is the conditional dependency `'typing-extensions; python_version<\"3.12\"'`, which is a common pattern to ensure compatibility. This is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware:** 0\n  - **obfuscated:** 0\n  - **securityRisk:** 0\n  - **risk:** 0.5 or below (mostly 0), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- The risk score is appropriately low; there's no reason to increase it.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.** They correctly identify the script as benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, well-formed setup.py script.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The scoring aligns with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms the assessments provided in the reports.",
