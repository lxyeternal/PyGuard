  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-managedblockchain-query Python module with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing setuptools for setup; reading version, package info, and dependencies from static strings and files.",
  "sinks": "None of the code indicates data processing, external data sinks, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Static data from variables and files flow into the setup() call to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a documentation file, and calls setuptools.setup() with static package metadata, versioning, URLs, and dependencies. The dependencies are fixed strings, and no user input is processed or executed. The code appears to be a standard, straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Python package setup script with no malicious intent, suspicious code, or security risks. It only defines package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner.",
