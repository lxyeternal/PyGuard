{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-managedblockchain-query package, providing metadata and configuration for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; static strings for package metadata; import statements for Path and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; no network operations, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A - no dynamic or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code follows standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup file that imports Path and setuptools, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setup() with static, well-defined metadata. No dynamic code, no user input, no network operations, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be straightforward and secure. All dependencies are explicitly specified with conditional environment markers. The script does not perform any operations that could compromise security or hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is benign, standard, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical package configuration file with no suspicious elements.",
