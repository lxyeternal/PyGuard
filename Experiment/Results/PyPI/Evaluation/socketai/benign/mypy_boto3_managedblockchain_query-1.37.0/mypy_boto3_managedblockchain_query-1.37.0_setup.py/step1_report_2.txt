  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and packaging options.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for long description, and uses package metadata provided directly in the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no runtime data processing or external inputs occur in this script.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for description, then passes static metadata to 'setup()' to create package distributions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The script uses standard setuptools setup practices. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, importing necessary modules, reading a description file, and invoking 'setup()' with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no external inputs, and no suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign, typical for Python package distribution. It contains no malware, malicious code, or security risks.",
