{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'mypy-boto3-managedblockchain-query' to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the package description from README.md, package metadata, and dependencies from install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to or executes untrusted data; no sinks that could cause data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata and description files; installs dependencies; defines package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments. The script is a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup process using setuptools, importing necessary modules, reading a README file, and defining package metadata. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network connections, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The install_requires conditionally includes a dependency based on Python version, which is a common pattern. The license, author, and URL fields are straightforward. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard, benign package configuration with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
