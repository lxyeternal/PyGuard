  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python module 'mypy-boto3-managedblockchain-query'.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; static metadata defined within the script; imports only standard modules and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Static data from README.md and hardcoded strings used directly in setup() call; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, no user input, no network activity, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, well-formed nature of the script. No issues or vulnerabilities are present, and the code does not perform any actions that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup configuration with no malicious or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
