{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'mypy-boto3-managedblockchain-query' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing 'setup' from setuptools, and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input; the script primarily defines package metadata and static configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content -> passes configuration data to setuptools.setup() -> package is built/distributed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures with metadata, dependencies, and package data. It reads a local README.md file for description, which is common. No external inputs are processed at runtime, no code injection points, and no sensitive data handling. All code is static configuration for package distribution. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate, standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
