  "purpose": "Defines the version of a software module",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string to __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input processing",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static assignment only",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future year (2025), which is inconsistent with the current year (2024), might suggest obfuscation or placeholder text; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code sets a __version__ variable to a static string. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The only noteworthy point is the future copyright year, which could be an inconsistency or placeholder but does not imply malicious intent. No obfuscated code, no suspicious functions, no secret data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with a potential inconsistency in the copyright year. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
