  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**  \n   - **Issue Confirmed?**: Yes, the code assigns a static string to `__version__`. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.  \n   - **Errors/Flaws**: The only anomaly is the copyright year \"2025\" which is in the future relative to the current year (2024). This could be a placeholder, typo, or oversight, but it does not imply malicious intent.  \n   - **Scores**: Malware and security risk are both 0, which is appropriate. Obfuscated is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity. The confidence is high (0.9).  \n   - **Justification for scores**: No malicious behavior, no data flow, no external input, and the only anomaly is a future date, which is not security-critical.  \n   \n2. **Report 2**  \n   - **Issue Confirmed?**: Yes, straightforward version assignment.  \n   - **Errors/Flaws**: No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n   - **Scores**: Malware and security risk are 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - **Justification**: No malicious activity, no external data, no obfuscation. The high confidence (1) is justified.  \n\n3. **Report 3**  \n   - **Issue Confirmed?**: Yes, static version string with a future copyright year.  \n   - **Errors/Flaws**: No malicious behavior. The future year could be a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't imply malicious intent.  \n   - **Scores**: Malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the benign nature.  \n   - **Confidence**: 1, justified given the simplicity.  \n\n4. **Report 4**  \n   - **Issue Confirmed?**: Yes, simple version assignment with a future year in the copyright.  \n   - **Errors/Flaws**: No malicious activity. The future year may be an inconsistency but not malicious.  \n   - **Scores**: Malware and security risk remain 0.  \n   - **Confidence**: 1, appropriate.  \n\n5. **Report 5**  \n   - **Issue Confirmed?**: Yes, straightforward version declaration.  \n   - **Errors/Flaws**: No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n   - **Scores**: Malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the code.  \n   - **Confidence**: 1, justified.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior, and the code is a simple version string assignment.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All are 0, as the code is straightforward and human-readable.  \n- **Risk Score**: Since there's no malicious activity, data flow, or security-sensitive operations, the risk score should remain at 0 across all reports.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\n- The only recurring anomaly is the future year \"2025\" in the copyright statement.  \n- While this could be a placeholder or typo, it does not introduce any security risks or malicious behavior.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 for all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 for all reports.  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 for all reports.  \n\n**Summary**: The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns. The only minor inconsistency is the future copyright year, which is not relevant to security or malware considerations.",
