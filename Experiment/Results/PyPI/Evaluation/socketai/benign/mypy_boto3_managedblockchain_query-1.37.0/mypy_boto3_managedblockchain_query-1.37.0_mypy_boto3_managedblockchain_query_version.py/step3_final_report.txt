  "flows": "N/A; static assignment, no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future year '2025' in the copyright comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string. No dynamic code, input handling, or external data interactions are present. The only anomaly is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future relative to the current year, likely a placeholder or typo. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor issue is the future copyright year, which does not impact security or functionality.",
