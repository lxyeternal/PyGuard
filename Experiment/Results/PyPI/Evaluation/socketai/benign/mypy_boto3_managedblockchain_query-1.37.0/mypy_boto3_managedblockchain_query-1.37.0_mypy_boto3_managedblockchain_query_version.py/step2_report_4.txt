  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code simply assigns a string `\"1.37.0\"` to the variable `__version__`.\n- It contains a copyright notice with the year 2025.\n- No inputs, outputs, external data, or dynamic code.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious functions, no embedded malware.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward; no malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which could be a placeholder, typo, or intentional placeholder for future updates.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify the future year as an inconsistency but do not suggest it indicates malicious intent.\n- No errors, flaws, or security issues are evident in the code.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only assigns a static string to a variable, the risk score should remain at 0.\n- The future copyright year does not elevate the risk unless it indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent, which is not supported here.\n\n### Potential claims about vulnerabilities:\n- Any claim that the code could be vulnerable based solely on its content is unfounded.\n- The only questionable aspect is the future year, which does not imply a security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The only minor point is the future year, which is likely a placeholder or typo but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the simplicity of the code and the analyses, I concur with the current scores. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code.",
