  "purpose": "Define the version string for the package or module",
  "sources": "Assignment of the __version__ variable from a string literal",
  "sinks": "None, no untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple assignment statement",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future year (2025), which is inconsistent with current date; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a copyright comment, a version variable assignment, and a copyright statement. The version is statically assigned. There are no input sources, no data processing, no dynamic code, and no suspicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future relative to current date and could indicate an inconsistency or outdated information, but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to declare a version string. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
