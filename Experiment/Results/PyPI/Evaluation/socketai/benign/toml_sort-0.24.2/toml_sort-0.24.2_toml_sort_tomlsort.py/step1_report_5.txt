{
  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes to sort and format TOML text, including handling comments, inline arrays, tables, and document structure.",
  "sources": "Reads input TOML string, parses with tomlkit, processes container items, comments, and whitespace, and generates sorted TOML output.",
  "sinks": "Uses tomlkit functions to parse and dump TOML, manipulates items, and re-serializes data; no direct untrusted data sinks that leak data or execute code.",
  "flows": "Input string -> parsing with tomlkit -> processing and sorting items -> re-serialization with tomlkit.dumps() -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Functions and methods perform standard parsing, manipulation, and formatting. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of a TOML sorting utility, relying on standard libraries and the tomlkit package. It manages parsing, sorting, and formatting of TOML documents, including comments and nested tables. The functions handle typical operations such as merging tables, normalizing whitespace/comments, and sorting keys with configurable options. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. Usage of 'tomlkit' is appropriate for parsing and serializing TOML files. No external inputs are executed or sent over the network. All operations appear to be strictly related to the input data provided and do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and well-structured TOML sorting utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely manipulates input data for formatting and ordering without engaging in harmful activities.",
