  "purpose": "To provide a library that allows easy sorting of TOML files.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .tomlsort module",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data processing or data leaks",
  "flows": "Import from the module, likely to be used for internal operations in TomlSort class",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class or function named TomlSort from a relative module. It only exposes this class/function via __all__, serving as a module interface. There is no evidence of data input, external network communication, or data manipulation. The code appears to be a simple package entry point with no malicious or suspicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a minimal module stub that exposes a TomlSort class. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this snippet.",
