  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports the 'TomlSort' class from a local module and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .tomlsort module",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, input, or output handling present",
  "flows": "None; the code only performs a static import and export",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module initializer with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package __init__.py file that imports a class and exposes it. It contains no data processing, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation. There are no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs. The code's purpose is solely to serve as an interface, and it does not handle untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are accurate and appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
