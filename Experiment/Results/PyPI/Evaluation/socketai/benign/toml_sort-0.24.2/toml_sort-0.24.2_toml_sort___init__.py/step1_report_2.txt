  "purpose": "A library to facilitate sorting of TOML files.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'TomlSort' from a local module '.tomlsort'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or insecure operations are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as the code does not process any input or execute untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module docstring, an import statement, and an __all__ declaration. There is no input handling, no execution of untrusted data, and no side effects. It appears to be a typical Python package __init__.py file that exposes a class for external use. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to expose the 'TomlSort' class for users, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
