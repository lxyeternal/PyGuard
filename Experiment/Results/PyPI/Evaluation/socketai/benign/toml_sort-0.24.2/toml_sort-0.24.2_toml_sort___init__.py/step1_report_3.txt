  "purpose": "A library to easily sort toml files.",

  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports a class or function 'TomlSort' from a local module '.tomlsort' and exposes it via __all__. It contains no logic, user input handling, or data processing. The code appears to be standard for a Python package's __init__.py file, setting up module exports. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign module initialization file with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
