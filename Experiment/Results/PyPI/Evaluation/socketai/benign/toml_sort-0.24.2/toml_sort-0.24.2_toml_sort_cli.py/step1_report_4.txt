  "purpose": "Command-line utility for sorting and formatting TOML files according to user-configurable options.",
  "sources": "Reads input files or stdin; loads 'pyproject.toml' configuration; reads and writes files based on user commands.",
  "sinks": "Writes sorted TOML content to files or stdout; reports errors to stderr.",
  "flows": "Input data (files or stdin) -> parse and process configuration -> apply sorting and formatting -> output or compare results -> report issues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Uses standard libraries and clear flow. No obfuscated code, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, no unusual data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a CLI for a TOML sorting utility, with configuration loaded from a 'pyproject.toml' file and command-line arguments. It reads input files or stdin, applies sorting/formatting, and writes output to files or stdout. Validation, error handling, and configuration parsing are straightforward and use standard Python libraries. No suspicious code, no malicious data leakage, no external network connections, and no hidden backdoors are present. The code appears to perform its intended purpose securely and transparently.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard command-line tool for sorting TOML files. It operates using well-known libraries and clear logic. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It is safe to use in supply chain contexts.",
