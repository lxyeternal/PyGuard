{
  "purpose": "The code implements a command-line interface for a TOML sorting utility, allowing users to format and sort TOML files with various options.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from files or stdin via read_file(), and loads configuration from pyproject.toml or command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to files or stdout via write_file(), and prints error messages to stderr.",
  "flows": "Input is read through read_file() (source), processed by TomlSort with user-defined configurations, and output via write_file() (sink). Command-line arguments influence behavior and configuration flow from argument parsing to application of sorting and formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments, hard-coded credentials, or backdoors. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious pattern observed. Configuration validation strictly checks types. No network or system modification code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file input/output operations, configuration parsing, and command-line argument handling without any suspicious behavior. It loads configurations from a local file, validates them, and applies sorting operations on TOML files. The use of open(), file reading/writing, and print statements are typical for CLI tools. No external network activity, system modification, or hidden behavior is detected. The only potential concern is that it reads and writes files, but this is expected for such a utility. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward CLI tool for sorting TOML files with configurable options. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, functions normally within its scope, and performs expected file processing tasks. It does not exhibit any malware behavior or supply chain sabotage signals.",
