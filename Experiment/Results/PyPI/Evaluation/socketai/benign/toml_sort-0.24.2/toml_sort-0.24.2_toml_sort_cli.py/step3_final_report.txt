  "purpose": "A CLI utility for sorting TOML files, supporting configuration via files and command-line arguments, with options for formatting and comment handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input from files or stdin, loads configuration from 'pyproject.toml' or command-line args.",
  "sinks": "Outputs sorted TOML to files or stdout; no untrusted data sinks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Reads files/streams -> parses configuration -> processes with TomlSort -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O, configuration parsing, argument validation, and invokes a well-defined sorting class. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external network calls are present. Validation and error handling are appropriate. External library 'tomlkit' is legitimate. The code's behavior aligns with a benign CLI utility for TOML file management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward utility with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
