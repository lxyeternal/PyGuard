{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility module for parsing and identifying AWS Lambda trigger events, extracting relevant metadata, and generating ARNs for different AWS resources.",
  "sources": "Event input data from AWS Lambda invocation (e.g., event dict), environment variables, and context (e.g., invoked_function_arn).",
  "sinks": "Constructed ARN strings, which could potentially be used for resource identification or further processing, but no data leaks or external effects are directly present.",
  "flows": "Event data is parsed from input dicts, with specific paths to identify event source, extract ARNs, and generate tags; no data is sent externally or executed dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard AWS event parsing and enumeration without obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution. No backdoors or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data parsing, classification, and string construction based on AWS event data. It includes functions for extracting event source types, generating ARNs, and tagging HTTP request metadata. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as network communication, system modification, or credential handling are present. The usage of base64 decoding, gzip decompression, and JSON parsing is for log processing and event metadata extraction, all within expected patterns. Overall, the logic is straightforward, focusing on AWS event handling without any malicious or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility module for AWS Lambda event processing, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs standard parsing and resource identification tasks, with no external communication or hidden behaviors. The likelihood of malicious activity is extremely low.",
