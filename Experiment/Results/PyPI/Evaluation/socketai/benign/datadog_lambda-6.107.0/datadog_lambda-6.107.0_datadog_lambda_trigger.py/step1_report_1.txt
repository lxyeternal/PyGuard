{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to parse and identify various AWS event sources, extract relevant metadata, and generate tags for monitoring or logging purposes within serverless applications.",
  "sources": "Reads event data from AWS Lambda invocation, including event dictionaries, request context, headers, and base64-encoded logs.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written to external sources or transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "Event data is read from input event dictionaries and processed through multiple functions to determine event source, parse ARNs, and extract tags.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow are present. The code primarily processes AWS event data in a standard manner.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes well-known AWS event patterns to identify sources like API Gateway, S3, SNS, SQS, CloudWatch logs, CloudFront, DynamoDB, Kinesis, and Step Functions. It extracts ARNs and metadata for these sources and generates tags accordingly. All operations involve standard data processing and decoding (e.g., base64, gzip, json). No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a utility module for event parsing and tagging, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AWS event parsing utility, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It correctly identifies and processes various AWS event types for monitoring purposes. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected.",
