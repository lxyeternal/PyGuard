  "purpose": "AWS Lambda event parsing and resource identification utility, extracting event source types, ARNs, and tags for monitoring.",
  "sources": "Event data such as 'Records', 'requestContext', 'awslogs', 'detail', 'payload', headers, and specific fields within event dicts.",
  "sinks": "Generated ARNs, event source tags, HTTP metadata, and resource identifiers used for monitoring and alerting.",
  "flows": "Event data flows from input to parsing functions, which extract source types, ARNs, and tags without external communication or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. Minor stylistic note: 'base64' imported inside a function, but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AWS event source detection, ARN extraction, and tagging. It decodes logs with base64 and gzip, which is typical for CloudWatch logs. No network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The functions are straightforward, with clear logic and no obfuscation. The dynamic import of 'base64' is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the code is a benign utility for AWS Lambda event processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured AWS event parser with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to handling untrusted log data, which is normal. The overall assessment confirms a benign security posture.",
