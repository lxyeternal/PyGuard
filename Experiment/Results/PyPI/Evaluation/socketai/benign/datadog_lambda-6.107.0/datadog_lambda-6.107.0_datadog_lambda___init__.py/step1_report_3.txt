  "purpose": "Initialize Datadog Lambda monitoring and telemetry settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DD_INSTRUMENTATION_TELEMETRY_ENABLED, DD_API_SECURITY_ENABLED), imported functions from datadog_lambda modules.",
  "sinks": "initialize_cold_start_tracing(), initialize_logging() functions, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are set at the start; initialize_cold_start_tracing() and initialize_logging() utilize these settings for telemetry and logging setup.",
  "anomalies": "Environment variables are set with default values, but no sensitive information or secrets are hardcoded. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions for cold start tracing and logging from Datadog's Lambda library. It sets environment variables to enable telemetry and security features if they are not already set. These variables control instrumentation behavior. The functions are called immediately after setting environment variables to initialize tracing and logging. No data is being read from untrusted sources; environment variables are controlled within the Lambda environment. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be standard setup code for observability tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard initialization script for Datadog Lambda monitoring, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It configures telemetry and security features via environment variables and initializes tracing and logging functions. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
