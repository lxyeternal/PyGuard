{
  "purpose": "Initialize DataDog Lambda monitoring and tracing configurations, set environment variables if not present, and set up logging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ.get), imported functions (initialize_cold_start_tracing, initialize_logging), module imports",
  "sinks": "None directly, as no untrusted data output or external network operations are present",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and conditionally set; functions are called to initialize tracing and logging without data flow manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. Environment variables are set to default values but not in a suspicious manner.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from DataDog modules, checks for the presence of environment variables related to DataDog instrumentation, sets default values if missing, and initializes tracing and logging. No data leakage, no external connections, and no malicious intent are evident. The environment variable modifications are typical for configuration purposes, not malicious. No obfuscated code, no malicious patterns, and no suspicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard initialization code for DataDog Lambda monitoring and logging setup. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on the provided content.",
