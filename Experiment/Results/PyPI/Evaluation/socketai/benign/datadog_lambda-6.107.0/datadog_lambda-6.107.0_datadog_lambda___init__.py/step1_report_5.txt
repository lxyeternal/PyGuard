  "purpose": "Initialize Datadog Lambda monitoring and telemetry configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DD_INSTRUMENTATION_TELEMETRY_ENABLED, DD_API_SECURITY_ENABLED)",
  "sinks": "Potential configuration of telemetry and security features, no direct data output or network sinks present",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and possibly set, then initialize_cold_start_tracing() and initialize_logging() are called",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. Environment variables are set to disable telemetry and security features if not already set, which is a standard configuration step",
  "analysis": "The code sets environment variables related to Datadog telemetry and security if they are not already set, then initializes cold start tracing and logging for Datadog Lambda. The code uses standard library functions, calls initialization routines, and imports modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The code appears to be part of standard monitoring setup for a serverless application.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical setup tasks for Datadog Lambda monitoring with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks. It is a standard, safe initialization script.",
