  "purpose": "Initialize DataDog Lambda tracing and logging configurations for a serverless environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DD_INSTRUMENTATION_TELEMETRY_ENABLED, DD_API_SECURITY_ENABLED)",
  "sinks": "Environment variables potentially influencing DataDog configurations",
  "flows": "Environment variable reads → Conditional checks → Setting environment variables → Initialization functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Environment variables are used in a standard manner.",
  "analysis": "The code sets default environment variables related to DataDog instrumentation and security if they are not already set, then initializes tracing and logging for a Lambda environment. The variables are used to control telemetry and API security features. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior are observed. The code relies on external modules (datadog_lambda) which are common for this use case. No obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for DataDog Lambda monitoring, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly initializes environment variables and configurations in a standard manner.",
