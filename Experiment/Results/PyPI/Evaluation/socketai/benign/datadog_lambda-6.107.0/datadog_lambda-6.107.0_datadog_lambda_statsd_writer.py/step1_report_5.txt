{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for writing distribution metrics using DataDog's StatsD protocol, likely intended for monitoring or telemetry in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from datadog_lambda.stats_writer and datadog_lambda.dogstatsd, specifically the statsd object which is used to send metrics.",
  "sinks": "The statsd.distribution method sends metrics data, potentially over the network to a DataDog server.",
  "flows": "Metrics data (metric_name, value, tags) flow from the distribution() method to statsd.distribution, which transmits the data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data observed. The code relies on external datadog_lambda modules; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The class extends StatsWriter and provides a method distribution that calls statsd.distribution with provided parameters, sending data to DataDog. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling. The flush() and stop() methods are placeholders, which do not impact security. The code appears to implement standard telemetry functionality without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, implementing standard metrics reporting via DataDog without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks are evident from this snippet.",
