{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom StatsD writer class for sending metrics using the DataDog Lambda integration.",
  "sources": "Imports from datadog_lambda.stats_writer and datadog_lambda.dogstatsd; the distribution method calls statsd.distribution",
  "sinks": "The statsd.distribution call could send data over the network; however, it depends on the external library's implementation, which is not shown here.",
  "flows": "distribution() method takes metric data and forwards it via statsd.distribution, potentially sending data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code appears straightforward, utilizing the DataDog library's functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports DataDog Lambda metrics writer classes and extends a StatsWriter class with a custom distribution method. It relies on the datadog_lambda library, which is an established monitoring library. The distribution method forwards data to statsd, which typically sends metrics over UDP. There are no suspicious data flows, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The flush() and stop() methods are placeholders and do not contain code that could be malicious. Overall, the code seems to be a simple extension for metric reporting without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension for reporting metrics using DataDog's StatsD protocol. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It simply forwards metrics through an established library.",
