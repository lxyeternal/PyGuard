{
  "purpose": "A simple wrapper class for sending distribution metrics via Datadog's StatsD protocol.",
  "sources": "Method parameters 'metric_name', 'value', 'tags', and 'timestamp' in 'distribution()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'statsd.distribution()' call potentially sends data over the network to Datadog's servers.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from 'distribution()' method to 'statsd.distribution()', which transmits data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The 'timestamp' parameter is accepted but not used; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Datadog Lambda libraries, defines a subclass that forwards metrics, and contains no suspicious or malicious code. It does not perform any data sanitization or validation, but this is typical for metrics reporting. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The network activity is standard for telemetry and monitoring purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a metrics reporting class. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The data flow is transparent, and the external network activity is typical for such monitoring tools.",
