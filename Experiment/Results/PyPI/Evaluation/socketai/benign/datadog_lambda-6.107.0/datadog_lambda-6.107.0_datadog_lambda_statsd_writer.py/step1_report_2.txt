{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom implementation for writing distribution metrics using the StatsD protocol in a monitoring context.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'datadog_lambda' libraries, specifically 'statsd' which is used to send metrics.",
  "sinks": "The 'statsd.distribution' method could send data over the network to an external monitoring server.",
  "flows": "The 'distribution' method receives metric data and forwards it via 'statsd.distribution', potentially over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code observed. Usage of monitoring libraries alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from 'StatsWriter', with methods to send distribution metrics via 'statsd'. There is no user input processing, data leaks, or suspicious network activity other than standard metrics reporting. The 'statsd' object is imported from a monitoring library, likely used to send data to a remote server. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard metrics reporting class using Datadog's StatsD protocol. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. It acts as a benign utility for telemetry data collection.",
