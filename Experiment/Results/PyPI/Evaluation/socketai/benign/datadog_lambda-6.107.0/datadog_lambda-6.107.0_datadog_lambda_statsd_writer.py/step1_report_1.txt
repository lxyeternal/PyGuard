{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom StatsD writer class for sending distribution metrics using the Datadog Lambda library.",
  "sources": "Imports from datadog_lambda.stats_writer and datadog_lambda.dogstatsd; method calls to statsd.distribution",
  "sinks": "Usage of statsd.distribution function could send data to external monitoring services",
  "flows": "No complex data flows or untrusted input sources; data flows from method parameters to statsd.distribution",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscation or hidden behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes for metric writing, defines a subclass with a distribution method that forwards data to the statsd client, and provides empty methods for flush and stop. The distribution method does not perform any validation or sanitization, but since it uses an established library for metrics, this is typical. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious data exfiltration; the code appears to be straightforward metric forwarding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper around the Datadog Lambda statsd client for sending distribution metrics. It does not contain any malicious intent or suspicious behavior, and there are no security risks identified.",
