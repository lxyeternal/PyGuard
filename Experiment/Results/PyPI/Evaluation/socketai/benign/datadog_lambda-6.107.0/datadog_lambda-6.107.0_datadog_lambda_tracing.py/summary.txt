  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured observability library for AWS Lambda functions, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to handling external data, which is typical for such tools. The malware score is zero, obfuscation is absent, and the overall risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting cautious handling of external inputs but no malicious intent."
