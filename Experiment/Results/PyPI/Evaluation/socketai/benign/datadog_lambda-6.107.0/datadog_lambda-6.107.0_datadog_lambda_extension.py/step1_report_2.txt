  "purpose": "Check for the presence of a specific extension directory and, if present, send an HTTP request to a local agent endpoint to trigger a flush operation.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists() for checking directory existence; import urllib.request; usage of AGENT_URL and FLUSH_PATH for URL request construction.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for sending an HTTP request to a potentially local agent.",
  "flows": "Presence of extension directory (source) leads to sending an HTTP request (sink) via urllib.request.urlopen().",
  "anomalies": "Code communicates with a local URL (127.0.0.1) which may be benign but could also be used for local inter-process communication. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic. Use of a network request to localhost is common but may be malicious if used maliciously, though no malicious intent is evident here.",
  "analysis": "The script checks if a specific directory exists to determine if an extension is present. If so, it sends an HTTP request to a local agent at 127.0.0.1:8124/ lambda/flush. The request is sent without any additional data or headers, and errors are caught and logged at debug level. The code appears to be part of a monitoring or extension management system. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activity are detected. The network request to localhost is standard for local services, assuming the service at that address is legitimate. Overall, the code performs a benign check and trigger operation with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily checking for an extension and triggering a local flush operation via HTTP request. No malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage is detected.",
