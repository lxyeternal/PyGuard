  "flows": "is_extension_present() checks file existence -> flush_extension() makes network request if extension exists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials other than local URL; no obfuscated code; network request to localhost is common, but could be suspicious if used maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if a specific extension directory exists on the local filesystem. If present, it attempts to send an HTTP request to a local agent endpoint to trigger a flush operation. The URL points to localhost, which is typical for internal services. The network request uses standard urllib functions with no user input involved. There are no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The overall logic appears straightforward and intended for internal maintenance or communication. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are evident. The code does not perform any data exfiltration or harmful actions. However, the purpose relies on local environment setup, and in a compromised environment, such communication could be exploited. Nonetheless, based on this code alone, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is intended to check for a local extension and trigger a flush via an HTTP request. There are no signs of malicious activity or sabotage in the given snippet. It is likely part of a legitimate internal operation, with no malware or security risks detected.",
