{
  "purpose": "To modify a module name string by replacing slashes with dots, presumably to convert a filesystem path into a Python import path.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'module_name' which is a string that may be provided externally.",
  "sinks": "The returned string used as a module name for import statements.",
  "flows": "Input 'module_name' → String split and join operations → Output string for import.",
  "anomalies": "The function performs straightforward string manipulation with no embedded code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. No external data sources or network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a string 'module_name', splits it by '/', and joins the parts with '.', producing a string suitable for importing modules in Python. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious side effects. The operation is simple and safe, used commonly to convert filesystem paths to module paths.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility function for string manipulation to facilitate module imports. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
