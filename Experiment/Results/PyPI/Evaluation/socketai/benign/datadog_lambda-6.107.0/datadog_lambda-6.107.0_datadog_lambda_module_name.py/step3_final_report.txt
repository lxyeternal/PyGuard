  "purpose": "Convert filesystem path-like module names into Python import path format by replacing '/' with '.'",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'module_name' provided to the function",
  "sinks": "None; the function performs string manipulation only",
  "flows": "Input string split on '/', then joined with '.'; no external data or code execution involved",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward string split and join without obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code takes a string, splits it on '/', and joins the parts with '.', effectively converting path notation to import notation. No code injection, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present. The logic is simple and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assign malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk 0, with high confidence. The function's purpose is a common utility, and no vulnerabilities are introduced.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function performing a simple string transformation. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
