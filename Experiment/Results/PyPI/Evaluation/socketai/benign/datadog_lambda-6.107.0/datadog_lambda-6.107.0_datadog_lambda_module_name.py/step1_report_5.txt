{
  "purpose": "The function modifies a module name string by replacing slashes with dots, likely to convert file path formats into Python import module names.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'module_name' is the source of data, obtained externally as a string.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs a modified string used for importing modules; it does not directly invoke import or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input 'module_name' is split by '/' and joined by '.', producing a string intended for import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The function performs straightforward string manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility to convert file path notation into Python module notation. There are no external calls, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior. It doesn't execute or evaluate untrusted data beyond string transformation. No suspicious or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign string conversion to facilitate module import naming. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk detected.",
