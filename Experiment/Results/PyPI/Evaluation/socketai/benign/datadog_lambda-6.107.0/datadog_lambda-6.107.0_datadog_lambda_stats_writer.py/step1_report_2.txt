{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for writing statistical data, with methods for distribution, flushing, and stopping operations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in the code; it is only a class definition with method declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs; no untrusted data processing or output is performed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the class contains only method signatures without implementations or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The class is purely abstract with method placeholders; no implementation details or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class 'StatsWriter' with three methods that raise NotImplementedError, indicating they are intended to be overridden in subclasses. No actual logic, data handling, or data flows exist in this snippet. The code appears to be a standard pattern for abstract classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple abstract interface for statistical writing, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not process or handle data directly, and no suspicious behavior is evident.",
