{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract class 'StatsWriter' intended as a base for subclasses that implement statistics writing functionalities.",
  "sources": "The class contains no data input sources; it only defines method signatures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the class only declares abstract methods without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious constructs. It is a minimal abstract class with no implementation details.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a class with three methods that raise NotImplementedError. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic. It serves as an interface or abstract base class for other classes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The absence of implementation details limits further analysis but does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple abstract class defining an interface for statistics writing. It shows no signs of malware, malicious activity, or security risks. The code is benign and likely part of a larger codebase where subclasses will implement the actual logic.",
