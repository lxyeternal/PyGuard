  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code in question is a class with only method signatures raising NotImplementedError.\n- No data input/output, no external calls, no logic, no data flows.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.\n- The code appears to be a standard abstract class or interface pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of abstract methods raising NotImplementedError:** This is typical for interfaces or base classes. No issues here.\n- **No data handling, no external dependencies, no malicious patterns:** Confirmed by all reports.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **None identified.** The code is straightforward and standard for an abstract interface.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, unobfuscated code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the lack of data handling or security-sensitive operations.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely an interface with no logic, data, or external interactions, the risk is minimal.\n- No reason to increase scores above 0.0 or 0.5.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- Any claim that this code is malicious or risky is unfounded; it’s a standard pattern.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessments.\n- The scores align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security concern)\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard abstract class/interface definition with no security issues.",
