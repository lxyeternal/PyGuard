{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for writing statistical data, with methods for distribution, flushing, and stopping.",
  "sources": "Method signatures that accept parameters like metric_name, value, tags, timestamp; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "None; the methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError with no internal logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a straightforward abstract class with no unusual patterns or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a class with three methods that raise NotImplementedError, indicating an abstract base class pattern. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. The code's purpose is to serve as an interface for subclasses to implement specific behavior. Given its simplicity and standard pattern, there are no vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract class defining an interface for statistics writing. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
