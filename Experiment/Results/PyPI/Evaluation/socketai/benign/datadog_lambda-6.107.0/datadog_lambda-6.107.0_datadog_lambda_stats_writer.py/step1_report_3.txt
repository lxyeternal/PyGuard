  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for writing statistical data, including methods for distribution, flushing, and stopping.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs within this class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; methods are placeholders that raise NotImplementedError.",
  "flows": "No execution or data flow within this code snippet, as it contains only abstract method definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The class is purely an interface with no implementation or embedded suspicious code; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with three methods that are intended to be overridden by subclasses. All methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating this is an abstract base class. There are no data inputs, outputs, or execution flows. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. The class appears to be a standard interface pattern, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract interface definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any data processing or system interaction, posing no security risks.",
