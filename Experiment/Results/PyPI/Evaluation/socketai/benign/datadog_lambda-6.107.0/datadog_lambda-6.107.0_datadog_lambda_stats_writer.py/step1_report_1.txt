  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for writing statistical data with methods for distribution, flush, and stop.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or produce outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; methods are abstract and not implemented.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of abstract methods raising NotImplementedError is typical for interface definitions; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with three methods intended as an interface. All methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating they are meant to be implemented by subclasses. There are no data inputs, no external calls, and no suspicious patterns. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The structure suggests a clean, standard abstract class pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract class interface with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It merely establishes method signatures for subclasses to implement.",
