  "purpose": "Abstract base class defining an interface for writing statistical data and controlling the writer's lifecycle.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted input, as all methods are unimplemented stubs.",
  "anomalies": "The class contains only method signatures with NotImplementedError, no executable code or logic; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with three methods that raise NotImplementedError, serving as an interface or base class for subclasses. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic, and no suspicious or malicious activity is present. The code appears to be a placeholder or interface definition with no executable or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward interface definition with no executable logic, data handling, or malicious components. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
