{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate and parse AWS Lambda function tags based on the Lambda ARN and context, and to provide enhanced metric tags for Datadog monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reads data from lambda_context (ARN, function version, memory limit), version info (__version__), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to external systems, but it constructs tag strings based on input data, which could be used downstream for monitoring or logging.",
  "flows": "Data flows from lambda_context input into parsing functions; tags are constructed based on ARN components and context, then returned for monitoring purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code includes standard string manipulations and conditional logic for parsing ARNs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward parsing of AWS Lambda ARNs and context to generate tags for monitoring. It uses string splitting, conditional checks, and appends tags accordingly. The check_if_number function safely determines if a string can be converted to a float, which is harmless. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated code present. All functions serve clear, benign purposes related to tag generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for AWS Lambda monitoring with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is well-structured and focuses solely on generating tags based on Lambda context. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
