{
  "purpose": "The code generates AWS Lambda function tags based on the function's ARN and context, and provides enhanced metrics tags for Datadog monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reads lambda_context.arn, lambda_context.function_version, lambda_context.memory_limit_in_mb, and imported modules (__version__, get_cold_start_tag).",
  "sinks": "None; the code primarily processes data and generates tags without external output or data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data from lambda_context (ARN, version, memory) flows through parsing and conditional logic to generate tags; no external data flows or injections are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; functions perform standard string parsing, conditional checks, and tag formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard string manipulation and tagging logic for AWS Lambda functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It does not include any network activity, system modifications, or backdoors. Usage of check_if_number function is a simple numeric check. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The logic is straightforward and focused on tag generation for monitoring purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for generating Lambda function tags for monitoring. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious data leaks, or suspicious behaviors.",
