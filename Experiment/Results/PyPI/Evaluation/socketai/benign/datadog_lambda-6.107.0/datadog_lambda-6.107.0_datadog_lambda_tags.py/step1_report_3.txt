{
  "purpose": "The code generates and manages AWS Lambda function tags based on the lambda's ARN, version, alias, and environment details, primarily for monitoring and metrics purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the lambda context object, specifically the 'invoked_function_arn', 'function_version', and 'memory_limit_in_mb' attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leakage or malicious actions; tags are generated internally for monitoring purposes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'lambda_context' input to parsing functions, then to tag generation functions, with no external data sinks or network transmissions involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard string manipulations and conditional checks. The function 'check_if_number' relies on float conversion, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, focusing on extracting and formatting lambda function details into tags for monitoring. It parses the ARN to determine region, account ID, function name, and version or alias, then generates tags accordingly. It uses simple string splitting, conditional logic, and a float conversion to identify numeric aliases. No external network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions serve a monitoring purpose, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, monitoring and tagging AWS Lambda functions based on context data. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is well-structured for its intended purpose and does not exhibit suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
