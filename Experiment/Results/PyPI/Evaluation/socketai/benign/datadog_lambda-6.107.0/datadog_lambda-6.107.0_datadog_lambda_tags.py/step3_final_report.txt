  "purpose": "Generate AWS Lambda tags based on the lambda context, including ARN parsing, version/alias handling, and environment info.",
  "sources": "lambda_context.arn, lambda_context.function_version, lambda_context.memory_limit_in_mb",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or transmit data externally",
  "flows": "Parsing arn -> extracting region, account_id, function_name, alias/version -> generating tags based on these values",
  "anomalies": "Use of float() in check_if_number to determine if alias is numeric; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code parses AWS Lambda ARN to extract region, account ID, function name, and alias or version. It handles special cases such as aliases starting with '$' and numeric versions. It generates tags accordingly and appends environment info like memory size, runtime, and library version. The code is straightforward, with no external network calls, data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The check_if_number function safely determines if an alias is numeric. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very low) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating AWS Lambda monitoring tags. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the overall security risk is negligible. No adjustments are necessary.",
