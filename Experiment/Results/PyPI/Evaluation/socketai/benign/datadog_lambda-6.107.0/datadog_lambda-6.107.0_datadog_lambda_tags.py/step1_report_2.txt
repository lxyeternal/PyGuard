{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to generate and manage AWS Lambda function tags for Datadog monitoring, including parsing Lambda ARNs and collecting environment information for enhanced metrics.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Lambda context object (lambda_context), specifically the 'arn' attribute and 'function_version', as well as environment-specific tags from 'lambda_context'. It also uses the 'sys.version_info' and imported modules for versioning information.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data outputs are present. The code primarily processes internal data to generate tags without writing or transmitting data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'lambda_context' object into parsing functions, which generate tags based on ARN and context attributes, with no external data injections or outputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code are present. The functions are straightforward and rely on standard Python features and imported modules.",
  "analysis": "The code analyzes Lambda ARN strings to extract region, account ID, function name, and alias or version information. It then constructs tag strings accordingly. It also gathers environment info like memory size and runtime version for enhanced metrics. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The functions operate solely on provided context data without any external or secret data access. There are no obfuscation signs, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for generating monitoring tags for AWS Lambda functions in a Datadog context. It appears safe, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to process and generate tags based on Lambda runtime information.",
