{
  "purpose": "The code generates and manages AWS Lambda function tags based on the lambda context for monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads lambda_context input, specifically lambda_context.arn, lambda_context.function_version, and lambda_context.memory_limit_in_mb.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No untrusted data processing or external communications.",
  "flows": "Uses lambda_context data to create tags for monitoring. No external data flows or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The functions are straightforward data processing routines.",
  "analysis": "The script uses lambda context data to parse ARN, determine function versions or aliases, and generate monitoring tags. It performs basic string manipulations and conditional checks. No suspicious code paths, obfuscated code, or external network activities are present. No hardcoded secrets or insecure data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for tag generation in AWS Lambda monitoring. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code fragment.",
