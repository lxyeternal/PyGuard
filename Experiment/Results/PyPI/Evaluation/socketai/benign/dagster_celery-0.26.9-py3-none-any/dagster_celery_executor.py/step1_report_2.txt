{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Celery-based executor for the Dagster workflow orchestration framework, allowing tasks to be executed asynchronously via Celery workers with configurable settings.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables in the broker URL description, user-provided configuration values for broker, backend, include modules, and config_source, as well as data from plan_context and reconstructable jobs during task submission.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could flow into the execute_step_args via pack_value, and into the task signature applied asynchronously. There are no explicit data sinks that could lead to data leakage or system effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration inputs into the CeleryExecutor class, especially into init parameters, then through the execute method into the core_celery_execution_loop, and finally into task creation and asynchronous submission via Celery. Environment variables are only referenced in descriptions, not used directly in code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code dynamically constructs environment-dependent URLs but does not directly access environment variables; descriptions mention environment variables but do not execute code based on untrusted input. The code employs standard, well-understood library functions and patterns. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a configurable Celery executor for Dagster with options for broker URL, backend, modules to include, and additional config. It constructs task signatures and submits them asynchronously. The environment variable references are only in documentation strings, not in executable code. There are no hidden backdoors, code injections, or malicious network actions. Usage of external modules like dagster and celery is standard. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or dangerous behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a Celery executor for Dagster, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It relies on standard patterns and configurations, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities in the provided code.",
