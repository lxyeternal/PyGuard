{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a Celery executor for Dagster workflows, enabling distributed task execution with configurable settings.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters such as 'broker', 'backend', 'include', and 'config_source'; environment variables referenced only in documentation strings; data serialization via 'pack_value'; task creation through 'create_task'.",
  "sinks": "Serialization of execution arguments, creation of Celery task signatures, and dispatch via 'apply_async' with specified priority and routing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'CeleryExecutor' initialization; 'execute' method invokes 'core_celery_execution_loop' passing '_submit_task'; '_submit_task' serializes 'ExecuteStepArgs' and applies the task asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns; environment variables are only mentioned in docstrings, not used in runtime logic; no obfuscated code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a Dagster Celery executor. It uses environment variables solely in documentation, not in executable code, reducing security concerns. Serialization and task dispatch mechanisms follow typical patterns without suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The configuration handling appears secure and appropriate. Overall, the code demonstrates legitimate functionality with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Celery executor for Dagster, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. Environment variables are only referenced in documentation strings, and the task dispatching process is standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with a safe, production-ready component.",
