  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Celery executor for Dagster, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. Environment variables are only referenced in documentation strings, and the task dispatching process is standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with a safe, production-ready component."
