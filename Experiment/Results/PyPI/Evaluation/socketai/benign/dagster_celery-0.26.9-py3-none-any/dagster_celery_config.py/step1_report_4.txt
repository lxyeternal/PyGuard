  "purpose": "Define default configuration for Celery tasks in a Dagster integration, including transport options and task priorities, and a utility class for dictionary attribute access.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dagster_celery.defaults' for configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data is sent or stored unsafely.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables imported and assigned; no data flow from external input to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "The 'dict_wrapper' class, while unconventional, is a simple wrapper without any suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration options for Celery tasks, assigns them into a dictionary, and defines a utility class for attribute-style dict access. The configuration is standard and does not involve untrusted inputs or malicious logic. The utility class is straightforward and not obfuscated. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors are present. The code is minimal and clear, primarily setting up configuration constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration and utility setup for Celery tasks within a Dagster context. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
