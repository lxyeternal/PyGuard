  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is straightforward; no suspicious elements or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risks. The confidence score of 1 is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues detected; the code is simple configuration.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Again, a benign configuration setup.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard configuration code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No suspicious behavior or malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is standard configuration with a utility class.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, reflecting benign configuration code with no security risks.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the scores assigned in all reports. The code is purely configuration and utility setup, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the detailed reasoning above.",
