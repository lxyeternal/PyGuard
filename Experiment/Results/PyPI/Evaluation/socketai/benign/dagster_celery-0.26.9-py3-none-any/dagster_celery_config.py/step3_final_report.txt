  "purpose": "This code sets up configuration parameters for Celery tasks within the Dagster framework, importing defaults and wrapping them into a dictionary for flexible access.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dagster_celery.defaults' providing configuration defaults.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static configuration with no data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The 'dict_wrapper' class is a common utility pattern; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup importing defaults, assigning them into a dictionary, and defining a utility class for attribute access. It does not process untrusted input, perform external communication, or execute dynamic code. The class and constants are standard and harmless. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 with high confidence. No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are present, and the code's purpose is clear and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with a utility class, showing no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
