{
  "purpose": "This code defines default configuration parameters for Celery tasks in a Dagster integration, and provides a wrapper class to access dictionary attributes as object attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from dagster_celery.defaults; assignment of constants and configuration dictionary; class constructor reading a dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external inputs are processed or written.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; configuration and class instantiation are static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The dict_wrapper class uses a non-standard naming convention and dynamic attribute assignment, but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up configuration parameters for Celery tasks, referencing values imported from a third-party library. The dict_wrapper class simplifies access to dictionaries but doesn't execute external code or handle untrusted data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads. All elements appear to be standard configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with a simple utility class, containing no malicious intent or security risks. There are no indicators of malware or suspicious activity.",
