{
  "purpose": "The code defines default configuration settings for Celery tasks within the Dagster framework, including a utility class for dict attribute access.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dagster_celery.defaults' and class initialization with a dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leakage are present.",
  "flows": "The imported configuration variables are assigned to a dictionary object; the class wraps a dictionary for attribute-style access.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior. The dict_wrapper class is a simple utility and not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific configuration parameters from an external module, then creates a default configuration dictionary that reuses those parameters. The 'dict_wrapper' class allows attribute-style access to a dictionary, which is a common utility pattern. No input is received from untrusted sources, and no malicious or suspicious code behavior is evident. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is benign and appears to serve a configuration and utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup with a utility class. There is no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious anomalies detected. It is safe.",
