  "purpose": "Define string constants used as tags for Celery task management within a Dagster integration, including priority settings, queue selection, and task ID monitoring.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "None; the code only assigns constants without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with clear variable definitions and no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constant definitions used for tagging and configuration in Celery and Dagster contexts. There are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, or code execution. The constants serve as identifiers for priorities, queues, and task IDs. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and purpose as configuration constants indicate a benign intent. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet defining string constants for task management tags. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The current assessment and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
