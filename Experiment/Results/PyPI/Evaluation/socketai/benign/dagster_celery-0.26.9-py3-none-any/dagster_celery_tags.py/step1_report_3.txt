  "purpose": "Define string constants for Celery task and job metadata tags used in a data pipeline system.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments assigning tag names for Celery-related metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data input points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink pathways; only static string definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or hidden functionality detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of defining string constants representing metadata tags for Celery tasks in a data pipeline context. These tags include priority levels, queue selection, and task identification. There are no input sources, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears straightforward and well-defined, serving configuration or documentation purposes. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign set of constant definitions used for metadata tagging in a Celery-based workflow system. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
