  "purpose": "Define constants for tagging Celery-related parameters in a Dagster workflow",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned string values; no external input reading observed",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points detected; constants are for internal tagging only",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; these are static string definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code only defines string constants used for tagging within a distributed task system (Celery) in a data pipeline context. No input reading, data processing, or external communication occurs. The constants are appropriately named for their purposes and contain no suspicious or malicious content. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and consists solely of constant definitions for internal use in a Celery-based data pipeline. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
