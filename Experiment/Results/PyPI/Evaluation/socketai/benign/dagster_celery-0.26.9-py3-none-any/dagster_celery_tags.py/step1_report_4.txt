  "purpose": "Define string constants for Celery task and job metadata tags used in a DAGster workflow integration",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments defining tag names",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output operations or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "None; these are static constants without data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward constant definitions for tag identifiers used in Celery tasks within a DAGster context. All are plain string assignments with clear, descriptive names. There are no dynamic operations, no input handling, and no external data sources. The constants seem intended for tagging or metadata purposes related to task priority, queue selection, and task identification. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code is simple and transparent, with no obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines constants for use as tags in a Celery-DAGster workflow. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and typical for configuration or constant declaration purposes.",
