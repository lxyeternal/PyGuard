  "purpose": "Define string constants used as tags for Celery task and job management in a Dagster integration.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments to variables",
  "sinks": "No data is processed from untrusted sources or passed to sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only static string assignments",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward variable assignments of string constants used as tags in Celery/Dagster context. There are no input sources, no data manipulation, no execution of dynamic code, and no communication with external systems. The constants are explicitly defined and serve as identifiers for task priorities, queues, and task IDs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as configuration constants for a Celery-Dagster integration. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks present.",
