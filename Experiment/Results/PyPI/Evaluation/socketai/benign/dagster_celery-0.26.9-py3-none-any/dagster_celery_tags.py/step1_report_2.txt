  "purpose": "Define string constants used as tags for Celery task prioritization, queue selection, and run monitoring within a Dagster workflow.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, no input reading or data processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code simply defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated structures present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting solely of string constant assignments related to Celery task management in a Dagster context. There are no inputs, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior or hidden code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines string constants for tagging Celery tasks in a workflow management system. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be benign configuration code.",
