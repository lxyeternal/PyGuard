  "purpose": "Implement a Dagster run launcher that schedules and manages Celery tasks for executing and resuming runs.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters (broker, backend, include, default_queue, config_source), environment variables (DAGSTER_CELERY_BROKER_HOST), run tags (DAGSTER_CELERY_TASK_ID_TAG, DAGSTER_CELERY_RUN_PRIORITY_TAG), user input through configuration, run and task data (run_id, task_id, tags, status).",
  "sinks": "Applying async tasks via Celery (`apply_async`), revoking tasks (`result.revoke`), reporting engine events and tags, and fetching task status and worker info.",
  "flows": "Configuration data → Celery app setup → Launch run (pack and send task) → Store task ID in run tags → Check task status (state) → Revoke task if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. Use of environment variable in description, but not directly in code. No suspicious code execution or obfuscation. All interactions seem to be standard Celery task management and status querying. No hidden or unusual data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Celery-based launcher for running Dagster jobs, with configuration handling, task creation, and monitoring. It uses safe pattern of packing arguments and applying tasks asynchronously. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data leaks. The only potential concern is environment variable in a string description, but it is a display string, not an execution or configuration variable. Task revocation, status checking, and reporting are standard operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious code activity. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a Celery task launcher for orchestrating Dagster runs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Celery-based run launcher for Dagster with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It manages tasks, checks status, and handles run lifecycle events securely and transparently. No indicators of malware or security risks were found.",
