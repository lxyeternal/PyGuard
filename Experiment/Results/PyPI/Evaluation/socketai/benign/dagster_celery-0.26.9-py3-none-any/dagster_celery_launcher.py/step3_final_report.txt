{
  "purpose": "A Dagster run launcher that manages execution, resumption, termination, and health checks of runs via Celery tasks, facilitating distributed execution and monitoring.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters (broker, backend, include, environment variables in docstrings), run tags (task IDs, priorities, queues), and input data from Dagster run objects.",
  "sinks": "Celery task scheduling via apply_async, status retrieval through AsyncResult, updating run tags with task IDs, and reporting engine events and debug info.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and run data flow into task creation functions, which serialize arguments with pack_value, then invoke apply_async with routing and priority. Status checks retrieve task states via AsyncResult, and run tags are updated with task IDs for tracking.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. Environment variables are only referenced in descriptive strings, not in executable code. No unusual dynamic code execution or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard pattern for integrating Dagster with Celery, utilizing Celery APIs for task management, status monitoring, and termination. It serializes execution arguments securely, manages run tags for tracking, and reports engine events appropriately. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The configuration relies on environment variables and user inputs, which are handled safely. The overall structure is clear, maintainable, and aligns with best practices for such orchestration components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Dagster-Celery run launcher with no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified given its operational nature. It can be considered safe for deployment in production environments.",
