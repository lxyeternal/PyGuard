  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Dagster-Celery run launcher with no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified given its operational nature. It can be considered safe for deployment in production environments."
