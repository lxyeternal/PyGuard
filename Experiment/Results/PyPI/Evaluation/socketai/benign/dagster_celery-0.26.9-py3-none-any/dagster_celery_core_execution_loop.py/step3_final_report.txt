{
  "purpose": "Implements a Celery-based execution loop for Dagster, managing task submission, progress monitoring, error handling, and revocation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, step tags, context, execution plan, and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Event emission, logs, deserialization of step events, and task results.",
  "flows": "From context and plan into task submission, then back via results, errors, and event handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard distributed task orchestrator using Celery, with proper exception handling, priority calculation, and event logging. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or data leaks are present. Deserialization is used in a typical manner. The code relies on external libraries in a standard way. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a Celery executor for Dagster, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
