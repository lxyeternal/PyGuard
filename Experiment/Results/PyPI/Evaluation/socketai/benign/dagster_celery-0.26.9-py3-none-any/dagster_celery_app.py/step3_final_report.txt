  "purpose": "This code initializes a Celery application with Dagster integration and defines task objects for execution.",
  "sources": "Imports from dagster_celery modules, app creation via make_app()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no external network or file operations",
  "flows": "Creation of app and task objects without external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for Celery with Dagster, importing functions, creating an app, and defining task variables. It does not process external input, handle untrusted data, or perform network operations. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling indicate a benign configuration component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for Celery tasks in a Dagster environment. There is no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, risk score approximately 0 to 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
