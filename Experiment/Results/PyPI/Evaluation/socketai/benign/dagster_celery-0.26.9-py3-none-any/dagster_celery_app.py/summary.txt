  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for Celery tasks in a Dagster environment. There is no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, risk score approximately 0 to 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."
