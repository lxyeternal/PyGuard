{
  "purpose": "Set up a Celery application with specific tasks for execution and resumption, used as a target for CLI commands.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dagster_celery.make_app' and 'dagster_celery.tasks'; function calls to create tasks and app.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> creating app -> creating tasks from app -> assigning tasks to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and primarily involves setting up Celery tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary functions to create a Celery app and associated tasks. It then initializes the app with make_app() and creates task instances tied to this app. There are no input/output operations, network communications, or data manipulations that could indicate malicious activity. The purpose appears to be setting up tasks for a Celery worker in a deployment environment. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for Celery tasks using the 'dagster_celery' package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
