{
  "purpose": "This code configures and creates a Celery application for task processing in a Dagster environment.",
  "sources": "Configuration objects (possibly external or user-provided), module imports, environment checks, and task route definitions.",
  "targets": "Module imports, configuration updates, and task queue setup.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters are used to set up Celery app and routes, with potential dynamic imports based on module availability.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic module import with 'force_mapping' and conditional configuration loading; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; reliance on external modules and environment states.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Celery app with specified task routes and optional configuration overrides. It conditionally loads configurations based on module availability and updates the app's configuration. The dynamic import via 'force_mapping' could be a point of concern, but it appears to be for configuration purposes only. There is no indication of malicious payload, network activity, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard setup logic for a task queue system with external configuration dependencies. No suspicious or malicious behavior was observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily serves as a configuration setup for Celery with dynamic configuration loading. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flows. It is a typical application setup script with external configuration dependencies, not inherently malicious.",
