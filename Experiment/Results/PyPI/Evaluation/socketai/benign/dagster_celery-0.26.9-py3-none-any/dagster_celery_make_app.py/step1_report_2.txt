  "purpose": "Set up a Celery application with specific task routes and configurations for the Dagster data orchestration framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'celery', 'dagster_shared', 'kombu', and 'dagster_celery.config'; usage of 'is_module_available', 'force_mapping', and dynamic module import; configuration parameters such as task queues and routes.",
  "sinks": "Configuration updates to the Celery app object; dynamic import of 'dagster_celery_config'; potential loading of external modules or configurations.",
  "flows": "Imports and checks for module availability -> creation of Celery app -> configuration loading -> dynamic module import -> setting task queues and routes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'force_mapping' for dynamic configuration loading; dynamic import with '_smart_import'; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; configuration appears standard; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to create and configure a Celery application with specific task routes for Dagster operations. It conditionally loads configurations from modules if available and sets up queues with priorities. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns are present. The dynamic import via '_smart_import' is a standard pattern for flexible configuration loading. No obfuscated or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to perform legitimate configuration and setup tasks for distributed task management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for Celery within the Dagster ecosystem, with dynamic configuration loading and queue setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for normal operation.",
