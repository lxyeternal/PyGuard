  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration setup with dynamic features that could pose security risks if external modules are untrusted. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2-0.3) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Ensuring the integrity of imported modules and avoiding testing modules in production would mitigate potential risks."
