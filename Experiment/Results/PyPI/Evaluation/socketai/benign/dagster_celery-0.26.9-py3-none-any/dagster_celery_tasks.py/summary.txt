  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for managing Dagster pipeline runs via Celery, with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate; the inert _send_to_null function is harmless in this context. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and standard for its purpose."
