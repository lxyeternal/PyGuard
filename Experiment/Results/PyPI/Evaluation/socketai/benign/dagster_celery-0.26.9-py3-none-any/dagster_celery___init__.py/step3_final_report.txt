{
  "purpose": "Register the 'dagster-celery' library version and expose the 'celery_executor' component for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dagster_shared.libraries', 'dagster_celery.executor', and 'dagster_celery.version'; the version string __version__ as input data.",
  "sinks": "The registration call 'DagsterLibraryRegistry.register' which records the library name and version; no other data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "The version string __version__ flows from the imported module into the registration function; no other data flows or external interactions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; the code is straightforward and standard for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import, registers a library version with a registry, and exposes an executor component. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or data leaks. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and very low security risk scores. The code aligns with typical package setup practices and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of external data handling or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module registration and export pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
