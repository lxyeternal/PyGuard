{
  "purpose": "This code appears to register a library component ('dagster-celery') with a registry system for use within a larger application, and exposes 'celery_executor' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dagster_shared.libraries', 'dagster_celery.executor', and 'dagster_celery.version'. The registration call to 'DagsterLibraryRegistry.register'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used; no output or network interactions or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static, and the registration call is straightforward, with no dynamic or untrusted data flow. No source-to-sink data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports modules, registers a library version with a registry, and exposes an executor component. All actions are standard initialization tasks. No external data inputs, no code execution based on untrusted inputs, and no network or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python package component, with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It performs straightforward registration and exports a function. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
