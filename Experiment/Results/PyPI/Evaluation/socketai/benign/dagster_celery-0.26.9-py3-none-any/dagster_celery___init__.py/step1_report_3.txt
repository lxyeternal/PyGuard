{
  "purpose": "The code registers a Dagster library ('dagster-celery') with its version and exposes the 'celery_executor' for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dagster_shared.libraries', 'dagster_celery.executor', and 'dagster_celery.version'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output actions present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; registration and export are straightforward assignments without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific modules related to Dagster and registers a library with a version number, then exports a list containing 'celery_executor'. All operations are static and standard for module setup. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup for a Dagster library, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
