{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules and registers a library version for the 'dagster-celery' package, then exports the 'celery_executor'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules: 'dagster_shared.libraries', 'dagster_celery.executor', and 'dagster_celery.version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, registers a version, and exposes 'celery_executor' without any data flow from external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing necessary components, registering a library with a version, and defining exports. There is no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data leakage. The import statements are standard, and registration appears to be part of normal package setup. No external inputs or outputs are involved that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard module imports and registration without any malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a typical setup file for a Python package.",
