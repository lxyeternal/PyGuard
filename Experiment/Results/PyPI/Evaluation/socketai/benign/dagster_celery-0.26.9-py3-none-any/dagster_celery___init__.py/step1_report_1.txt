{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that registers the 'dagster-celery' library version with a shared registry and exposes the 'celery_executor' for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dagster_shared.libraries', 'dagster_celery.executor', and 'dagster_celery.version'. No direct input or external data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present. The code only performs registration and exports a variable.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only registers a library and exposes an import.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The registration and import pattern are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules from well-known package structures, registers a library version in a registry, and defines an export. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. It is a typical module setup for a Python package component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard registration and export functions for a Python package component. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
