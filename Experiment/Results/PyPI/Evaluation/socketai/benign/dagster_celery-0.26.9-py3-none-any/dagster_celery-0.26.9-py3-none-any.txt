      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Dagster-Celery run launcher with no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified given its operational nature. It can be considered safe for deployment in production environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for managing Celery workers with no malicious intent. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.2–0.4. The main security consideration is ensuring proper validation and sanitization of YAML inputs to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for managing Dagster pipeline runs via Celery, with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate; the inert _send_to_null function is harmless in this context. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and standard for its purpose."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration setup with dynamic features that could pose security risks if external modules are untrusted. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2-0.3) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Ensuring the integrity of imported modules and avoiding testing modules in production would mitigate potential risks."

Environment variables are only referenced in documentation strings, and the task dispatching process is standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with a safe, production-ready component."
