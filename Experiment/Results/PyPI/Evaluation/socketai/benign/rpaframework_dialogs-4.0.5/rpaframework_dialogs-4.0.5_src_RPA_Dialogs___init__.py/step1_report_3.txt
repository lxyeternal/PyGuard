{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing modules or classes related to dialog management from the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions present; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input, or output are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with straightforward import statements; no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing 'Dialog' and 'Dialogs' from local modules. These imports do not involve any data processing, network activity, or other behavior that could be malicious. Since the code is minimal and only imports modules, there are no indicators of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are visible. It is a typical pattern for Python package structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple module imports with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
