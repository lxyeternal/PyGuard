  "sources": "None; only import statements, no data input or external data sources",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flows; import statements only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard import statements with relative paths",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing classes from sibling modules within the same package. There is no execution of code, no data handling, and no suspicious or unusual patterns. It appears to be a typical module import setup with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and only involves importing classes from local modules. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
