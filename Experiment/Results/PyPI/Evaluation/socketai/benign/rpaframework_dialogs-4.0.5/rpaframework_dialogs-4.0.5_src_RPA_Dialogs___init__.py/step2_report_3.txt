  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** Only import statements; no data processing, network calls, or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is benign.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; only local module imports with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; benign.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—simple local imports with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; benign.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, just import statements, no data flow or malicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; benign.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar import statements; a minimal securityRisk score of 0.1 is assigned.  \n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 is somewhat arbitrary given the absence of any suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — seems slightly overestimated, but not unreasonable if conservative.  \n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is only import statements with no malicious activity.  \n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports, as no malicious behavior is present.  \n- The obfuscated scores are correctly 0, as the code is straightforward.  \n- The securityRisk scores are mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is acceptable but could be more precise.  \n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the code is purely import statements, **all scores should be 0** for malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk, unless there's a specific reason to assign a minimal risk score.  \n- The one report with a 0.1 security risk should be adjusted to 0 for consistency, unless the scoring system intentionally assigns a minimal risk for any code snippet, which is not justified here.  \n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports — code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 for all reports — no security risks present.  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nGiven the minimal and benign nature of the code snippets, **my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the analysis that these are standard import statements with no malicious or suspicious activity.",
