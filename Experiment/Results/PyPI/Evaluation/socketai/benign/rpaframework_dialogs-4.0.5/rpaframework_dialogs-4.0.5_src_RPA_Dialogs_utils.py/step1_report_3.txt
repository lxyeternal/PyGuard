  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing options, converting values, and identifying element types in a UI/dialog context.",
  "sources": "Function parameters and imported modules (typing, RPA.core.types, dialog_types). No user input handling present.",
  "sinks": "None; functions perform data transformation, validation, and type checks without external output or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "N/A; no untrusted data flows from source to sink; functions are purely processing and validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code contains helper functions for converting and validating data, specifically options and element types. It uses safe practices like type checking, exception handling, and input validation. No external data is fetched, sent, or manipulated maliciously. The code appears to serve legitimate utility functions for dialog handling within a larger application. No signs of malware, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears benign, performing standard data validation and conversion routines with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
