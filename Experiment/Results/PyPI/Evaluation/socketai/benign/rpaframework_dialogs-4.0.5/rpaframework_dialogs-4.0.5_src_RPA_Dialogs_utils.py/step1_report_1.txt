  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing options, type conversions, and element type checks in a UI/dialog context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as opts, val, and element dicts.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated and converted within functions; no external data flow or untrusted data handling beyond basic input validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for converting options and types, and for checking element types. It handles input validation with exceptions but does not perform any external communication, data exfiltration, or security-sensitive operations. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or covert behavior. All data handling appears safe and within expected boundaries for a UI utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is standard utility code for data processing within a dialog/UI context. No security risks are present based on the provided code.",
