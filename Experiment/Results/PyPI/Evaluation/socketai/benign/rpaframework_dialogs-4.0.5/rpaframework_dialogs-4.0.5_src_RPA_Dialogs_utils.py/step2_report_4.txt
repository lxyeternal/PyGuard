  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is utility functions for options processing, type conversions, and element type checks.\n- No external system interactions, data exfiltration, or suspicious code patterns are noted.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are observed.\n- The code appears straightforward, with proper validation and exception handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for options, type conversions, element checks.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, benign, standard utility code.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the benign nature. The malware score is correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no external data flow.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The zero scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behaviors, safe practices.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for options and element checks.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no external communication.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for options, type checks.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is purely utility functions with no external communication, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. **Malware score should remain 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation or code complexity that suggests hiding malicious intent. **Obfuscated score should be 0.**\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, the overall security risk remains very low. The only minor point is the default risk score of 0.1 in Report 1, which is reasonable but perhaps slightly high for such utility code. I would suggest a **risk score of 0.0** for all reports, reflecting no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Based on the code and reports, my final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (benign utility functions)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.**",
