  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing options, type conversions, and element checks in a dialog framework.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, imported modules, and element dictionary objects",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or system modifications",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through type conversion functions with validation, with no external data sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for handling options and type conversions with validation. It uses external functions (is_list_like) for type checking, and performs simple data manipulations. No suspicious data handling or network activity is present. No potential security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for dialog handling without malicious intent or security issues.",
