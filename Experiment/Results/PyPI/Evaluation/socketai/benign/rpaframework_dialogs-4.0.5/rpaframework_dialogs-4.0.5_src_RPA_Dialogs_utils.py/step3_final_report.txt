  "purpose": "Utility functions for options processing, type conversions, and element type checks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'opts', 'val', and 'element' attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; functions perform local validation and conversions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation and conversion functions, with no external or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with clear validation and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple, safe utility functions performing data validation, type conversions, and element attribute checks. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The functions rely on external 'is_list_like' but this is a standard utility. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is benign and serves UI/dialog purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The functions are straightforward, safe, and appropriate for their utility role. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1 (or lower), reflecting minimal security concern. The assessments in the provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code.",
