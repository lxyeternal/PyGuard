  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, data flows, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a dialog management library for Robot Framework, with inputs mainly from function parameters and internal class attributes. No external untrusted data sources like network inputs are evident.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The code primarily creates UI elements, logs information, and manages dialog lifecycle. No data is sent externally or executed dynamically.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or secret handling. The code is straightforward, with validation to prevent duplicate or reserved input names.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** It appears to be a legitimate UI library with no malicious intent. Confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, and security risk is minimal (0.1).\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is safe and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with input sources from method parameters and internal file pattern matching via `glob.glob`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dialog results and user inputs are handled securely; no network or file system sabotage is evident.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or external code execution. Logging and resource cleanup are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a standard dialog management system, with no signs of malicious behavior. Confidence is absolute (1.0), malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Completely safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on dialog creation with user inputs, with data coming from method parameters and internal validation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** User inputs are captured and returned; no external or malicious data flows are detected.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious external interactions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard implementation. Malware score is 0, confidence high (~0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar dialog management functions, with input parameters and user interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are primarily UI interactions; no network or file system sabotage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code patterns. Proper validation and resource cleanup.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, safe code. Malware score 0, confidence ~0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, dialog creation with user inputs, files, and environment data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** User inputs flow into result objects; no external data exfiltration or malicious operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard dialog library. Malware score 0, confidence ~0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** No security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's content.\n- **Obfuscated:** None of the reports mention obfuscation; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are very low (~0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security risk, mainly due to user input handling.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed review, **the code is a legitimate, well-structured dialog management library for Robot Framework**. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The data flows are controlled, and no external or untrusted data is mishandled.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, mainly due to user input handling)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
