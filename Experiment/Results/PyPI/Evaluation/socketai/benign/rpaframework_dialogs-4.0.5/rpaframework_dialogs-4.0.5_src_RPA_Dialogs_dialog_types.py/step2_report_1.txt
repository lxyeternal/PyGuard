  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims made about the code.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is purely definitional, establishing type aliases and enums for UI elements.\n- It contains no functions, data processing, external input, or output.\n- The enums Size and Icon are straightforward, with string values representing options.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code is standard and intended for configuration or UI purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is static, purely definitional, and free of malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The code is simple and correct.\n\n- **Scores assigned by reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  Since the code is benign, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No claims are made about vulnerabilities; all reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nIf any future reports suggest malicious activity or obfuscation, re-evaluation would be necessary. For now, the code is safe and well-understood.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- No changes needed to the reports' assessments.",
