  "purpose": "Define type aliases and enumerations for elements, options, and results, likely for a UI or configuration system.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks, untrusted data handling, or output affecting external systems are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines type aliases for data structures. It then defines two enumerations, Size and Icon, each with descriptive string values. There are no functions, no data input/output handling, and no operations that could be exploited or malicious. Overall, this appears to be standard, benign code intended for defining constants and types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign definition of enums and type aliases with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior.",
