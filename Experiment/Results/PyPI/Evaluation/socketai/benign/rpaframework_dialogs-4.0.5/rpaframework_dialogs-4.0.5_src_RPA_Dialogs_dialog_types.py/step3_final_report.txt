  "purpose": "Define UI element options and types using enums and type aliases for a Python application.",
  "sources": "Import statements, enum class definitions (Size, Icon), type alias declarations (Element, Elements, Options, Result).",
  "sinks": "None; code is purely definitional with no data input/output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, enum classes for size and icon options, and type aliases for elements and results. It is static, with no functions, data processing, or external data handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The enums assign simple string values, typical for configuration purposes. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and purely definitional. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the code's nature. No logical errors or security concerns are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity support a conclusion of no malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module defining enums and type aliases for UI elements. All assessments are accurate; the code poses no security threat or malicious behavior. The scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
