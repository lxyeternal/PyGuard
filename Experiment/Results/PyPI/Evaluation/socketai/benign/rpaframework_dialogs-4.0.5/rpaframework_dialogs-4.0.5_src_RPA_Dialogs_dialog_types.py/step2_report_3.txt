  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements, enum class definitions, and type aliases.\n- No functions, data processing, external inputs, or outputs are present.\n- The enums define string constants for UI element sizes and icon types.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign configuration or type definition module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code itself. All reports correctly identify the code as purely definitional with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **In the reports:** No errors or flaws are noted; all reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- **In the code:** No errors or flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n- These scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- **Malware score (0):** The code contains no malicious activity or code, so 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk (0):** No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or risky behavior are present.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is purely definitional, which aligns with the actual content.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made, which is correct given the code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**This code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n- The code is a standard, safe set of enum and type alias definitions for UI configuration.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep the scores as is: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- Confirm that this code remains purely definitional and free of hidden malicious behavior.",
