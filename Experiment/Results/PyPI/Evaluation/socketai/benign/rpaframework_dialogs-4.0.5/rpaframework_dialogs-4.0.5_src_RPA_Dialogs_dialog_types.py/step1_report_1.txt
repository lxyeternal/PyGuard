  "purpose": "Define type aliases and enumerations for UI elements and options",
  "sources": "Import statements and class definitions (Enum and typing imports, class attributes)",
  "sinks": "None present; code primarily defines enums and type aliases",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely definitional",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines two Enum classes, Size and Icon, representing element sizes and icon variants respectively. It also defines several type aliases for data structures like Element, Elements, Options, and Result. The code is straightforward and intended for UI or configuration purposes. There are no functions, user inputs, or external data reads, and no suspicious or malicious activity is embedded within these definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up enums and type aliases for use elsewhere. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
