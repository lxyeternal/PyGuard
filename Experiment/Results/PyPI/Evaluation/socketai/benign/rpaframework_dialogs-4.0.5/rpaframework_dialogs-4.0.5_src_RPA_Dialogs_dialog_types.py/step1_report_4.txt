{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases and enumerations for UI element sizes and icons, likely for a configuration or data representation system.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'enum' and 'typing' modules; defines enums and type aliases.",
  "targets": "No specific sinks present; code primarily sets up constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum and type alias definitions for organizing UI-related options. It imports standard modules and creates named constants for sizes and icon variants. There are no input operations, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of sensitive data. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, serving as a simple, well-structured set of constants and types for UI configuration. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
