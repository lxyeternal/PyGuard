  "purpose": "Define data type aliases and enumerations for UI elements or configuration options.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code only defines classes and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares data structures and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Enum classes, Size and Icon, to categorize element sizes and icon types. It also establishes type aliases for various data structures. There are no input/output operations, no external data reading, and no execution flow that could be exploited. The code appears to be purely structural, serving as part of a larger application. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious definition of enums and type aliases intended for UI or configuration purposes. It poses no security threat or malware risk.",
