  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code provided.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines two Enum classes (`Size` and `Icon`) with string values.\n- It establishes several type aliases (`Element`, `Elements`, `Options`, `Result`) using `typing`.\n- The code is purely definitional; no functions, data processing, or external input/output are present.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns. They are consistent with the code's actual content.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no data flow, no external inputs, and no malicious activity. No logical errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk)?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0  \n  These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk scores (if any):**  \n  Since all scores are zero, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly state that the code is purely structural with no external data handling or dynamic behavior.\n\n- **Is there any inconsistency?**  \n  No. The assessments are consistent and aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Justification:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the consensus among reports, I concur with their assessments. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, purely definitional, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
