{
  "purpose": "Define detailed Python type annotations for AWS Omics service data structures, request, and response types.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions and type annotations from the import statements, and defines TypedDict and Union structures directly within the code.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that process untrusted external data or execute untrusted code. No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is present.",
  "flows": "The code solely consists of type definitions and static annotations without any executable logic, data flow, or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. It is a comprehensive set of type annotations and data structures for a SDK.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and third-party typing extensions to define precise data structures for AWS Omics. It uses type annotations and TypedDict to specify expected request and response formats. There are no dynamic executions, evals, or data transformations. No external input handling, no network calls, and no code injection mechanisms are present. The structure is static and solely for type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a purely static, type annotation module for AWS Omics SDKs. It does not execute any logic or handle external data, eliminating the risk of malicious behavior. It is designed to facilitate type safety and code clarity, with no indications of malicious intent or security threats.",
