{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations and TypedDict definitions for AWS Omics SDK request and response schemas, serving as data validation and SDK development aids.",
  "sources": "No runtime data sources; only static type definitions and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; purely declarative type schemas without data processing or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static definitions do not process or transfer data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with conditional imports for compatibility, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDict schemas, constants, and import statements. It employs conditional imports for Python version compatibility and defines data schemas for API requests and responses. There are no runtime behaviors, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The purpose is to facilitate static type checking, validation, and SDK code generation. The code is syntactically correct, logically consistent, and adheres to best practices for type hinting. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations for an SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated content. It serves purely as data schemas for API validation and SDK development, posing no security risks.",
