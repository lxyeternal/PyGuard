{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Omics service API requests and responses, primarily used for data validation and code generation.",
  "sources": "Constant import statements, type alias definitions, and data structure declarations; no input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications are present; the code only defines data types and structures.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows or execution paths; all code consists of static type definitions without dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors; no obfuscated or unusual code patterns. The code strictly defines type annotations and data schemas.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive collection of Python TypedDict and type alias definitions used for AWS SDK (boto3) type stubs for the Omics service. It employs conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions and adheres to standard type hinting practices. There are no indications of malicious code, such as code injection, network activity, or backdoors. The structure is purely declarative, serving as type hints and validation schemas for API communication. The absence of runtime logic, external system calls, or dynamic code execution minimizes risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, static declaration of data types for use in a Python SDK. It shows no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code's purpose is to facilitate static type checking and code completion, not to perform any runtime operations or malicious activities.",
