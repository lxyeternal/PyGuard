  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n- It reads command-line arguments to decide what to output.\n- It writes output directly to stdout.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code.\n- No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or signs of malware.\n- The code appears benign and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is benign, simple, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Issues in reasoning:** None identified. The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent; no adjustments needed.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code is purely informational, with no external dependencies, no dynamic behavior, and no suspicious patterns, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at **0**.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code is straightforward.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or malicious.\n\n---\n\n## Final Assessment:\n\n| Score Type        | Recommended Value | Justification                                               |\n|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                   | No malicious activity detected; static info only.           |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                   | Code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation.          |\n| Security Risk     | 0                   | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors present.             |\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, benign CLI utility that displays static package information and version details. Based on the provided reports and analysis, **all scores should remain at 0** for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No further action needed. The code is safe and poses no security threat.",
