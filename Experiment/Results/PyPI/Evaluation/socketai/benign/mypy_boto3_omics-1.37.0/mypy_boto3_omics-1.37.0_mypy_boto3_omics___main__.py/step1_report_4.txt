  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "User runs the script -> script reads sys.argv -> if '--version' present, outputs version -> else outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward command-line interface that displays static package information or version details. It reads input from sys.argv to determine which info to display and writes output directly to stdout. There are no external network connections, no data exfiltration, and no code injection mechanisms present. The code uses simple conditional logic without any complex or malicious constructs. No anomalies such as embedded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely provides static package info and version output without any suspicious behavior.",
