  "purpose": "CLI entry point for a package providing information about boto3 Omics 1.37.0, including printing package info and version.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments via sys.argv, reading from stdout via sys.stdout.write",
  "sinks": "Writing to stdout via sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() which writes version info to stdout; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. No external network access, file operations, or environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The script provides CLI functionality to display package information and version. It reads command-line arguments and outputs static strings. There are no external data sources, no network activity, and no code execution or dynamic behavior. The code is straightforward, with standard library usage and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package info and version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
