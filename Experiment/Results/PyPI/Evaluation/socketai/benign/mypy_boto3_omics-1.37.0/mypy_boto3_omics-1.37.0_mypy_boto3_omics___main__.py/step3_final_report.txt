  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) to stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that checks for '--version' argument and prints either version info or package details. It uses sys.argv for input and sys.stdout.write for output. No external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or secrets are present. All reports agree on its benign nature. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
