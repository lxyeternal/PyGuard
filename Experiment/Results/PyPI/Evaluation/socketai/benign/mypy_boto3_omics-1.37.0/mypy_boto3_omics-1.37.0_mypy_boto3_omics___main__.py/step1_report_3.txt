  "purpose": "Provide CLI interface to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input arguments, sys.stdout for output display.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write() for displaying information.",
  "flows": "User input (--version) triggers print_version() -> outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI tool that prints package info or version based on user input. It reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and outputs to stdout. No untrusted data sources, no network activity, nor suspicious behavior observed. The code is clean, simple, and performs only informational output without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed solely for displaying static package information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
