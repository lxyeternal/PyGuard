  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`).\n- If `--version` is present, it outputs the version (`1.37.0`).\n- Otherwise, it outputs static package info (about boto3 Omics 1.37.0).\n- It writes all output to `sys.stdout`.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or security risks detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, static, and benign.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The logic is sound, and the implementation is simple and correct.\n\n- **Scores given (malware, obfuscated, security risk)?**  \n  All reports assign 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of the reports:\n- All reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no malware.  \n- They correctly identify the script as a simple CLI utility that outputs static information based on command-line input.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities or malicious intent, which aligns with the code.\n- The only point of potential concern would be if the code had hidden malicious behavior, but it does not.\n\n### Malware and risk scoring:\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk score is 0, also appropriate.\n- Obfuscation is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, safe CLI utility with no signs of supply chain or security issues. The existing scores are justified and should remain as-is.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways remain vigilant for future changes or hidden behaviors, but based on this static analysis, the code is safe.",
