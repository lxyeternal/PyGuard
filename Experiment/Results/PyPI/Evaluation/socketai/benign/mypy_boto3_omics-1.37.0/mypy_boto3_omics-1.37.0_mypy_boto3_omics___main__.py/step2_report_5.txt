  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe provided code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line input. It reads `sys.argv` to check for the `--version` flag and writes predefined strings to `stdout`. The code contains no external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:**  \n  - No issues are present; the code is straightforward and benign.\n- **Malware presence:**  \n  - No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  - No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risks:**  \n  - None apparent; the code performs simple static output.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \n- All describe the code as a simple, benign CLI utility that outputs static package info and version based on command-line arguments.  \n- They correctly identify no suspicious behaviors, no external data sources, no network activity, and no malicious intent.  \n- The confidence scores are all 1, and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**  \n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.  \n- No report suggests any suspicious or malicious activity, nor do they assume any vulnerabilities beyond the benign behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  - Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  - Should remain at **0**, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:**  \n  - Given the above, the overall security risk should be **0**.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code is purely informational, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors, code injection, or secret leaks.\n- The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \n- No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.  \n- The code is static, simple, and benign.  \n- No external dependencies or network activity.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a straightforward CLI utility with no security concerns. The scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and security risk categories.",
