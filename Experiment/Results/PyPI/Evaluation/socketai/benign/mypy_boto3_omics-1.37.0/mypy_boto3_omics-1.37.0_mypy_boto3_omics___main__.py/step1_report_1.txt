  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static information. It only reads command-line arguments and writes predefined strings to standard output. No external data sources, environment variables, or network operations are involved. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns detected. It appears to be a benign utility for displaying package info and version details.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to display static package information and version. No signs of malware or security vulnerabilities are present.",
