  "purpose": "CLI entry point for a package that outputs package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; reads standard output streams.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) to print_version function, then stdout to display package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code; no network connections or system modifications; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script serves as a simple CLI interface to display static package information and version details. It reads command-line input to decide whether to display version info or package details. All data is static or derived from command-line arguments. There are no sources or sinks that lead to data leaks, code injection, or malicious activity. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs simple output operations based on user input, with no external data handling or system tampering.",
