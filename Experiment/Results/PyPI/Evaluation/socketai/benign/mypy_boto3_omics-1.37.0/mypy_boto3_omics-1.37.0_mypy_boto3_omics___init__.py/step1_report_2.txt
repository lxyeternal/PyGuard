{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports classes and functions related to the Omics service SDK, including client, waiters, and paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter). No external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly class and function definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation detected. The copyright date appears inconsistent with the code (2025), but this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and defining an API interface for the Omics service SDK. It imports various waiters, paginators, and the client class, then assigns the client class to a generic name and exposes all components via __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, external input handling, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a straightforward SDK interface module with no malicious or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK module setup with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. It does not handle external input or perform any data processing that could be exploited. Overall, it appears safe.",
