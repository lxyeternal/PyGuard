{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports classes and types for interacting with the AWS Omics service, including waiters, paginators, and the client.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter). No external input or data reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or inputs. No network communication, data leaks, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines and exports classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The license line contains a typo ('Youtype' instead of 'YouType'), but this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes from local files and re-exports them as part of the public API. There are no data processing, network activities, or security-sensitive operations. The presence of licensing and documentation comments is standard. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly serving as a centralized import/export module for AWS Omics SDK components. No malicious intent or security threats are evident.",
