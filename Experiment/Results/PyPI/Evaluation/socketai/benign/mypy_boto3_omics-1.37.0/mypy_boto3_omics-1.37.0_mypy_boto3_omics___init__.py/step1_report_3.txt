{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface for the Omics service SDK, providing imports and type annotations for various waiters, paginators, and the client class.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter), which are presumably part of the SDK package.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data; it mainly provides class and function imports for SDK usage. No untrusted data handling or network effects are directly visible.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing SDK components and assigning the OmicsClient class to a variable, with no dynamic or runtime data flows evident within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are observed. The code is straightforward, mainly consisting of imports, constants, and assignments. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK interface setup, importing various SDK components from internal modules and assigning the main client class. There are no indications of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network communications outside SDK calls, or backdoors. All imports and assignments appear standard and consistent with SDK boilerplate. The presence of extensive imports might suggest a large SDK package, but no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK interface module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions to facilitate the use of the Omics service SDK components and does not exhibit malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
