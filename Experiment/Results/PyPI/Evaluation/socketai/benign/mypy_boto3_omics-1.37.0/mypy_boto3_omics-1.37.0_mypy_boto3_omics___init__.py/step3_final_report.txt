{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for the AWS Omics SDK, importing waiters, paginators, and client classes, and re-exporting them for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules and string literals for service and method names.",
  "sinks": "No handling of untrusted data, no data leaks, no external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Static import and assignment statements; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which appears to be a typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module, consisting solely of import statements and variable assignments. There is no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The extensive list of imports and waiters suggests a comprehensive SDK setup. The only suspicious aspect is the future date, which is likely a typo and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a boilerplate SDK interface with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor typo in the copyright year does not impact security.",
