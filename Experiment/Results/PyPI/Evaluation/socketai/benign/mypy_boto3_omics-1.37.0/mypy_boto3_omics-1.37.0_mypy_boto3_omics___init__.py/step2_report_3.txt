  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether the scoring reflects the actual risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states the code provides an interface and imports for the AWS Omics SDK, mainly static import statements.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources, no network or data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, only standard imports. The copyright date is in 2025, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical SDK interface module, with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:**  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security concern) aligns well.  \n- **Malware:** 0, no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scoring are reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, standard imports from internal modules. No external inputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or network effects.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, apart from the copyright date (2025), which is likely a placeholder.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward SDK setup, no malicious code or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:**  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 is slightly above zero but justified only if considering the future date as an anomaly. However, the date alone doesn't constitute a security risk.  \n- **Malware:** 0, no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score could be lowered to 0, as there's no real security concern. The malware score remains appropriate at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—imports from SDK modules, no external data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or network calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, aside from the future date again.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK interface code, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:**  \n- **Risk:** 0, appropriate.  \n- **Malware:** 0, no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Imports from local modules, no external inputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, aside from the typo in the license comment (\"Youtype\" instead of \"YouType\"), which is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** A simple import/export module, standard SDK pattern.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:**  \n- **Risk:** 0, correct.  \n- **Malware:** 0, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others—imports from local modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, aside from the future date.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK setup, no malicious code.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:**  \n- **Risk:** 0, justified.  \n- **Malware:** 0, no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is mainly import statements and variable assignments, with no dynamic code, data processing, or network activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0.\n- **Security Risk:** The only minor point is the future copyright date (2025), which is not a security concern but might be flagged as an anomaly. The reports appropriately do not consider it a security issue.\n- **Scores:** All are reasonable; the only minor adjustment could be lowering the security risk in report 2 to 0, given the lack of any real security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or data leaks)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK interface module with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate in their assessments and scoring, with only minor room for adjusting the security risk in report 2 to zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior. The current scoring accurately reflects this.",
