{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface and imports for the AWS Omics service SDK, including waiters, paginators, and client initialization.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and hardcoded string literals for service and method names.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data; no code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present within this code.",
  "flows": "N/A - mainly import and initialization statements with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected. The code consists of straightforward imports and variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package module that imports classes and functions from internal modules to expose an SDK interface. All the imports are standard and refer to well-defined SDK components like waiters and paginators. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The only notable aspect is the presence of a copyright date set in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior in the import statements or structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK interface module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply aggregates and exposes various SDK components for use elsewhere. There are no security concerns or malicious behaviors detected.",
