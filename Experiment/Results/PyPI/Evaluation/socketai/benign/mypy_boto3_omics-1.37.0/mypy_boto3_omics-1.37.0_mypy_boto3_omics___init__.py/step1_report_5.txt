{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to interact with the AWS Omics service via a client and associated waiters and paginators, facilitating API calls and resource management.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .client, .paginator, and .waiter; no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or output; the code mainly defines classes, imports, and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up class imports and assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; the code is structured as standard module imports and assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes and assigning constants related to AWS SDK's Omics client, waiters, and paginators. It does not process user input or external data. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious control flow are present. The copyright date is 2025, which is in the future but not inherently malicious. The structure and imports suggest a typical SDK wrapper or interface module without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface setup for AWS SDK interactions with the Omics service. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
