  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the script is a standard Python package setup script.\n- No untrusted data, external data processing, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are present.\n- The only minor anomaly noted is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future and likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward and aligns with typical setup scripts.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no malware, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **External interactions:** None; no external data input/output, network calls, or dynamic code.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None based on the static nature of the script.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low, with 0 for malware and security risk.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year \"2025,\" which could be a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't introduce security issues.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the script performs a benign, standard setup task.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n- The code's purpose and behavior are clear and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe script is a typical, safe package setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe analysis confirms that the code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated content, and the risk level is negligible. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
