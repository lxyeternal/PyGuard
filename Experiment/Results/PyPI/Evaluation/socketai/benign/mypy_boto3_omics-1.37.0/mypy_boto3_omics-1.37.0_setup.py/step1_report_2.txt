{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-omics', used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description, and uses static values for package configuration and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted input or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A — no untrusted data sources or data flows are present in this setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors. The code is straightforward and uses standard setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'Path' from pathlib and 'setup' from setuptools. It reads a markdown file for the long description, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. The setup parameters are static and well-formed. No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted data, and no suspicious patterns are present. All dependencies and URLs appear legitimate and related to the package purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It only performs package configuration tasks without external data input or output. Overall security risk is negligible.",
