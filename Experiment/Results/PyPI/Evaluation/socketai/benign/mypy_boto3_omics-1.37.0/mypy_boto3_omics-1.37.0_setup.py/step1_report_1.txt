  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package called 'mypy-boto3-omics', providing package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads static strings and package information; imports setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Reads local file content for description; uses static package data; no external data input or untrusted data processing flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward setup configuration without unusual constructs or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup script. It imports necessary modules, reads a local markdown file for the description, and calls 'setup()' with static and well-defined parameters. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is involved. All package metadata appears normal. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended for package distribution.",
