  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-omics', intended for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package metadata from the setup() arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or external system effects; no execution of external commands or data processing that involves untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A - No untrusted data flow; data is static and predefined, used solely for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard setup script with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a static README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file system manipulation beyond reading a local file. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script. All components follow typical patterns for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign and solely used for packaging a Python project. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
