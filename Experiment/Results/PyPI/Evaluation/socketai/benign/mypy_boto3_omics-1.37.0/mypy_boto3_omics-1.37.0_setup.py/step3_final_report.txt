  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-omics', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static strings for package info and URLs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external outputs, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to setup() parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year '2025' is in the future, likely a typo or placeholder, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. No external data input, network activity, or obfuscation detected. All signals indicate benign intent. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, consistent with the analysis.",
