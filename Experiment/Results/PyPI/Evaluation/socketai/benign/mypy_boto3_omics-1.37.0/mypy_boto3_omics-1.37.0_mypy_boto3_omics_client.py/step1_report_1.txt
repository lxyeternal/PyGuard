  "purpose": "Type annotations and method definitions for the OmicsClient to interact with the AWS Omics service, facilitating type-safe API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class definitions; method signatures; overloads for paginators and waiters.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as generate_presigned_url, abort_multipart_read_set_upload, accept_share, batch_delete_read_set, etc., which invoke external AWS API endpoints or generate URLs.",
  "flows": "Input data from method parameters (kwargs, Params, etc.) flowing into API calls; presigned URL generation involving untrusted Params; method return values; paginator and waiter creation flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. Use of standard AWS SDK patterns with extensive type annotations and overloads. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides detailed type annotations, overloads for paginators and waiters, and method signatures for AWS Omics SDK interactions. It includes imports, class definitions, property and method signatures, and extensive documentation referencing official AWS and boto3-stubs documentation. The structure and content are consistent with standard SDK design. No signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activities. The presigned URL and API call patterns are typical and do not exhibit suspicious flows. The code appears to be a well-structured, type-safe SDK interface without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation and SDK interface for AWS Omics. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. The extensive type hints and overloads support safe and predictable usage, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
