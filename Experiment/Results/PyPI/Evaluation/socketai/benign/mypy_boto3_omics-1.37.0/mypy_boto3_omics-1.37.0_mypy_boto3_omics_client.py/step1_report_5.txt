{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the boto3 Omics service, providing typed method signatures and paginator/waiter overloads.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions; overload decorators for get_paginator and get_waiter.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that return typed responses; no untrusted data handling; property and method signatures with type annotations; no execution of dynamic code or external commands.",
  "flows": "Imports and type annotations flow into class and method definitions; overloads define specific return types based on input strings; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic execution or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors detected. The code consists solely of type annotations, method signatures, and overloads. No suspicious code constructs or behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for AWS Omics with detailed type annotations, including overloads for method signatures and return types. It imports standard modules, botocore exceptions, and internal modules for request and response types. The structure is typical for a stub/interface layer intended for static type checking and IDE support. No code execution, data handling, or external interactions are implemented. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or sabotage mechanisms are evident. The code appears purely to facilitate type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive type-annotated interface for the boto3 Omics client. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is designed for static analysis, type safety, and IDE support. No suspicious or malicious signals are identified.",
