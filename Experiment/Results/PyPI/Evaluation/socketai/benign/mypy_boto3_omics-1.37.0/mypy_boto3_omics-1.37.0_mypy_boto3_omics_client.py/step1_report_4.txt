  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS Omics service, providing method signatures for API operations and paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard and third-party libraries, type definitions, and method signatures within the OmicsClient class.",
  "sinks": "Methods constructing API request parameters, returning responses, or creating paginators and waiters; no direct data sinks or untrusted data processing shown.",
  "flows": "Method calls with unpacked request data leading to API requests, responses returning data, and paginator/waiter factory methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. The code consists solely of type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class with type annotations, method signatures, and overloads for paginator and waiter creation, following standard boto3 stub patterns. There is no executable logic or data processing; it primarily provides static type hints. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are present. The code is consistent with SDK stub generation and type hinting practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard SDK stub definition for the AWS Omics service, focused on type annotations and method signatures. It does not contain malicious code or security risks. The structure and content are typical for auto-generated type hints, with no indications of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
