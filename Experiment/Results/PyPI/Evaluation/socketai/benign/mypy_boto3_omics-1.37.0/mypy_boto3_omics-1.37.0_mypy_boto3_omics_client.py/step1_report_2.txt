  "purpose": "Type annotations and method definitions for the boto3 Omics client to facilitate type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, third-party dependencies (botocore, sys), and local modules (.paginator, .type_defs, .waiter). No data input sources in the code itself.",
  "sinks": "Method signatures with parameters and return types; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Method definitions pass keyword arguments unpacked from type definitions to the underlying boto3 client; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive method definitions and overloads for paginators and waiters appears to be standard for boto3 stubs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code logic. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or covert data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a large set of type annotations, method signatures, and overloads for the AWS boto3 client for the Omics service. It imports necessary modules and defines a client class with methods mirroring the official SDK, including exception classes, paginator and waiter methods, and API call signatures. No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions suggest malicious intent. The pattern of code appears consistent with a type-annotated SDK stub meant to improve developer experience. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation and interface definition for the boto3 Omics client, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is purely declarative, supporting type checking and IDE features without executing or handling data in a suspicious manner.",
