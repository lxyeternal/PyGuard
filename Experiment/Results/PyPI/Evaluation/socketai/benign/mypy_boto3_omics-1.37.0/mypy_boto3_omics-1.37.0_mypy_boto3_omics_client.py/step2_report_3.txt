  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code content, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as type annotations and method signatures for AWS Omics SDK. Sources are mainly imports, class definitions, method signatures, overloads, and documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The code flows are limited to method signatures and type annotations; no data is processed at runtime.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard for SDK stubs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report concludes the code is benign, with high confidence (0.95). No malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a standard SDK stub with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, emphasizing type annotations and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources; the code is declarative.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of malicious activity; the extensive method signatures are typical for SDK interfaces.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Confirms benign nature with high confidence (0.9). No malware or sabotage.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior detected; the code is a type-safe SDK interface.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, focusing on static SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data handling or external data flows; purely type annotations.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code; consistent with SDK stub generation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, with maximum confidence (1.0). No security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a typical, safe SDK stub.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, emphasizing static type annotations and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow from untrusted sources; mainly method signatures and overloads.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, high confidence (0.95). No malware or sabotage.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a standard SDK interface with no malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; focus on static type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external interactions; purely static signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or sabotage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, with maximum confidence (1.0). No malware or security issues.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a well-structured, type-annotated SDK interface.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of type annotations, method signatures, overloads, and documentation links. No executable logic, data processing, or external network activity is present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports find any signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Security Risks:** The code is purely declarative, serving as a type stub for static analysis and IDE support.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate. Their confidence levels are high, reflecting the thorough analysis.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Final Justification:** The code is a comprehensive, well-structured SDK stub for AWS Omics, intended for static type checking. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or network activity that could pose security concerns. The extensive use of type annotations and overloads is standard practice for such SDKs.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as a type-safe interface for AWS SDK interactions, supporting static analysis and IDE features.",
