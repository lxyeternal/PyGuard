  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations defining string literals for AWS and Omics resource identifiers, statuses, and related constants. It contains no dynamic behavior, input handling, network operations, or secrets. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The purpose is solely to facilitate type safety and documentation, making it inherently safe. All reviewed reports correctly assess the benign nature of this module, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or revision is necessary."
