  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various identifiers and statuses used in the 'omics' service for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Static assignments of string literals used as type annotations, no runtime input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code consists solely of type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors present. The code is straightforward type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple type aliases as string literals for various identifiers and statuses related to the 'omics' service. There is no dynamic code execution, no data processing, no network activity, and no handling of user input. It appears to be a purely declarative module intended for type safety in static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of type aliases for string literals used as identifiers in a specific AWS service SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It is standard, static type definitions meant to improve type safety and code clarity.",
