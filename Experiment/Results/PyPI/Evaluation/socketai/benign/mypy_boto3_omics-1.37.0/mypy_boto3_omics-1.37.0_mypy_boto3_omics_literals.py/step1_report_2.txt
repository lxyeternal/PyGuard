  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service identifiers and related constants for type safety and documentation purposes in Python code.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely declares type literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward and standard definition of Literal types. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a docstring providing documentation and usage examples. It conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, which is standard. Then, it defines multiple constants as Literal types for use in type annotations. All definitions are static, directly mapping string literals to type aliases. No external input, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, safe set of type alias definitions using Literal for AWS service and resource identifiers. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behaviors, and serves solely for type safety and documentation support.",
