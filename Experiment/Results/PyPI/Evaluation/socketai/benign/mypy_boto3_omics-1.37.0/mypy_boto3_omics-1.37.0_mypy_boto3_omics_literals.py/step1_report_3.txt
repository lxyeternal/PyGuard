  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for various AWS and Omics service identifiers, waiters, and status types for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'sys' and conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; the code is limited to type annotations and string literals, with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely type definitions without data flows or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code primarily consists of static string literal definitions. No malicious constructs or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a docstring that documents the purpose and usage, then imports 'sys' and conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version. It then defines multiple constants as Literal types representing AWS services, waiters, and other enumerations. All definitions are static, straightforward, and serve as type annotations. No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external communications are present. The structure is clear and consistent with typical type stub files for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type annotations for AWS and Omics service identifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It functions solely as a static type definition module to aid type checking and validation, with no security risks evident.",
