  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code content, potential security implications, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward static module defining numerous string literal types for AWS and Omics resource identifiers, statuses, waiters, and other enums.\n- It uses conditional import for `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, external data processing, or network operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The purpose appears solely to improve type safety and documentation in SDKs or client code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report-by-Report Review**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Benign, well-structured type annotations for AWS/Omics literals.\n- **Malware / Security Risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code content. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard static type definitions.\n- **Malware / Security Risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Defines types for AWS/Omics identifiers, no dynamic behavior.\n- **Malware / Security Risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Static literals for AWS SDK constants.\n- **Malware / Security Risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Type aliases for Omics identifiers and statuses.\n- **Malware / Security Risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points & Justifications:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static, defining string literal types for type safety.\n- **Malware / Security Risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly note the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Scores Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature—static, non-executable, non-networked, and purely definitional.\n\n### **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n\n- The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to current knowledge (2023). While this isn't a security issue, it might be a typo or placeholder. However, it doesn't affect security or malware assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, since it's a static type definitions module with no dynamic or external dependencies)\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious activity or code execution.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.  \n- The code's purpose is purely for type safety, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Assign a very low risk score (~0.1) to reflect the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS and Omics resource identifiers, with no security risks or malicious behaviors.",
