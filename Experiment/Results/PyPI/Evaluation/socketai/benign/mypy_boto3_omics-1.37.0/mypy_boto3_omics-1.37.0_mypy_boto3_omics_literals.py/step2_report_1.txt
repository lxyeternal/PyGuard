  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, purpose, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a collection of static type alias definitions using `Literal` for various AWS and Omics service resource identifiers, statuses, waiter names, regions, and other constants.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version (3.12+ vs earlier).\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, network operations, or data processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The primary purpose appears to be providing type safety and documentation support for SDKs or client code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, defining string literal types for type annotations.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Data Flow & Sinks:** No data flows involving untrusted sources; no external data or secrets.\n- **Purpose & Use:** The code is meant for type safety, documentation, and clarity in SDKs or client code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis of Reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n\n- All reports correctly state that the code is benign, static, and purely for type annotations.\n- They emphasize the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The descriptions of the import logic and the purpose of the literals are consistent.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Scores & Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, justified because no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, justified because the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified because the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:\n\n- **Any overestimation?** No. All reports are consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Any underestimation?** No, given the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The code's copyright date is 2025, which is in the future relative to current knowledge (2023). While unusual, this is likely a typo or placeholder and not a security concern.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or dynamic code.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe entire set of reports correctly identifies that this module is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS and Omics service identifiers. It is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose without introducing any security or malware risks.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Maintain scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **No further action needed.**\n\nThis code poses no security threat and is purely for type safety and documentation support.",
