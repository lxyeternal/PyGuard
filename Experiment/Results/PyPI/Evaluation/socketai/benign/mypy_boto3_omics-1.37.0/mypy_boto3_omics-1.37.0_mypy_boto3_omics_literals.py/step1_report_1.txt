{
  "purpose": "Define Python type annotations for string literals related to the omics service and various AWS services and resources.",
  "sources": "The code sources input primarily from the import of sys and from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version. It also defines string literal types directly within the module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include data sinks, user input handling, network operations, file operations, or data serialization/deserialization points.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted data sources; the code only declares constants and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code solely defines string literal types and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional import to handle different Python versions for the 'Literal' type. It declares numerous string literal types corresponding to AWS and omics service resource identifiers, likely for type checking and code clarity. The structure is straightforward, defining constants for use elsewhere. No dynamic execution, input handling, or external data processing is involved. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are detected. The code appears to serve a purely definitional purpose for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations defining string literals for AWS resource types and other identifiers used in the omics service SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is safe and intended for type checking purposes only.",
