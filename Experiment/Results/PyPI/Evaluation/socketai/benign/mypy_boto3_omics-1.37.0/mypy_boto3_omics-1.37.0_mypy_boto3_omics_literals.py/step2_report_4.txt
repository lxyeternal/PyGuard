  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report in detail, considering the purpose, source, data flow, anomalies, and overall security implications.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward set of static type alias definitions using `Literal` for various AWS and Omics service identifiers.\n- The code includes conditional imports for `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, network operations, or data serialization/deserialization are present.\n- The code contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The primary purpose appears to be to facilitate type checking and improve code clarity/documentation for SDK usage.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:** None detected.\n- **Functionality:** No runtime behavior or data flow involving untrusted sources; only static definitions.\n\n### Specifics on the reports:\n- All five reports agree on the benign, static nature of the code.\n- They correctly identify that the code serves as a type annotation module, with no malicious intent.\n- The use of conditional import for `Literal` is appropriate and standard.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate; no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since there are no security vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and align with the actual code content.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\nThis code is a benign, well-structured static type definitions module with no security concerns. It is safe for use in any supply chain context.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or revision is needed.",
