{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for use with AWS SDK for omics service, providing type annotations for various enums and constants.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard library imports (sys, typing), and defines constants via Literal assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only declares constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply establishes type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. The code appears to be a straightforward static definitions module.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of type annotations for AWS SDK literals, with conditional import based on Python version. It includes extensive string Literal definitions for various enumerations, waiter names, regions, services, and paginator names. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no credential management. The purpose is purely for type safety and documentation support. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code. The initial copyright notice is benign, and no obfuscated or encoded code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation module defining string literals for AWS SDK constants. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The structure and content are consistent with intended static type definitions for SDK usage.",
