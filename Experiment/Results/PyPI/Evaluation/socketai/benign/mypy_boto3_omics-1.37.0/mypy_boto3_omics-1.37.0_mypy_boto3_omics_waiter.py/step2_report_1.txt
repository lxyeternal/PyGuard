  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes that the code provides typed waiters for AWS 'omics' service, with type definitions and sys.version_info handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity; input kwargs are unpacked into type defs.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a boilerplate or auto-generated SDK stub pattern, serving as type-safe wrappers with documentation links. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. The code is benign, well-structured, and aligns with SDK stub patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines custom waiters with type annotations; imports are standard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses **kwargs passed into wait(), no external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Pure class definitions with documented wait() methods; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, defining waiters with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity; method signatures accept typed kwargs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK pattern, purely defining classes and method signatures with documentation links.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines typed waiter subclasses with documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling; methods are wrappers.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The structure is consistent with SDK patterns; no dynamic code or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly higher risk score, but still very low.\n\n**Justification for risk=0.1:** Given the code is purely defining classes and methods with no external data handling, a very low risk score is justified, perhaps reflecting minimal concern for future misuse or the general risk of SDK code.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score seems reasonable, though slightly conservative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar class definitions with type annotations and documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK extension pattern, safe and straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is mainly class definitions for SDK waiters, with no active logic, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0.\n- **Risk scores:** The only slightly elevated score is in report 4 (0.1), justified by the minimal risk of SDK code being misused, but still very low.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the nature of the code, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 — very low, as it's SDK stub code, which is inherently low risk but can be misused if taken out of context.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, auto-generated SDK boilerplate for AWS 'omics' waiters, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores reflect this understanding appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe and the scoring is reasonable.",
