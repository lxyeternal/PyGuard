{
  "purpose": "Define custom waiters for AWS Omics service client with specific type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs module; class method parameters using **kwargs with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Use of **kwargs to pass parameters into the wait() methods, which are then used internally by the parent Waiter class.",
  "flows": "Parameters from external sources (possibly untrusted) flow into wait() methods via **kwargs, then into the Waiter superclass method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. All code is standard class and method definitions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines waiter subclasses with overridden wait() methods that accept typed keyword arguments. These methods contain docstrings linking to AWS and boto3-stubs documentation. No external input parsing, no network calls, no file operations, no code obfuscation, nor any suspicious logic. The structure and imports are consistent with a typical type-annotated Python SDK wrapper. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of class definitions for waiters with detailed type annotations and documentation links. There is no malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risk present. The implementation strictly adheres to normal SDK extension patterns without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
