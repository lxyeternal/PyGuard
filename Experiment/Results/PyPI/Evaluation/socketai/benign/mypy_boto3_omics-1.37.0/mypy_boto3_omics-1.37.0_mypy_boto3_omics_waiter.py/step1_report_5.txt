  "purpose": "Define custom waiter classes for the AWS 'omics' service client with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, method signatures, type annotations, import statements, and string documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input or data flows; methods are wrappers around base class functionality with type annotations.",
  "flows": "Methods pass through arguments via **kwargs to the superclass 'wait' method; no data flows from untrusted sources into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Use of external type definitions and conditional imports are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple subclasses of 'Waiter' with overridden 'wait' methods that accept specific typed keyword arguments. Each class and method is documented with links to AWS SDK documentation and type stub documentation. The structure is consistent, straightforward, and adheres to standard patterns for defining waiters. No external input handling, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior is present. The conditional import of 'Unpack' is standard for Python version compatibility. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of class definitions for AWS SDK waiters with type annotations. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no evidence of sabotage or malware. It primarily serves to provide typed access to the waiters, with clear documentation and no security risks.",
