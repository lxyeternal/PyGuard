{
  "purpose": "Define waiters for various AWS omics service operations, providing type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs module; class method parameters using **kwargs with type unpacking.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data outputs, network calls, or external data handling within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only method signatures with type annotations and docstrings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations. The code primarily declares classes inheriting from Waiter with wait methods.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for waiters with overridden wait methods accepting specific typed kwargs. It imports standard libraries and local type definitions for type safety. The wait methods contain only docstrings linking to AWS and boto3 documentation, with no executable logic or external data processing. No signs of data leaks, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The code's structure is consistent with standard SDK wrapper patterns, focusing on type annotations and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of class definitions for AWS service waiters with type annotations and documentation links. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It primarily serves as a type-safe interface layer without any suspicious or harmful functionality.",
