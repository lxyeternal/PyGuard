{
  "purpose": "Provide strongly-typed waiter classes for the AWS 'omics' service, enabling easier and safer waiting for specific resource states.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, typing, and botocore; class definitions and method signatures; docstrings referencing external documentation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions; no insecure code execution or data leakage points observed.",
  "flows": "The wait() method signatures accept **kwargs with specific type definitions, passing through to parent class Waiter, with no internal processing or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures; all classes and methods follow standard AWS SDK patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple subclasses of Waiter, each representing a specific resource state wait condition for the AWS 'omics' service. Each class's wait() method is documented with links to external documentation and only accepts typed keyword arguments. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation beyond method signatures. Import statements are standard, and no anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of subclasses for AWS waiters, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a type-safe interface wrapper for AWS SDK waiters, with no harmful or malicious intent.",
