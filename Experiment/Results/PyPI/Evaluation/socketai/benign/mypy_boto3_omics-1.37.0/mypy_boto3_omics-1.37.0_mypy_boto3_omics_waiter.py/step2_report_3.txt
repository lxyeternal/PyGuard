  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logical consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code provides typed waiters for AWS 'omics' service, based on type definitions and sys.version_info handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data output or network activity; input kwargs are unpacked into type defs.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a boilerplate SDK stub pattern, providing type-safe class wrappers with documentation links. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion that this is benign, auto-generated SDK stub code is accurate. The scores of malware (0) and obfuscated (0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes class definitions with type annotations, using **kwargs and local type_defs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into wait() methods via kwargs, which are then used internally.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard class inheritance with typed methods, no external data handling or network activity.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. Malware score of 0 is justified; no obfuscation or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, defining waiters with type annotations and documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data output or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, serving as SDK wrappers with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identifies the benign nature. Malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; defining waiter subclasses with type annotations and documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-structured, standard SDK pattern code, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Note:** The report assigns a slightly lower confidence (0.9) and notes a small security risk (0.1), perhaps due to the general caution about code that accepts external kwargs. However, in this context, it's just method signatures with no execution of untrusted data.\n\n**Assessment:** The code remains benign; the minor security risk score might be a conservative placeholder but is not indicative of actual vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, defining waiters with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK pattern, purely for type safety and documentation.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion that this is benign, with no malicious intent, is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify the code as SDK stub classes for AWS 'omics' waiters, with no actual implementation logic beyond method signatures and documentation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports agree on malware (0) and obfuscated (0), which is consistent with the code.\n- **Security Risk:** No real security risks are present; minor scores reflect cautious acknowledgment of the pattern, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable, boilerplate SDK stub code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risk; purely type annotations and documentation links.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, auto-generated set of type stubs for AWS SDK waiters, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.",
