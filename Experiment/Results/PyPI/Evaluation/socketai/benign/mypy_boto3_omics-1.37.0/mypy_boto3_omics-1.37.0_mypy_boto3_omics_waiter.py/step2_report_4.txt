  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states the code provides typed waiters for AWS 'omics' service, based on type definitions and standard SDK patterns.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data, network activity, or data leaks are identified.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code appears auto-generated, with extensive documentation links. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, auto-generated SDK stub code with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (or less).\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent with a benign SDK stub. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines custom waiters with type annotations, similar pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling, just method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no network activity, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard SDK extension pattern, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Also benign, straightforward class definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, defining waiters with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious constructs or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Clear, safe SDK stub code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with benign SDK code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines waiters, referencing documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-structured, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (or very low).\n\n**Assessment:** Still benign, possibly slightly higher risk due to the broader scope, but nothing suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern, type annotations, class definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is purely class definitions for waiters, with no implementation logic, network calls, or data handling. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the benign nature, the risk scores should be very low, close to 0, perhaps slightly above 0 if considering the potential for misuse of **kwargs, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be 0 or very close to 0, given the code's nature as SDK stubs.\n\n### Additional Justification:\n\n- The code is standard for SDK type stubs, providing type safety and documentation links.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic.\n- The extensive documentation and straightforward class structures further support benign intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a set of auto-generated or boilerplate SDK type stubs for AWS 'omics' waiters, with no malicious intent or security risk. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and risk scores at 0 or negligible.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
