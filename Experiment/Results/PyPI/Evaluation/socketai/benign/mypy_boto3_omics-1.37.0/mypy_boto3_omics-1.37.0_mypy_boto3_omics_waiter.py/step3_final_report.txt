{
  "purpose": "Defines typed waiters for AWS 'omics' service client, providing class structures with documentation links for various wait conditions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with wait() methods accepting **kwargs unpacked into type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No external data handling, network activity, or data leaks; methods only process input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into wait() methods, which invoke the parent Waiter.wait() with typed parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected; straightforward class structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of subclass definitions of Waiter, each with a wait() method accepting typed kwargs. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The structure aligns with SDK stub patterns, serving as type-safe wrappers with documentation links. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, auto-generated SDK stub classes for AWS 'omics' waiters, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
