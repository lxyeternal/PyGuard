  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its structure, and the provided descriptions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code provides typed waiters for AWS 'omics' SDK, with type definitions imported from '.type_defs' and sys.version_info for compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data outputs or network activity; only method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors. The code appears auto-generated or boilerplate, with documentation links.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is accurate; no malicious intent detected.\n\n**Score Suggestions:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; defines custom waiters with precise type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into wait() via **kwargs, which are passed to the parent class.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no dynamic execution, no network activity. The structure is typical for SDK wrappers.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Suggestions:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining waiters with type annotations and documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or network calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious constructs; standard class and method definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; code appears benign and standard.\n\n**Score Suggestions:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Well-identified; defines subclasses for AWS waiters with documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns; follows SDK extension patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent with benign SDK wrapper code.\n\n**Score Suggestions:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (the report assigns 0.1 risk, which is cautious but not unreasonable given the code's nature)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes class definitions, type annotations, and documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or external calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; the code is a standard SDK wrapper.\n\n**Score Suggestions:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, with scores at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation, with scores at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0, with one assigning 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0** (or at most 0.1 if being overly cautious)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, auto-generated set of type stub classes for AWS 'omics' waiters. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks. The documentation links and structure are consistent with SDK extension patterns, serving as a type-safe interface layer. The reported scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
