{
  "purpose": "Define typed paginator classes for various AWS Omics service operations, enabling type-safe pagination with boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class method parameters for paginate functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data; no network connections, file writes, or code execution; only type annotations and class definitions.",
  "flows": "Method calls to 'client.get_paginator' with string literals, then 'paginate' methods with keyword arguments unpacked from type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; standard pattern of defining paginator subclasses with type annotations and no dynamic code execution or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type-safe wrapper classes around boto3 paginators for the AWS Omics service, utilizing type annotations for input parameters and response types. Conditional imports for 'Unpack' from 'typing_extensions' are used based on Python version. All class methods are straightforward overrides of the 'paginate' method, with no additional logic or side effects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or code intended to perform harmful actions. The code appears to be a generated, type-focused SDK layer intended for improved development experience, with no runtime risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type declaration and subclassing pattern for boto3 paginators. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is likely auto-generated for type safety and documentation support. Overall, the security risk is negligible.",
