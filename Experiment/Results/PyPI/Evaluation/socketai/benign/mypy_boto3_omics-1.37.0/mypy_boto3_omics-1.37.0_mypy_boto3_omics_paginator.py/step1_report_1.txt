{
  "purpose": "Provide typed paginator classes for the boto3 omics service, enabling type-safe pagination in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class method definitions with parameters unpacked from type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data sinks or external data processing evident; no untrusted input handling or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Pagination method calls with unpacked parameters from type definitions; no external data flows or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extensive but primarily boilerplate class definitions with standard boto3 paginator wrapping; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs. Usage of 'Unpack' for type annotations is standard for Python 3.12+ compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes inheriting from a generic Paginator, with type annotations aligned to corresponding response and request types. It employs conditional imports based on Python version and uses type hints for method parameters. No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be generated boilerplate for type-safe boto3 pagination, with documentation links provided for clarity. No malicious behavior or sabotage patterns such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a structured set of type annotations and class wrappers for boto3 paginator objects, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate code aimed at improving type safety and developer experience.",
