{
  "purpose": "This code defines paginator classes for the boto3 omics service client, providing type-safe interfaces for paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from imported modules, and within each class, the 'paginate' method receives '**kwargs' as input, which are unpacked into the request parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods call the underlying 'PageIterator' with the provided kwargs; no other untrusted data sources are present.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs are passed directly to the paginator's 'paginate' method; there are no flows involving untrusted external data or network operations within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive type annotations and class definitions but no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code appears to be standard SDK wrapper definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes inheriting from a generic 'Paginator' base, with 'paginate' methods that accept kwargs unpacked into request parameters. The type annotations and structure conform to typical boto3-stubs patterns, designed for type safety and IDE support. No suspicious behavior, external data sources, or malicious code is evident. The purpose is purely to provide type-safe pagination wrappers for the boto3 omics client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for boto3, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely provides type annotations and interface definitions for pagination. No malware or security threats are identified.",
