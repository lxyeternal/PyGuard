  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable from a string literal",
  "sinks": "None present",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future date (2025), which is unusual and potentially suspicious if the current year is earlier",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a variable __version__, with an accompanying copyright notice. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no code execution, nor any suspicious logic. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which could suggest misdirection or outdated/incorrect metadata, but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version assignment with no malicious behavior detected. The only noteworthy aspect is the future copyright year, which is likely a mistake or oversight rather than malicious activity.",
