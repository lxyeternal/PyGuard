  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n   - No untrusted data sources, external calls, or dynamic behavior are present.\n   - The code is standard for version declaration in Python modules.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - The only minor point is the mention of the future copyright year (2025) in report 4, which could be an oversight but not a security concern.\n   - The comment about \"source of truth\" is typical and not misleading in a malicious way.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, indicating no risk, which is justified given the code's simplicity.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code is a static version assignment with no external dependencies or suspicious logic.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate and justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unfounded assumptions.\n   - The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code and analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent. The only minor note is the future copyright year, which is likely an oversight rather than a security concern.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's nature.",
