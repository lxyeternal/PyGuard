  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software as a static string, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is a static assignment of a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the version string is assigned directly to __version__ without external input or dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string with a comment. No external inputs, data flows, or suspicious constructs are present. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The code is clear, simple, and standard for version declaration. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0. Confidence is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not constitute a security concern. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
