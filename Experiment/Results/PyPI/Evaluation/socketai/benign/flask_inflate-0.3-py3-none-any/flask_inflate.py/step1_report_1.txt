  "flows": "Reading request.content_encoding -> Checking for 'gzip' -> Wrapping request.stream with gzip.GzipFile for decompression",
  "anomalies": "None observed; standard gzipped content handling, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Flask middleware component to decompress gzipped request bodies. It checks if the incoming request's content encoding is 'gzip' and, if so, wraps the request stream with gzip.GzipFile for decompression. The approach appears standard and safe; it does not manipulate data beyond decompression, nor does it involve any suspicious code. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code relies on Flask's request object and standard gzip library, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard gzipped request decompression middleware without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for handling gzipped HTTP requests.",
