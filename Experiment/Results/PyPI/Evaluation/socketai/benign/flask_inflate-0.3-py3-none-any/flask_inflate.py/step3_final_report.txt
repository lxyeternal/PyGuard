  "purpose": "Middleware to decompress gzipped request content in Flask applications.",
  "sources": "Request headers ('content_encoding'), request.stream",
  "sinks": "request.stream after wrapping with gzip.GzipFile",
  "flows": "Header check for 'gzip' -> wrapping request.stream with gzip.GzipFile",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard gzip decompression logic; potential resource exhaustion if input is malicious, but not malicious itself",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward check of the 'content_encoding' header; if 'gzip', it wraps the request stream with gzip.GzipFile for decompression. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The approach is standard and widely used. The main security consideration is resource exhaustion if the input stream is maliciously crafted, but this is a known risk of such middleware, not an active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for handling gzipped request bodies in Flask. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern primarily related to resource exhaustion potential, which is typical for such middleware.",
