{
  "purpose": "The code provides geographic distance calculations, spatial queries on a MongoDB database, and map visualization functionalities using folium for plotting circles and embedding maps in IPython notebooks.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters (source, target, database, location, map object, etc.), and external libraries (vincenty, bson, folium, IPython.display).",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to files or executes untrusted input; the map rendering functions generate HTML/iframe outputs for display.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions like distance(), nearest(), and Map methods; data from database queries is used for visualization, with no untrusted data written to external systems or executed.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code and unused functions (e.g., the 'export_map' function), no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code segments; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs geographic distance calculations, spatial queries on MongoDB, and map visualizations with folium. No evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. Functions accept parameters and process data securely within their scope. The use of external libraries appears legitimate for mapping and spatial analysis purposes. No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code does not write to or read from sensitive external sources unsafely; all output is HTML/iframe embeds for visualization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily for geographic computations and map visualizations. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. It appears safe and intended for geographic analysis and presentation purposes only.",
