{
  "purpose": "Provides geospatial distance calculations, MongoDB geospatial queries, and map visualization utilities using folium.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, database queries, and map object methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs HTML embeds for visualization; no untrusted data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to database queries and visualization functions; no suspicious source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; commented-out code is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries for geospatial calculations and visualization. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The HTML sanitization is standard practice. The code structure is clear and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign geospatial utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The high security risk scores in some reports are overestimated; a score of approximately 0.1 better reflects the minimal risk. Malware and obfuscation scores should be 0.",
