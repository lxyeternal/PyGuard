{
  "purpose": "The code provides geospatial analysis and visualization functionalities, including distance calculations, MongoDB geospatial queries, and interactive map rendering using Folium.",
  "sources": "User input parameters such as 'location' in functions, database queries, and map configurations.",
  "sinks": "Map rendering and embedding HTML iframes in Jupyter notebooks; database updates.",
  "flows": "Input data (location, database) flows into geospatial calculations and database queries; query results influence map visualizations and database updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys observed. The code contains commented-out functions that seem unrelated or incomplete. Map HTML embedding replaces quotes with HTML entities but does not perform any suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly focuses on geospatial computations and map visualizations. It imports standard libraries for map rendering and database querying, with no evidence of obfuscated or malicious code. Functions process data and generate visual outputs or database updates. No network connections or data exfiltration routines are present. Commented-out code does not indicate malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward geospatial analysis and visualization tool. It utilizes standard libraries and practices without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It does not perform any unauthorized data access, exfiltration, or system manipulation.",
