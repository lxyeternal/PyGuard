  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility for fetching and displaying data from a web resource.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from an HTTP request to an external URL and possibly from environment variables or configuration files if present.",
  "sinks": "It outputs data to the console and may write to files or network sockets if included.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the network input (HTTP response) through processing functions, then to output streams such as print statements or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious URL patterns detected; no obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches data from an external URL, processes it minimally, and outputs the result. No malicious behaviors like data exfiltration, system modification, or code injection are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is standard. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with common patterns for web data fetching.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code performs a benign task of retrieving and displaying data from a web source.",
