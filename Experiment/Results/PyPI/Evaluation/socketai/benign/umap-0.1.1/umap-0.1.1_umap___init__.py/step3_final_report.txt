  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network fetches, class definitions, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network transmissions, environment variable access, file I/O, eval/exec functions.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) potentially flow into eval/exec, system commands, or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of eval/exec without validation, unvalidated input in network/system operations, no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets and reports indicate mostly benign patterns such as data handling, configuration, and data fetching. Report 1 notes potential eval/exec usage and unvalidated inputs, which pose moderate security risks but no confirmed malicious payloads. Other reports describe straightforward, well-structured code with no suspicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned are consistent with the described patterns, with slight suspicion in Report 1 due to ambiguous eval usage. Overall, no definitive malware is present, and the code appears low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no confirmed malicious behavior. Potential concerns in Report 1 are noted but lack concrete evidence. The code is generally benign with low security risks. The malware score is set at 0, obfuscation at 0, and overall risk at approximately 0.2, reflecting cautious but benign assessment.",
