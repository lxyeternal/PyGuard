  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'umap' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data within the 'config' dictionary and import statements for setup tools.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical errors in keys ('install_requirements' should be 'install_requires'; 'include_pakcage_data' should be 'include_package_data') but these are likely misconfigurations, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to configure package setup using setuptools or distutils. The configuration data is static and contains no user input or external data sources. The misspelled keys suggest misconfiguration but not malicious intent. No code executes external commands, reads environment variables, or handles untrusted input. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated code are present. The purpose is clearly to prepare package metadata for distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with minor typographical errors and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The package appears to be benign.",
