  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'umap'.",
  "sources": "Reads package configuration data, author info, URLs, and dependencies from the script variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration data is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in 'install_requirements' (should be 'install_requires'), 'include_pakcage_data' typo, and potential misconfiguration. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It conditionally imports setup functions, defines a configuration dictionary, and calls setup with that configuration. No dynamic execution, external data sources, or suspicious code patterns are present. The typos are likely unintentional and do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script with minor typos and no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
