  "purpose": "Generate a 3D model consisting of a cube with spherical dents on its surface.",
  "sources": "Import from manifold3d library, input parameters n and overlap, and the range in the list comprehension for sphere positions.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that performs subtraction of spheres from the cube, involving the sum of sphere objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence sphere sizes and positions; spheres are generated and combined; the combined spheres are subtracted from the cube object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual network calls, or suspicious data handling. The code is straightforward 3D model generation. The commented-out reduce function does not affect runtime.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 3D modeling library, creates a cube, generates a grid of spheres, and subtracts their combined shape from the cube. The sphere size varies based on the 'overlap' parameter. No user input handling, no external network activity, and no hidden or malicious code. The code appears to be a typical 3D modeling script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign 3D model generation utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
