  "purpose": "Generate a 3D shape by creating a cube and subtracting a grid of spheres to produce dents or features, using the manifold3d library.",
  "sources": "The code reads parameters 'n' and 'overlap' for shape dimensions and sphere sizes; no external data sources or input streams are used.",
  "sinks": "The code performs geometric operations internally and returns a Manifold object; no external data output, network communication, or file I/O occurs.",
  "flows": "Parameters influence sphere sizes and positions; the subtraction operation creates the final shape; data flows are confined within geometric transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present. The commented-out 'reduce' line is benign and inactive.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a cube and a grid of spheres, then subtracts the spheres from the cube to form a dented shape. It uses standard library functions without external data or network activity. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The code is straightforward and intended for geometric modeling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, performing standard 3D shape operations without malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is justified, and no malware or obfuscation concerns are present.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
