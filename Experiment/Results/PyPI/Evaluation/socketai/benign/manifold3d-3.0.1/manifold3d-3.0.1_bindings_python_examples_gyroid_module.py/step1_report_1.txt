{
  "purpose": "The code generates a 3D mathematical manifold shape using gyroid structures and geometric transformations, likely for visualization or modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions such as size, n, and level, as well as module imports like math, numpy, and manifold3d.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks, network activity, or malicious data manipulation are present. No external data is sent or received.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions to create and manipulate 3D shapes; no external or untrusted data flows to critical system components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution are present. The code appears straightforward and mathematically oriented.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a specific 'manifold3d' library for 3D shape modeling. It defines functions to generate gyroid-based structures and other geometries, then combines them through boolean operations. No external network connections, file operations, or system modifications are observed. The code relies solely on mathematical computations and library functions for 3D modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign mathematical modeling tool for generating complex 3D structures, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security threats.",
