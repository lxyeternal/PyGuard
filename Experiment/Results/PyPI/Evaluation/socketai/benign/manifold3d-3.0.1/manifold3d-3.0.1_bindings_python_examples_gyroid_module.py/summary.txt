  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mathematical 3D modeling script with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing assessments are accurate; the minor security risk scores of 0.1 should be adjusted to 0. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0. Overall, the dependency poses no security threat."
