  "purpose": "Generate 3D geometric models using mathematical functions and transformations, likely for visualization or modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads import statements, function parameters, and external library functions (manifold3d.Manifold). No direct external input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "Uses methods from Manifold class such as level_set, cube, rotate, translate, and operators for geometric transformations. No data output or external system interactions detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters into geometric functions and transformations. The core calculations involve mathematical functions (gyroid) and geometric operations, with no untrusted input to external systems or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to perform standard mathematical and geometric operations for modeling purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate complex 3D geometries using mathematical functions (gyroid) and geometric transformations. It uses standard Python libraries (math, numpy) and a custom 'manifold3d' library for 3D modeling. The functions are well-structured, with no evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. No external input handling or network operations are present, and the operations are typical for 3D procedural generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a mathematical 3D model generator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be for visualization or modeling purposes, with no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
