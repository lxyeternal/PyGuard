{
  "purpose": "The code generates a 3D mathematical model of a gyroid structure and other geometric shapes for visualization or computational modeling.",
  "sources": "The code reads mathematical constants (pi), function parameters, and potentially external libraries (manifold3d, numpy).",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any explicit sinks that process untrusted input or data for external transmission or file writing. No network or file operations are visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs to the geometric modeling functions within the manifold library, but no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward mathematical modeling without suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for generating complex 3D shapes based on mathematical formulas and combines them using operations such as union (^), subtraction (-), rotation, and translation. It relies on the 'manifold3d' library to create and manipulate 3D models. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a geometric modeling script intended for generating 3D objects, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a mathematical 3D shape generator with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions purely for modeling purposes without any suspicious or harmful code elements.",
