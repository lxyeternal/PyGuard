{
  "purpose": "The code generates 3D models of brick walls, floors, and structures using the manifold3d library, likely for visual or structural modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for dimensions (width, length, height), constants for brick and mortar dimensions, and potentially external libraries.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily uses library functions like Manifold.cube(), translate(), rotate(), and sum() to construct 3D models; no direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to calculate geometric transformations which are passed to library functions to generate and assemble 3D models. No external data flows or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated features, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward geometric modeling using a known library.",
  "analysis": "The script is a geometric modeling utility that constructs brick and wall structures via library calls. No input validation, no external data fetching, and no code injection mechanisms are observed. The code appears to be for visual or structural modeling, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for creating 3D brick wall models with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies solely on a 3D modeling library and standard geometric calculations.",
