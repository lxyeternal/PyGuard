  "purpose": "Generate 3D brick and wall models using manifold3d library functions for architectural or visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for dimensions, constants defining brick sizes, and the imported manifold3d library functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, network calls, or data leaks; geometric transformations are performed locally within the code.",
  "flows": "Parameters are used to create bricks, which are translated and combined into rows, walls, and floors without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. The URL comment is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward procedural script constructing 3D brick structures via geometric transformations. It relies solely on the manifold3d library and local parameters. No external data sources, network activity, or untrusted inputs are involved. The functions generate geometry through translation, rotation, and summation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The external URL is a benign reference. The assigned scores in the provided reports are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign 3D modeling utility with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
