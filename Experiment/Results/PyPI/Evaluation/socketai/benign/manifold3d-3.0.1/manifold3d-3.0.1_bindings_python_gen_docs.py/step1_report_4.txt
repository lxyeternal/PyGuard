{
  "purpose": "The script processes C++ source code files to extract comments and function signatures, modifies comment text, and generates a C++ header file with docstring constants for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading source code files (`*.cpp`, `*.h`) from specified directories, reading a documentation override text file.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a generated header file (`autogen_docstrings.inl`), printing error messages to stdout.",
  "flows": "Source files are read line-by-line, comments and function signatures are parsed and stored in a dictionary, then the data is used to generate a C++ header file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. Usage of regex for parsing appears safe and standard. No obfuscated code features present. No dynamic code execution, code injection, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of C++ source files, extracting comments and function signatures, and processes them for documentation purposes. It uses regex for parsing, reads multiple source files, and writes a generated header file. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious payloads are present. The script's logic is focused on text processing and file I/O without any suspicious or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided script is a standard code processing utility for documentation generation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include or execute any harmful code or exhibit behaviors associated with malware or supply chain attacks.",
