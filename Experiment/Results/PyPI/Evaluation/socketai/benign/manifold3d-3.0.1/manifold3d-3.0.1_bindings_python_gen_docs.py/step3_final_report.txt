  "purpose": "Static source code processing to extract comments and function signatures from C++ files, modify text, and generate a header file with embedded documentation strings.",
  "sources": "Reading C++ source and header files, parsing lines for comments and function signatures.",
  "sinks": "Writing generated documentation strings into a header file.",
  "flows": "File reading -> regex parsing -> comment and signature extraction -> text modification -> file writing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, network activity, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of source files, extracting comments and function signatures via regex, modifying text, and generating a header file with documentation strings. It uses straightforward file I/O and string processing with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present. The operations are purely static and benign, aimed at documentation generation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign static documentation generator for C++ source files. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
