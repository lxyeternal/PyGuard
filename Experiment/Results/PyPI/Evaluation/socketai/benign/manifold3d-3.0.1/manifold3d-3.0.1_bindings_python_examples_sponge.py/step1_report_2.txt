{
  "purpose": "The code generates a 3D fractal structure using the manifold3d library, creating a cube with holes removed in a recursive pattern, then applies transformations and color properties.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'n' in run(), external libraries (manifold3d, numpy), and data generated within fractal function (holes array, position, offsets).",
  "sinks": "Operations on the 'result' object, including subtraction of 'hole' objects, rotation, trimming, property setting, and scaling.",
  "flows": "Input 'n' controls recursion depth, affecting the holes generated; holes are scaled and translated; these are subtracted from the main cube; transformations are applied; properties are set; final object is scaled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. Use of recursive fractal generation is typical for 3D modeling. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard 3D modeling functions to generate fractal geometry, with recursion controlling the level of detail. Data flows from parameters to geometry operations without involving external untrusted data sources or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoors are present. It appears to be a legitimate 3D modeling script intended for visual generation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard fractal generation script for 3D models, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs geometry processing using the manifold3d library without any suspicious operations.",
