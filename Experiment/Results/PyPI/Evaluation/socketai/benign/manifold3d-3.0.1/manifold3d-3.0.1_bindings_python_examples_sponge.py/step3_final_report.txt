  "purpose": "Generates a 3D fractal pattern by recursively creating scaled holes within a cube, utilizing manifold3d library functions for geometric modeling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for recursion depth and initial shape, external manifold3d library functions for shape creation and manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Geometric operations such as subtraction, rotation, scaling, and property setting; no external data or network sinks present.",
  "flows": "Recursive fractal function influences the geometry through scaled and translated holes; geometric transformations modify the main shape based on recursive calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric modeling to produce a fractal shape, with no network activity, file I/O, or malicious code. The recursive pattern and shape manipulations are typical for procedural modeling. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code’s purpose appears benign, focused on 3D shape generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard 3D fractal generator with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (to reflect minimal inherent complexity but no actual threat).",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
