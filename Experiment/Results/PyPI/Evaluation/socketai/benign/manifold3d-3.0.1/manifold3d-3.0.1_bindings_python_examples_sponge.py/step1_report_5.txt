{
  "purpose": "Generate a 3D fractal structure using the Manifold library, involving recursive hole creation and manipulation of 3D shapes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (n, position arrays, maxDepth), import statements",
  "sinks": "Operations on the 'result' and 'holes' objects, especially the subtract and rotate methods, property setting, and scaling",
  "flows": "Fractal holes are generated from the initial cube, then subtracted and rotated to create the final shape; property functions are applied at the end",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; use of numpy for position calculations appears standard; no network or file operations",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a fractal 3D shape using the 'manifold3d' library, with recursive hole creation. No untrusted input sources or network activity are present. The subtraction, rotation, and scaling are typical geometric operations. The property function sets visual properties, likely for rendering. No code indicates data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is well-structured for geometric modeling, with no suspicious anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign geometric fractal generator using the Manifold library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
