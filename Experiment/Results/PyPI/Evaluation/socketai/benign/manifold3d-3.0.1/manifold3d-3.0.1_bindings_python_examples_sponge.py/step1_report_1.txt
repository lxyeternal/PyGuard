{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate a 3D fractal structure using the manifold3d library, creating a cube with holes in a recursive pattern, then manipulating the resulting 3D model.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for the run() function (n), and the initial cube creation via Manifold.cube(). The code also reads data during recursive fractal generation and geometric transformations.",
  "sinks": "The code performs geometric transformations and manipulations on 3D models, with no direct data output, network communication, or system commands. No untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (n) influence recursive fractal depth. The fractal function processes geometry data, which is then combined, subtracted, and transformed to produce the final model.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Usage of numpy for coordinate calculations is standard. The code uses geometric transformations, typical for 3D model generation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 3D modeling library and numpy, then defines a recursive fractal function that modifies a list of 'holes' in a 3D shape. The run() function creates a cube, applies the fractal pattern, subtracts the holes from the cube, rotates and scales the model, and assigns visual properties. There are no network operations, file I/O, or suspicious behaviors. The code strictly manipulates 3D geometries and properties, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard 3D fractal generator using the manifold3d library. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. It performs geometric calculations and transformations for visual or modeling purposes only.",
