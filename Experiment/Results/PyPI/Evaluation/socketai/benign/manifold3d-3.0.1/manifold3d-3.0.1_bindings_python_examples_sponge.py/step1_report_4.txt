  "purpose": "Generate a fractal 3D shape by recursively creating holes within a cube and subtracting them from the main shape.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (n in run()), external libraries (manifold3d, numpy).",
  "sinks": "Manipulation of 3D manifold objects, subtraction, rotation, and scaling operations.",
  "flows": "Parameters (n) control recursion depth -> fractal function generates holes -> holes are combined and subtracted from main shape -> final shape is transformed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows observed. Use of external libraries appears standard for 3D shape manipulation. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual variable names. No data exfiltration or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a recursive function 'fractal' that creates smaller scaled holes in a 3D shape. The 'run' function creates a cube, applies the fractal pattern of holes, and subtracts these from the main shape, then applies transformations before returning the final object. The usage of 'manifold3d' and 'numpy' appears legitimate for 3D modeling. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, network access, or hidden backdoors. The code's structure and logic are consistent with procedural shape generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign 3D fractal shape generator utilizing standard external libraries for modeling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
