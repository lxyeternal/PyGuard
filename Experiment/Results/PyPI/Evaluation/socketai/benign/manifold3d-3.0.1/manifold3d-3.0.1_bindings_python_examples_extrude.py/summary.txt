  "conclusion": "The code is a benign geometric validation routine with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero. The previous minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report can be adjusted to 0 for consistency, as there is no evidence of any security concern."
