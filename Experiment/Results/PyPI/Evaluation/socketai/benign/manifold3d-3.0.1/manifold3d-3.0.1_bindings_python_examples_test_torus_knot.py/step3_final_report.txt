  "purpose": "Generates a 3D torus knot model using numpy and manifold3d, applying geometric transformations and warping functions for visualization or modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters defining the knot (p, q), radii, and segment counts; no external untrusted data sources or file/network I/O.",
  "sinks": "Produces a geometric 3D model object; no data leaks, network communication, or external system effects.",
  "flows": "Uses parametric equations to generate points, applies rotation matrices and warp functions to transform data from source parameters to the final 3D mesh.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard mathematical operations for modeling a torus knot, utilizing numpy for calculations and manifold3d for mesh generation. It includes test cases verifying volume, surface area, and genus, indicating its purpose as a geometric modeling tool. No network activity, file I/O, or environment variable access is present. The functions for rotation and transformation are straightforward, and the use of default parameters is benign. The security implications are minimal, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, well-structured nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured geometric modeling script for creating a torus knot. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses negligible security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
