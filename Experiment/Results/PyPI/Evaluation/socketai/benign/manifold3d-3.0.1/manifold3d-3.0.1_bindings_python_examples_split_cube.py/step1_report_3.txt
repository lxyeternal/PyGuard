{
  "purpose": "The code creates and manipulates 3D cube objects using the Manifold library, performing operations like rotation and splitting the cube.",
  "sources": "Input data from hardcoded lists for cube dimensions and rotation angles within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data manipulation occurs within the local context; no external data sinks or network outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Cube creation -> rotation -> split operation; all within local memory without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be standard 3D geometry processing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Manifold library and defines a function that creates two cubes, rotates one, and splits it. There are no external data inputs, no untrusted data flows, and no suspicious or obfuscated code. The operations are standard geometric manipulations. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward 3D geometry processing code with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs local operations using a known library, with no external data leaks or harmful actions.",
