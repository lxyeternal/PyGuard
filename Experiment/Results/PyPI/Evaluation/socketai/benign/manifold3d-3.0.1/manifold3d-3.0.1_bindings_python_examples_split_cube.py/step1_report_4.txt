  "purpose": "Create and manipulate 3D cube objects using the Manifold library, perform a rotation and split operation.",
  "sources": "Importing the manifold3d library, creating Manifold cube objects, calling rotate() and split() methods.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs a subset of the split result; no untrusted data handling or external communication detected.",
  "flows": "Object creation (cube) -> rotation -> split operation -> return result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Usage appears straightforward for 3D modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 3D modeling library, creates cube objects, applies rotation, and splits one cube using another. No external inputs, network calls, or data exfiltration observed. Methods used are typical for 3D geometry manipulation. The code is simple and focused on geometric operations, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard 3D object operations with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate within its intended 3D modeling context.",
