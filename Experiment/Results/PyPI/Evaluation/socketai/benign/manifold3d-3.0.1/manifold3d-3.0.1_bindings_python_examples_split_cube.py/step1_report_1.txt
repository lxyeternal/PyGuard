{
  "purpose": "Create and manipulate 3D manifold objects, specifically creating a cube, rotating it, and splitting another cube with it.",
  "sources": "Import of 'manifold3d' library; creation of cube objects; method calls on these objects (cube, rotate, split).",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result of a split operation, but no untrusted data or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No external data input; internal method calls on imported library objects; result returned from the run() function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific library ('manifold3d') for 3D object manipulation. It defines a run() function that creates a cube, applies a rotation, and splits another cube with it, returning a part of the split. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network operations, no data leakage mechanisms, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward use of a 3D geometry library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign example of 3D object manipulation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely within the scope of 3D geometry processing.",
