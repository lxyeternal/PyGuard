{
  "purpose": "The code creates and manipulates 3D cube objects using the manifold3d library, performing a split operation between two cube objects.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from hardcoded parameters in manifold3d library methods (cube creation and rotation). No external or untrusted input is read.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to files, network, or other sinks. It only performs in-memory operations and returns a value.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; data flows are internal to object methods with predefined parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior are present. The code uses standard library functions and simple object manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a library and creates two cube objects, applying a rotation to one. It then splits the first cube with the rotated one and returns part of the split. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated behavior, or suspicious network or system interactions. The code performs standard 3D object manipulation without any apparent security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign 3D modeling snippet with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It only involves in-memory operations on 3D objects using a known library, with no external data or system access.",
