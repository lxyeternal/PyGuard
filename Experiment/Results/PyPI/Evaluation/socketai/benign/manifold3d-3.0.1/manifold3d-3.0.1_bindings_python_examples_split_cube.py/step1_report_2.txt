  "purpose": "Create and manipulate 3D cube models using the Manifold library, including rotation and splitting operations.",
  "sources": "Importing the manifold3d library; creating cube objects with specified dimensions",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs a split result, but no data leaks or external outputs occur",
  "flows": "Create cube -> rotate cube -> split cube with another cube -> return part of split",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no unusual behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard 3D modeling library, constructs cube objects, applies rotation, and performs a split operation, then returns part of the result. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data leaks. The operations appear to be standard usage of the library for 3D object manipulation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical usage of a 3D geometry library for modeling purposes. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are evident.",
