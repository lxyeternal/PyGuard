  "purpose": "Create and manipulate 3D cube objects using the manifold3d library, performing rotation and splitting operations.",
  "sources": "Library import 'manifold3d' and its methods 'cube', 'rotate', and 'split'.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, network calls, or data leaks; operations are confined to in-memory object manipulation.",
  "flows": "Create cube -> rotate cube -> split cube with another cube -> return part of split.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard 3D geometry operations using a well-known library, with no external communication or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and obfuscated scores of 0. The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is slightly overcautious. Given the straightforward operations and lack of external interactions, the overall security assessment is that the code poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and uses standard library functions for 3D modeling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The minor security risk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the dependency and code do not pose any security concern.",
