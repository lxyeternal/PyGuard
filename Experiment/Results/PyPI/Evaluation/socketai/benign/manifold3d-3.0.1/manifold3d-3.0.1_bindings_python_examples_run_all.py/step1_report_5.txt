{
  "purpose": "The script loads and processes 3D model modules in the current directory, generates meshes, and optionally exports them in GLB format.",
  "sources": "Reads Python modules in the same directory via importlib, accesses model objects and their mesh data, and reads command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Exports meshes to files when '-e' argument is provided, writes files to disk.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> calls module.run() -> converts models to meshes -> optionally exports files; command-line args control export behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. Uses standard libraries; no suspicious dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports all Python files in its directory except itself. For each module, it executes the 'run' method, then converts the returned model to a mesh object, which may include vertex properties such as color. If the '-e' argument is provided, it exports the mesh to a GLB file using trimesh's export functionality. The code measures and reports execution time per module. No input from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no suspicious code are present. It functions as a batch 3D model processing script without apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate processing of 3D models with optional exporting, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It relies on external modules and standard libraries to operate as intended.",
