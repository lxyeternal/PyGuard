{
  "purpose": "This script dynamically loads modules, generates 3D models via a run() method, and optionally exports them as GLB files.",
  "sources": "Reading the script's directory for Python files, importing modules, and reading the 'run' method and 'to_mesh' method outputs.",
  "sinks": "Exporting mesh files as '.glb' format, printing status messages, and potentially importing modules dynamically.",
  "flows": "Module import -> model.run() -> model.to_mesh() -> mesh data processing -> export_mesh (if '-e' flag) -> file output",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic module imports based on directory files, and exporting files without validation or sanitization. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code lists Python files in its directory, imports each as a module, calls a run() method expected to return a model object, then converts that model to a mesh. If the '-e' argument is provided, it exports the mesh as a GLB file. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execute malicious code. The module import is dynamic, but within a controlled local directory, which is common for plugin architectures. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward, primarily for generating and optionally exporting 3D models.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for processing 3D models, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It performs file system operations, dynamic imports, and file exports in a standard manner without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
