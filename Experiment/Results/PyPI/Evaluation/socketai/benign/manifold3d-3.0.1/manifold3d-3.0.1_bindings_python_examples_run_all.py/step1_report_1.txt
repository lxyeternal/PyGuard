  "purpose": "The script dynamically loads modules from the current directory and processes models to convert them into mesh objects, optionally exporting them as .glb files.",
  "sources": "Reading current directory for Python files, importing modules dynamically, calling module.run() to generate models.",
  "sinks": "Exporting mesh files using trimesh.exchange.export.export_mesh, which writes files to disk based on processed models.",
  "flows": "Modules are imported and executed to generate models; models are converted to meshes; if export option is enabled, meshes are saved to disk as .glb files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious network activity detected. Usage of dynamic imports is typical for plugin-like systems but could be abused if malicious modules are placed in directory.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules dynamically and executes a 'run' method from each, converting the result into a mesh. It supports optional export of models to .glb files. No untrusted input sources (e.g., network, environment variables) are used beyond file system access. The mesh export process is straightforward, and there are no signs of hidden or malicious code. The dynamic import could pose risk if malicious modules are present, but this is typical for plugin systems and not inherently malicious. No malware behaviors such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or cryptomining are evident. The code appears to perform legitimate file processing and model conversion tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The script primarily processes and exports 3D models by dynamically importing modules and converting their output into meshes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The main security consideration is the use of dynamic imports which could be exploited if malicious modules are introduced into the directory, but this is a standard practice in plugin architectures and not malicious per se.",
