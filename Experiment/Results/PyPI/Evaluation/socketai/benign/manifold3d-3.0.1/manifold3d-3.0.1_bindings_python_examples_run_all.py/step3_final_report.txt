{
  "purpose": "Dynamically loads Python modules from the current directory, executes their run() function to generate models, converts models to meshes, and optionally exports them as .glb files.",
  "sources": "Modules in the current directory, specifically the invocation of module.run() and the sys.argv check for '-e'.",
  "sinks": "The export_mesh function writes .glb files to disk; module.run() outputs are used for mesh creation.",
  "flows": "Modules are imported and their run() outputs are passed to to_mesh(), then optionally exported via export_mesh().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; dynamic import of local modules is standard in plugin systems but could be exploited if malicious modules are added.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate 3D model processing with dynamic plugin loading. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The main risk stems from importing untrusted modules, which is a common pattern but could be exploited if malicious modules are introduced. The code's structure and operations are straightforward and align with typical plugin architectures. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected. The security risk score reflects the potential for malicious modules, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard plugin-based 3D model processing utility with no evidence of malicious activity. The primary security concern is the dynamic import of modules, which should be managed carefully in untrusted environments. Overall, the code is safe, and the risk is low but non-zero due to the plugin pattern.",
