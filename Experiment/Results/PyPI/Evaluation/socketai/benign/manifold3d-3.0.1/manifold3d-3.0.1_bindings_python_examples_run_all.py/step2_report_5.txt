  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Dynamically loads Python modules (*.py) from the current directory (excluding itself).\n- Calls `run()` on each module to generate a model.\n- Converts the model to a mesh via `to_mesh()`.\n- Optionally exports the mesh as a `.glb` file if `-e` argument is provided.\n- Uses standard libraries and the `trimesh` package.\n- No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The dynamic import is limited to local files, typical for plugin systems.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity.\n- The dynamic import is limited to local modules, which is common in plugin architectures.\n- The export process writes files to disk but does not execute untrusted code.\n- No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- All reports are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- They correctly identify the dynamic import pattern, the purpose, and the lack of malicious activity.\n- They note the potential risk of importing untrusted modules but correctly contextualize it as a standard plugin pattern.\n\n### Scores and their justifications:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: around 0.1–0.2\n- These scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The main security concern is the dynamic import of modules from the directory, which could be malicious if untrusted modules are added.\n- The code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n- Exporting models as `.glb` files is a legitimate operation.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, mainly due to dynamic import potential)\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- If the environment is untrusted, consider sandboxing or validating modules before import.\n- No changes needed to the scores; they are aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate 3D model processing utility with standard plugin-like dynamic module loading. No malware or malicious behavior is evident. The main security concern is the potential for malicious modules, but this is inherent to plugin systems and not specific to this code.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
