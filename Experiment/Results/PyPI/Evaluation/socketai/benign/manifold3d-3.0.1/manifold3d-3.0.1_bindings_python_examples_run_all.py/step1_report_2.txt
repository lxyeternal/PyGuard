  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports modules, processes 3D models, and optionally exports them as GLB files.",
  "sources": "Reading files in the current directory with glob, importing modules via importlib, receiving command line arguments, calling module.run(), and reading mesh properties.",
  "sinks": "Exporting meshes using trimesh.exchange.export.export_mesh, which writes to files; potential if mesh data is manipulated maliciously.",
  "flows": "Files in directory -> dynamic import of modules -> call run() method -> get model -> convert to mesh -> optionally export mesh as GLB file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code. Usage of dynamic import could be risky if untrusted modules are present, but this appears intended for plugin-like behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script lists Python files in its directory, imports them dynamically, and calls a 'run' method expected to return a model object with a 'to_mesh()' method. It optionally exports the resulting mesh as a GLB file. There is no evidence of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The only potentially risky behavior is dynamic module loading, which could be exploited if malicious modules are added, but this is typical in plugin architectures and not inherently malicious. The export process writes files but does not seem to execute untrusted code. Overall, the script appears to be a legitimate 3D model processing tool without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard 3D model processing script that loads modules dynamically, processes models, and exports them. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The main risk lies in running untrusted modules, which is a common pattern, but no malicious activity is evident from the code itself.",
