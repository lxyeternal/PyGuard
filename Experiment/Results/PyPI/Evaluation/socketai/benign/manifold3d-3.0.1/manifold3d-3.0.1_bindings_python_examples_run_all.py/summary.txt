  "conclusion": "The script is a standard plugin-based 3D model processing utility with no evidence of malicious activity. The primary security concern is the dynamic import of modules, which should be managed carefully in untrusted environments. Overall, the code is safe, and the risk is low but non-zero due to the plugin pattern."
