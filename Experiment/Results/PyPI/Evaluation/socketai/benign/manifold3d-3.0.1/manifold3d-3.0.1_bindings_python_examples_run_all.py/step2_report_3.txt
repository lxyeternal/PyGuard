  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Dynamically loads Python modules from the current directory (excluding itself).\n- Calls a `run()` method on each module to generate a model object.\n- Converts the model to a mesh via `to_mesh()`.\n- Optionally exports the mesh as a `.glb` file if the `-e` argument is provided.\n- No network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- The main concern is the dynamic import of potentially untrusted modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code's core functionality appears legitimate: processing 3D models and exporting them.\n- No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n- The dynamic import mechanism could be exploited if malicious modules are present, but this is a common pattern in plugin systems.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- They acknowledge the risk of importing untrusted modules but consider it acceptable in plugin architectures.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic are evident.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the potential risk of executing untrusted modules but not indicating an active threat.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign scores higher than 0.2, which seems appropriate given the analysis.\n- The primary concern is the dynamic import of modules, which could be exploited if malicious modules are added, but this is a standard pattern in plugin systems, not inherently malicious.\n\n### Consistency and Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' findings.\n- No changes needed unless new evidence of malicious modules or code is found.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (reflecting the potential risk of dynamic imports in untrusted environments)\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign and aligns with the reports' conclusions.** The main security consideration remains the trustworthiness of modules in the directory, but this is a known and accepted risk in plugin-like systems.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2  \n\nThis conservative estimate confirms the reports' findings: the code is not malicious, but caution should be exercised regarding the dynamic import of untrusted modules.",
