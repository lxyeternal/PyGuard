  "purpose": "Helper library for Flake8 plugins, providing base classes and utilities for AST analysis and error reporting.",
  "sources": "import statements (ast, abc, typing), class definitions, method implementations",
  "sinks": "error reporting via self.errors.append in report_error method",
  "flows": "Node processing in report_error() adds errors to self.errors; run() method traverses AST and yields errors",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns; no obfuscated code; no network, file, or system manipulation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base plugin framework for Flake8, including an AST visitor and plugin class with abstract properties. It uses standard Python libraries and typical design patterns for static code analysis tools. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; error collection and reporting are straightforward. No anomalies such as obfuscated code or hidden functionalities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of a Flake8 plugin framework. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a well-structured utility module for static code analysis.",
