{
  "purpose": "A helper library for Flake8 plugins, providing base classes and utilities for AST analysis and error reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions, imports modules, and processes an AST passed to the Plugin class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process user input or network data.",
  "flows": "The code creates visitor instances to traverse the AST and reports errors; no external data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code appears standard for a static analysis plugin.",
  "analysis": "The script defines utility classes for static analysis: Visitor and Plugin, utilizing standard libraries ast, typing, and abc. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity is present. The code is structured to support plugin development and includes typical documentation and licensing comments. There are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard implementation of base classes for Flake8 plugins. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. The code is safe for use and review.",
