  "purpose": "A helper library for Flake8 plugins to perform static code analysis on Python ASTs.",
  "sources": "The code reads the AST of a Python script for analysis purposes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "The code creates visitor objects to traverse ASTs and collects errors, but no external data flows or malicious actions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Flake8 plugin base, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes for AST analysis, including a Visitor class for error collection and an abstract Plugin class. It employs standard patterns without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present; it functions as intended for static analysis tooling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a base framework for Flake8 plugins. It does not contain malware, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
