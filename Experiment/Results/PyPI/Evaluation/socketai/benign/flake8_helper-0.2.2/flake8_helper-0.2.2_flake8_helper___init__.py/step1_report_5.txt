{
  "purpose": "This code provides a base implementation for Flake8 plugin development, including AST node visitation and error reporting mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Reads the abstract syntax tree (AST) of Python code during static analysis.",
  "sinks": "Error reporting appends data to an errors list; no external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "AST traversal via Visitor class populates errors; Plugin class uses visitor to identify issues during run().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears standard for static analysis plugins.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes for AST node analysis without executing external code, network operations, or handling untrusted input directly. It employs type annotations and abstract base classes. No malicious or suspicious patterns detected; the code is a standard framework for static analysis plugins.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign framework for developing Flake8 plugins. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
