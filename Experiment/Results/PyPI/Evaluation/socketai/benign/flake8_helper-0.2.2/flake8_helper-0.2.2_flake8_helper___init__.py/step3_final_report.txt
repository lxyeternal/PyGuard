  "purpose": "A helper library for Flake8 plugins providing base classes and utilities for AST analysis.",
  "sources": "AST nodes during traversal, error reporting via self.errors list",
  "sinks": "Error list collection; no external data handling or untrusted input processing",
  "flows": "AST traversal via visitor.visit(self._tree), errors appended to self.errors, errors yielded in run()",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, well-structured, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard framework for static analysis plugins, including an AST visitor class and an abstract plugin base class. It uses common Python libraries and patterns, with no network, file, or external data interactions. Error collection is internal, and the code is purely structural, intended for subclassing. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising features are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for Flake8 plugin development, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and accurate.",
