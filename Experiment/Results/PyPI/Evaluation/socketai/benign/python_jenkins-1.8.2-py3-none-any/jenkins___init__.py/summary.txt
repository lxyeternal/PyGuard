  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Jenkins API client with features that could be exploited if misused, particularly the 'run_script()' method. No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0. The security risk score should be around 0.8 due to the powerful script execution capability, which warrants caution in environments with untrusted inputs."
