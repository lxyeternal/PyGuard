  "purpose": "A comprehensive Python API client for Jenkins, enabling management of jobs, nodes, views, plugins, credentials, and script execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for configuration, network responses from Jenkins API endpoints, user inputs for script execution.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Jenkins server, environment variables, logs, and script execution outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources include environment variables and user inputs; flows lead to network requests, script execution, and configuration management.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected. The 'run_script()' method executes arbitrary Groovy scripts, which is a powerful feature but potentially risky if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate Jenkins API client with extensive management capabilities. It includes a method 'run_script()' that executes arbitrary Groovy scripts on Jenkins master or nodes, which can be exploited if inputs are untrusted. Environment variables like 'PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY=0' disable SSL verification, posing security risks. No embedded malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's structure and comments indicate intended management functions. The potential for misuse of 'run_script()' justifies a high security risk score, but the code itself is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Jenkins API client with features that could be exploited if misused, particularly the 'run_script()' method. No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0. The security risk score should be around 0.8 due to the powerful script execution capability, which warrants caution in environments with untrusted inputs.",
