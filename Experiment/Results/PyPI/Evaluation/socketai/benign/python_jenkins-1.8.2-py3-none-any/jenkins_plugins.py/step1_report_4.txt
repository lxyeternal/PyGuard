{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and functions for managing and comparing Jenkins plugin versions, including legacy version parsing.",
  "sources": "Imports 'operator' and 're' modules; reads input from constructor arguments ('version') for Plugin and PluginVersion classes.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data sinks for untrusted input or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input version data flows into Plugin and PluginVersion objects, where it is parsed, stored, and compared; no external or network data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The version parsing functions handle version strings but do not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures and comparison methods for plugin versions, with regex-based version parsing. It includes standard licensing notices and adheres to version comparison logic. There are no signs of malicious code such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a legitimate version management utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of version parsing and comparison for Jenkins plugins, with no evidence of malware or security risks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors identified.",
