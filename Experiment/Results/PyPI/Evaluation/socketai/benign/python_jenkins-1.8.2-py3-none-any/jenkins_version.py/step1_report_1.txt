  "purpose": "Defines version information for the 'jenkins' package using the 'pbr' library.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'pbr.version' module and creates a VersionInfo object for 'jenkins'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data can lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pbr.version' -> instantiation of VersionInfo with 'jenkins'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a standard library and creates a version info object, which is typical for packaging. No data is being read from external sources or untrusted inputs. No obfuscated code, no malicious functions, or unusual control flow. It is a minimal, standard version declaration setup for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign part of a package's setup process. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
