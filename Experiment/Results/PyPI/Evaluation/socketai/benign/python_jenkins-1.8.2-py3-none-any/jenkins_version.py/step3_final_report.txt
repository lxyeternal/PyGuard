  "purpose": "The code defines version information for the 'jenkins' package using the 'pbr' library, serving as a minimal setup snippet for package version management.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pbr.version' module and creation of 'VersionInfo' object for 'jenkins'.",
  "sinks": "No external data output, network activity, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pbr.version' leads to creation of 'VersionInfo' object; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard package versioning snippet that imports a known library and creates a version info object. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network communication, or handle untrusted input. All security signals indicate benign intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. It is a typical package setup snippet for version management, and the scores accurately reflect its safe nature.",
