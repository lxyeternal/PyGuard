  "purpose": "Static analysis utility for detecting secrets in code files using pattern and entropy rules, supporting exclusions and inline 'nosecret' comments.",
  "sources": "File.read() method reading file content; regex parsing of inline comments for 'nosecret' directives.",
  "sinks": "Generation of Issue objects indicating detected secrets; no external network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Source: file content read; flow: pattern/entropy matching; sink: Issue creation and optional logging.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious external activity; standard handling of inline 'nosecret' comments; logs secret content at info level.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard static secret detection with support for exclusions and inline directives. It reads file content, applies pattern and entropy rules, and generates issues accordingly. No external network calls, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious code are present. The handling of 'nosecret' comments and logging is typical for such tools. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward analysis and absence of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate secret detection utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is very low, and the malware score correctly indicates no malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
