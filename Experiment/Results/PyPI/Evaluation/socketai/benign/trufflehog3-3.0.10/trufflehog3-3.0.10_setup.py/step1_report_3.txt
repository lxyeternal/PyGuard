{
  "purpose": "The code is for configuring the setup and distribution of a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md and requirements.txt files, importing package metadata (__NAME__, __VERSION__), and reading the current directory for setup.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function does not contain any insecure sinks; it primarily configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads package info and dependencies from files, then passes this data to setup() which manages the package distribution process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The email address appears to be personal but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports package metadata and reads external files (README and requirements). It then calls setup() with this data to configure package distribution. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Python package setup scripts. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or security vulnerabilities within this code fragment.",
