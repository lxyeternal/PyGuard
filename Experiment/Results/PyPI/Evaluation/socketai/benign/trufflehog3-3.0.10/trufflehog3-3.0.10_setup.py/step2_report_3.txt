  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound; no untrusted data or malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies this as a benign setup script.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The script uses package variables and reads files in a typical manner.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is accurate; no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code reads static files and sets up package metadata without any suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning aligns with standard practices.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** Well-founded.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a straightforward setup script.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code performs typical package setup tasks without suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Justified.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code content:** The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It reads static files, imports package metadata, and calls `setup()` with these parameters.  \n- **Malware risk:** None detected. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None present. The code is straightforward and readable.  \n- **Security risk:** Given the absence of untrusted input, network calls, or hidden behaviors, the risk score should remain very low.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal risk, but 0 is justified here)\n\n**Note:** All reports correctly identified the code as benign. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring aligns with this assessment.",
