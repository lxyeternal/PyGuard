  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named trufflehog3, intended to distribute the package with necessary metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading of the current file path (__file__), reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt', importing __NAME__ and __VERSION__ from trufflehog3 module.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function and its parameters, especially any use of untrusted or dynamic input (none detected here).",
  "flows": "Reading files and importing package variables to configure the setup process; no untrusted data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments. The code appears straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for packaging a Python project, including reading static files and package variables. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No external data or user input is processed at runtime that could be exploited. All steps follow typical setup script patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
