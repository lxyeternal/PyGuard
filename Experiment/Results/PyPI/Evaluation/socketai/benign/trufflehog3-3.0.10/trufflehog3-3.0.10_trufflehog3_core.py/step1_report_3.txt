{
  "purpose": "The code implements core logic for scanning repositories for secrets or sensitive data, loading and saving configurations and rules, and rendering results in various formats.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include files read via Path.read_text(), sys.stdin.read(), and YAML files for configuration and rules; also, input files for load functions.",
  "sinks": "Output functions such as write() and sys.stdout.write() where data is written; file outputs for dumped data; YAML serialization; logging info and warnings.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from files or stdin, parsed into models, and then processed through scanning functions. Results are rendered to strings or files. Configs and rules are loaded from files, influencing scan behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. Usage of multiprocessing is standard. YAML loading and dumping are typical. No obfuscated or unusual code structures; standard library usage. No suspicious network or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration loading, rule loading, and scanning operations, utilizing multiprocessing for parallelism. It carefully filters rules based on severity and user settings. Data flows from file reads into models, then through scan functions, with results rendered in various formats. No evidence of malicious data manipulation or hidden backdoors. Logging is used for info and warnings. No external network connections, system modifications, or obfuscated code are present. Functions are well-structured with standard patterns, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical core logic implementation for a secrets scanning tool. It loads configurations and rules, performs scans in parallel, and outputs results, all using standard libraries and practices. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. The code appears safe and purpose-driven without hidden or harmful behaviors.",
