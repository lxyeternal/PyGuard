  "purpose": "Core logic for a Python security scanning tool, handling configuration, rule loading, directory and git iteration, scanning, and rendering issues.",
  "sources": "File reading for configuration and rules, directory and git iterators for target files, YAML parsing for config and rules, multiprocessing for parallel scanning.",
  "sinks": "Rendering functions output issues; file write operations for dumping data; YAML deserialization for config and rules; multiprocessing for parallel execution.",
  "flows": "Configuration and rules are loaded from files or stdin, then passed to scan functions. Files are iterated from directories or git, then processed by search, with issues collected and rendered.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, standard library usage, safe YAML parsing, and multiprocessing. No hardcoded secrets or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration loading, rule management, directory and git iteration, parallel scanning, and rendering. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. YAML.safe_load is used, which is safe. Multiprocessing and file I/O are common and properly handled. No suspicious patterns or anomalous code segments detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured core component of a security scanning utility, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to standard practices in YAML parsing and multiprocessing, which are acceptable in this context.",
