{
  "purpose": "The code provides core logic for scanning repositories for secrets or sensitive data, loading configurations/rules, and rendering/dumping results.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, rules files, YAML data, and target directories/files for scanning.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to files or stdout; loads YAML from files or stdin; reads configuration and rules from specified paths.",
  "flows": "Configuration/rules files are loaded from disk, then scan function processes files/directories, possibly in parallel, generating issues. Results are rendered or dumped to files or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard libraries appears benign. No network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules, defines functions for scanning, diffing issues, loading configurations/rules, and rendering output. The scan function reads files/directories, filters rules, and uses multiprocessing to search for issues. Loading functions parse YAML files for configs/rules/models. Rendering functions output results in various formats. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. No suspicious patterns or anomalies found. The overall code appears to be standard for a static analysis/security scanning tool.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard core logic implementation for a secret scanning tool. It loads configurations and rules, scans directories/files for issues, and renders results. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. It adheres to expected patterns without obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
