  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for the trufflehog3 security tool, orchestrating configuration loading, repository cloning, scanning, and report rendering.",
  "sources": "CLI arguments, URLs for repositories, configuration files, rules files, previous scan files",
  "sinks": "File output for reports, repository cloning via git, in-memory data structures for issues",
  "flows": "CLI inputs → configuration loading and repository cloning → scanning process → report rendering",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard command-line interface that manages argument parsing, configuration, repository cloning, and report rendering. It uses safe, well-understood libraries and patterns. Repository cloning from URLs is expected for a security scanner, not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scoring aligns with the benign nature of the script, with malware score 0, obfuscation score 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) due to potential misuse of URL inputs, which is inherent to the tool's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured CLI for a security scanning tool with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score appropriately reflects the potential for malicious URLs but does not indicate inherent malicious activity. All evidence points to a safe, standard implementation.",
