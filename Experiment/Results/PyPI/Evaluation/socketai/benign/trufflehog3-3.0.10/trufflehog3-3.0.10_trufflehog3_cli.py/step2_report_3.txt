  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings, scores, and reasoning to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds the code to be a legitimate CLI for a security tool, no malicious activity, well-structured.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious activity detected. The low risk score reflects the benign nature. The malware score is correctly 0, given no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, confirms standard operations, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with report 1. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The risk score remains low, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a straightforward CLI wrapper, no malicious behavior, standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score (0.1), which aligns with the absence of suspicious activity. The malware score remains 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious activity, standard operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** No issues here. The risk score is appropriate, and malware score is 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms a legitimate CLI, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Highest confidence and zero risk/malware scores, which is consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Consistency and Recommendations:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard CLI for a security tool, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- The risk scores are low (0 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n- Confidence levels are high, aligning with the clear, standard code structure.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0, since no malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the cloning of repositories from URLs, the only potential concern is if malicious URLs are supplied. However, this is inherent to the tool's purpose and not a flaw in the code itself. Therefore, a low risk score (around 0.1–0.2) is appropriate.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since remote cloning could be exploited if malicious URLs are used, but this is a known and expected behavior for such tools)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary. The code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious elements.",
