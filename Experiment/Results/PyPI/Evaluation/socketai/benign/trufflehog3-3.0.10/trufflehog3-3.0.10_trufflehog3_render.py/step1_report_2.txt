  "purpose": "Render issues in text, JSON, and HTML formats for reporting.",
  "sources": "Importing data from external Issue objects, reading template files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Rendering templates, dumping JSON data.",
  "flows": "Issues data flows from input Issue objects to rendered output via templates and JSON serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Use of external libraries appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for rendering issue reports in different formats using jinja2 templates and json serialization. It processes Issue objects and their attributes, and loads templates from the filesystem. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code relies on standard libraries and trusted external modules for rendering. No signs of malicious or sabotage code are detected. The import statements and file loading are standard; no suspicious dynamic behaviors or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward report rendering module with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided source. The implementation appears safe and intended for legitimate reporting purposes.",
