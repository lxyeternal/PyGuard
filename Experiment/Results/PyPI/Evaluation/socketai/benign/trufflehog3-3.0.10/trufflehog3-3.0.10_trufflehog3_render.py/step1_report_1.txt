{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to render security issues or alerts in various formats (text, JSON, HTML) for reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an iterable of Issue objects, which are passed as arguments to functions like text(), json(), and html().",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with the file system via jinja2 file loaders to load templates; it also serializes data into JSON format. There are no dangerous data sinks that lead to remote data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Issues are read from input arguments, processed (sorted, grouped), and then rendered into string formats (text, JSON, HTML) via templates or serialization functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code, is detected. Usage of external libraries (jinja2, json) is standard. The functions include descriptive docstrings and examples but no unsafe code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data processing and rendering for issue reporting using jinja2 templates. It reads input data from provided Issue objects, sorts and groups them internally, then outputs formatted strings. The code uses safe serialization (json.dumps with default=str) and standard templating practices. No dynamic execution, network communication, or manipulation of environment variables is present. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate report rendering module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It securely processes and formats issue data for reporting purposes. No suspicious or malicious code elements are found.",
