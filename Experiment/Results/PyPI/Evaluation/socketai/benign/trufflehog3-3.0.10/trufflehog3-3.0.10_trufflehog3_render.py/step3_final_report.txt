  "purpose": "Render security issues reports in text, JSON, and HTML formats using templates and data from Issue objects.",
  "sources": "Reads Issue objects, loads templates from filesystem, and serializes data with json.dumps.",
  "sinks": "Template rendering and JSON serialization; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Issue data -> template rendering or JSON dump -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign report rendering utility that loads templates, sorts and groups issues, and outputs formatted reports. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Usage of jinja2 and json is standard and safe. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to filesystem template loading, but no vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), aligning with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard report rendering utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores and assessments in all reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
