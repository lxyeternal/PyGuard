{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to render security issues detected in code analysis into various formats (text, JSON, HTML) for reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads issues from iterable inputs, primarily Issue objects and related classes; no external untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Uses templating engines (jinja2) to generate output; no untrusted data is directly written to external systems or files within this code segment.",
  "flows": "Issue objects are sorted and passed into templates for rendering. The report data structures are prepared internally and used for HTML rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present. The code uses external libraries responsibly.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads templates and renders issues data into different formats. It leverages safe templating practices with autoescape settings. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are straightforward and focused on data formatting. No input validation or external data sources are directly involved, reducing attack surface. Overall, the code appears to be a safe reporting module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, safe reporting utility for security issues. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It relies on external libraries for templating and data handling, but these are used in a typical manner. The code is clean, with no anomalies suggesting malicious intent.",
