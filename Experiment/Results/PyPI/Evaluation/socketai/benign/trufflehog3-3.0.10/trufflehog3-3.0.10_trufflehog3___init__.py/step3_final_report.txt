  "purpose": "Setup module for trufflehog3, defining constants, regex patterns, and logging configuration for secret detection.",
  "sources": "Internal configuration variables, regex pattern for inline 'nosecret' comments, helper.logger() for logging.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration and regex compilation are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern matching regex, no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup module with constants, regex for comment detection, and a debug toggle function. No data is read from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. The regex is used for internal comment annotation, a common pattern in secret detection tools. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The logger is an internal utility, and the code structure is clean and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The regex pattern is a standard comment detection pattern, not exploitable or malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for inclusion in projects.",
