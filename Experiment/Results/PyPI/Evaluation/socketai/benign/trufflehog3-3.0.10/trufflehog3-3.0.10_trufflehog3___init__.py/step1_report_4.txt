  "purpose": "Main module for the trufflehog3 tool, setting up configurations, constants, and a regex for inline 'nosecret' comments.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, the script file itself, and the 'helper' module for logging.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions, regex matching, and configuration variables. No apparent data leaks or insecure data handling.",
  "flows": "Code reads configuration and helper modules, compiles regex, sets logging levels based on input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. The regex for 'nosecret' comments is straightforward and used for documentation or pattern suppression, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes constants, logging, and a regex pattern to detect inline 'nosecret' comments, likely used for internal code annotation. It defines a function to toggle debug logging levels. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, no command execution, or network activity. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior identified. All components appear standard for a configuration or setup script, with no malicious payloads or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears benign, focused on configuration and logging setup with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
