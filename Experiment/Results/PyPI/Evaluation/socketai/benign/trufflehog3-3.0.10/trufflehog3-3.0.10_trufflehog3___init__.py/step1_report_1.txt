  "purpose": "Main module setup and configuration for trufflehog3, including constants, regex patterns, and logging setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (logging, re, pathlib), helper module, and reading file paths and configurations.",
  "sinks": "Logging calls via helper.logger(), regex pattern compilation (NOSECRET_INLINE_RE).",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources are directly read or passed within this snippet. The regex could process comments or code if supplied, but no explicit data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code are evident in the provided fragment. The regex appears to detect inline 'nosecret' comments, which is standard for secret detection tools.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines constants and regex for secret detection, and provides a function to toggle debug mode. It does not contain any network communication, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The regex is used to identify inline 'nosecret' comments, a common pattern for secret management. Logging setup appears standard, with no sensitive data handling or obfuscated code. No suspicious flows or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard initialization for a secret detection tool, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It primarily sets up configurations, constants, and logging, with no evidence of malware or security threats.",
