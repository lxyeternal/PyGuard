  "purpose": "Main module initialization and configuration setup for the trufflehog3 security scanning tool.",
  "sources": "File system paths (Path objects), regex pattern for inline 'nosecret' comments, helper module functions, module metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling points identified in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No specific data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets constants and configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of regex for comment parsing is standard; no obfuscated code, no malicious imports or function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, configuration files, and a regex pattern for inline 'nosecret' comments, which are used to flag sections of code where secrets should be omitted from scanning. It imports standard libraries and a helper module without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No input or untrusted data sources are processed. No sinks, such as network or file writes, are present. Overall, this is standard setup code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly setting configuration and parsing rules for secret comments. There are no indicators of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment.",
