{
  "purpose": "Define data models, rules, and configurations for a security scanning tool that detects sensitive information in code files.",
  "sources": "File.read() method reads file content; class initializers and static methods process input data; helper functions (e.g., get_strings, shannon_entropy) called within rules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data used in regex matching, string processing, or file reading; issues could arise if malicious input is processed in a way that leads to code execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data (file content or rule definitions) flows through rule findall methods which compile regex or analyze entropy, then matches are collected and stored in Issue objects; Issue IDs are generated via UUID based on file path and secret.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external import 'trufflehog3' indicates reliance on external package; no explicit hardcoded credentials or secret strings present; code does not contain obvious backdoors or hidden code. Pattern and entropy rules are standard and do not exhibit obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models for files, rules, issues, and configurations, primarily using attrs for immutability and structure. Rule classes include pattern matching and entropy detection, which are typical for security scans. The use of UUID3 for issue and rule IDs is standard. File reading involves exception handling but no unsafe code. External package 'trufflehog3' is imported but not detailed here; no suspicious network activity or system commands are present. The code focuses on data processing and rule application, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data models and rule definitions for a security scanning tool; it does not contain malicious code or behavior. The logic is standard for pattern and entropy-based detection. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within this code fragment.",
