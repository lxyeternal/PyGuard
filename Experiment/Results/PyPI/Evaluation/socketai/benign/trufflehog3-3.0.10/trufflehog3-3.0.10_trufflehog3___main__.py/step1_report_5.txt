{
  "purpose": "Run the trufflehog3 tool as a Python module, invoking its CLI functionality.",
  "sources": "Importing 'cli' from the 'trufflehog3' package, and calling 'cli.run()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'cli.run()' function may execute command-line operations or process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Import 'cli', then execute 'cli.run()' which likely triggers command-line parsing and execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and only invokes existing CLI functionality without any suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports and executes the 'run' method from the 'cli' module of 'trufflehog3'. It acts as a wrapper to run the tool as a module, which is standard. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or hidden data exfiltration. The code relies entirely on the 'trufflehog3' package's internal functions, which are assumed to be legitimate. No hardcoded secrets, unsafe code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic wrapper for executing 'trufflehog3' via its CLI module. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident from this minimal implementation. It is a benign utility script.",
