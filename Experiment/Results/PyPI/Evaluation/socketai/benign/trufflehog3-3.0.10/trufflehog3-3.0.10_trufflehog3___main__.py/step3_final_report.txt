{
  "purpose": "A minimal wrapper that imports the 'cli' module from 'trufflehog3' and executes 'cli.run()' to invoke the CLI programmatically.",
  "sources": "Importing 'cli' from 'trufflehog3' and calling 'cli.run()'. No other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The 'cli.run()' function may process command-line arguments or user input, potentially leading to execution of untrusted data within the 'trufflehog3' package.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'cli' to executing 'cli.run()', delegating control to the external package's CLI logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward wrapper with no embedded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard wrapper that imports and executes 'cli.run()' from the 'trufflehog3' package. It does not handle user input directly, nor does it contain any malicious or obfuscated code. The security implications depend entirely on the internal implementation of 'cli.run()' within 'trufflehog3', which is outside the scope of this snippet. The code itself is benign and does not perform any network, file, or malicious operations. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The small security risk score (~0.2) reflects the potential for 'cli.run()' to process untrusted input, but this is external to the wrapper code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, minimal wrapper that delegates execution to the 'trufflehog3' CLI module. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the internal implementation of 'cli.run()'. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
