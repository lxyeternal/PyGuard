{
  "purpose": "This code provides helper functions for logging, string processing, and entropy calculation, primarily for use in debugging, analysis, or data processing.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external inputs or data sources within these functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the functions do not contain any operations that output untrusted data or perform external actions like network communication or file writing.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs leading to security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The color codes, logger setup, and string processing appear standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: a color class for ANSI codes, a logger setup function with formatted output, functions for extracting lines and context from strings, extracting substrings based on character sets, and calculating Shannon entropy. All functions perform standard operations with no external data input, network activity, or code execution. The logging setup uses color codes for levels, but this is typical for debugging purposes. The string processing functions are straightforward, and entropy calculation is a common statistical measure. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. No hidden code or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions for logging and string analysis. There are no indications of malicious activity, supply chain threats, or malicious code sabotage. It appears safe and intended for debugging or data analysis tasks.",
