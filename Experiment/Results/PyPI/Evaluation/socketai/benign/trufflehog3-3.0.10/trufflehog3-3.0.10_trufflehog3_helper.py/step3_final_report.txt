  "purpose": "Utility functions for logging, colored output, string line extraction, substring extraction, and Shannon entropy calculation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions such as strings, color codes, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; functions operate on inputs only.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to parameter processing within functions; no external or network data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of benign utility functions with straightforward implementations. No external data access, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The logging setup uses standard practices with color coding, and string processing functions perform simple operations without security issues. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are evident. The code is safe and intended for utility purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
