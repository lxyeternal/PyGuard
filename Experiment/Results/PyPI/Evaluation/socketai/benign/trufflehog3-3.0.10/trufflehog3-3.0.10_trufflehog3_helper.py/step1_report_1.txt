{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for logging, colored output, and string processing including line extraction, substring extraction, and Shannon entropy calculation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from string parameters in functions like get_lines, get_strings, and shannon_entropy.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects. The functions are utility in nature and do not perform network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed within functions to extract lines, substrings, or compute entropy, with no external data flows or outputs beyond return values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. Logging setup is standard. The code does not execute dynamic code or access sensitive environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for logging, text processing, and entropy calculation. The logger function configures a singleton logger with colored levels. get_lines extracts specific lines with context. get_strings extracts substrings composed of specified characters exceeding a minimum length. shannon_entropy calculates the Shannon entropy based on character frequency. All functions are self-contained, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions intended for string processing and logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
