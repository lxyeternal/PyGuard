{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for color formatting, logging setup, string line extraction, substring extraction, and entropy calculation.",
  "sources": "None; all functions operate on provided input parameters and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flow to external systems or sensitive data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows involving untrusted input leading to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets (besides ANSI color codes and logger names), or obfuscation detected. The logger function modifies global logging configuration but does not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for color output, logging configuration, text processing, and entropy calculation. All functions operate on parameters or internal data without external input that could lead to injection or data exfiltration. The logger function sets up logging handlers and formatters with color coding, but does not perform network communication or access sensitive environment variables. The string manipulation functions simply process text data; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation mechanisms are used. The code appears to be benign utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of harmless utility functions for formatting, logging, and string analysis. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected.",
