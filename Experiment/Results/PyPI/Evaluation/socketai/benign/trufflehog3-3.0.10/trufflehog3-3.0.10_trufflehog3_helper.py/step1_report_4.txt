{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for colored logging, extracting lines and substrings from text, and calculating Shannon entropy.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data inputs are explicitly read in this code; functions operate on provided string parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; functions perform benign text processing and logging setup.",
  "flows": "The code initializes logging, processes input strings, and computes entropy, but does not transfer data externally or execute untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated logic. Logging setup is standard, and string processing functions do not perform unsafe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for colored logging, extracting lines with context, extracting substrings of specific alphabet characters, and calculating Shannon entropy. The logger function sets up a singleton logger with formatted levels, but does not include any network communication or sensitive data handling. String manipulation functions operate on passed parameters without external data access or side effects. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The code appears to be benign and intended for aiding in logging and text analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code is safe, primarily consisting of utility functions for logging and text processing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
