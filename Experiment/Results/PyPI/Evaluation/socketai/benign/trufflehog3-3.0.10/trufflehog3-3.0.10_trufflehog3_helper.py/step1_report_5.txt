{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for colored logging, line extraction, substring extraction based on character sets, and entropy calculation.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external input; they operate on passed parameters like strings, log levels, and color options.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions send data to the logging system; no untrusted data handling occurs that could lead to injection or leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; functions process data locally and return results without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present; the code consists solely of utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper utilities for coloring console output, configuring loggers, extracting specific lines with context from text, extracting substrings of specified character sets, and calculating string entropy. All functions operate solely on provided input parameters. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. The use of color in logging is purely for display purposes. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
