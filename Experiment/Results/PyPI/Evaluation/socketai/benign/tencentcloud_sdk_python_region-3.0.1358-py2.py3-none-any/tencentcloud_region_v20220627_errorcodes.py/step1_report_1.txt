{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants for error codes related to parameter validation, rate limiting, and unsupported operations, likely used in an API or SDK for error handling.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions at the beginning of the code, which are not dependent on external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows to cause vulnerabilities; this code does not process or execute data from external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant string definitions for error messages. It does not perform any input handling, data processing, or external calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or backdoors. The structure and content are typical for error code definitions in software SDKs or APIs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and standard code snippet defining error constants. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
