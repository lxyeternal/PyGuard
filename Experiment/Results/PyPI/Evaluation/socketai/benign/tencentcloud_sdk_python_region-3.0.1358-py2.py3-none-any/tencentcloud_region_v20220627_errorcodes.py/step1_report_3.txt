{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants for error codes and messages used in an API or SDK for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "None (static string constants)",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing or output based on untrusted input)",
  "flows": "No data flow or data manipulation occurs; these are static definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license headers and static string variable assignments for error codes, typical in API SDKs. There are no dynamic or user-input-dependent components, nor any network operations, file access, or secret handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of error constants used for API error handling. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and appears to be a benign part of a larger SDK or application.",
