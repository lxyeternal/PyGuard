{
  "purpose": "The code defines constants representing various error codes for a Tencent API SDK, used for handling error responses.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; constants are hardcoded string values.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data processing or data leak points; no sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual coding practices are present. The code contains licensing comments and simple constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static constant definitions for error codes related to API parameter errors, request limits, and unsupported operations. No input handling, no dynamic code, no network or file operations, and no malicious patterns are present. The license and copyright comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for API error codes, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is benign and purely informational.",
