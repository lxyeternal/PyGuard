  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a simple set of constant string definitions for error codes related to API or SDK error handling.\n   - It contains licensing comments and static string assignments.\n   - There are no input processing, data flows, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for defining error constants.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies:**\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or data leakage.\n   - The code is benign and typical for SDK or API error handling modules.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that this is a benign constants definition file.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are present in the code snippet.\n\n5. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The scores given (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n   - The code is entirely benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the current scoring:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is a standard, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated constants definition file for error codes. The scores reflect its benign nature accurately.",
