  "review": "Let's review the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static constant string definitions for error codes, with no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears benign and standard for error handling in SDKs or APIs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of data flows, external input handling, or suspicious patterns. No logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty in their assessment. These scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely static constant definitions with no dynamic or external behavior, there is no justification for a high risk score. The reports' scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the static nature of the code and its benign purpose.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a straightforward, benign set of constant definitions for error codes, with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the current scoring and conclusions. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores correctly reflect its benign nature.",
