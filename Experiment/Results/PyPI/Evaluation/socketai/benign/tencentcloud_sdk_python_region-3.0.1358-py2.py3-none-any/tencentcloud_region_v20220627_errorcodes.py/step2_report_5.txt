  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:  \n   The code is a straightforward set of constant string definitions for error codes, including `INVALIDPARAMETER`, `INVALIDPARAMETER_PARAMETERERROR`, `REQUESTLIMITEXCEEDED`, and `UNSUPPORTEDOPERATION`. It contains licensing headers and no dynamic logic, input handling, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious patterns. The code is typical for an SDK or API error handling module.\n\n3. **Potential Risks and Data Flows**:  \n   Since the code only defines constants, there are no data flows, sinks, or sources that could lead to vulnerabilities. No input validation, data processing, or external calls are present.\n\n4. **Scores Justification**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - **Purpose and Analysis**: The purpose is solely to define constants, which is a common and safe practice.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are reasonable, and the analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   Since the code is static, there's no reason to suspect hidden malicious behavior. The licensing header is standard and does not raise concerns.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates** align with the reports: the code is entirely benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis code is a standard, safe constants definition for error handling in an SDK or API. No further action or concern is necessary.",
