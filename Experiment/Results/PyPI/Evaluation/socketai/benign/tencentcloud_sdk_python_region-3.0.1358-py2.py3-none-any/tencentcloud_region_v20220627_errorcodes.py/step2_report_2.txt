  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static string constant definitions for error codes.\n   - There are no data flows, no input handling, no external data processing, and no dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is straightforward, with standard licensing comments and error code constants.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Anomalies:**\n   - No report detects any obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file access, or secret handling.\n   - No signs of backdoors, data leakage, or malicious code are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Flaws:**\n   - The only possible concern could be if these constants were injected maliciously or if the file was tampered with. However, the reports do not suggest any such anomalies.\n   - The code appears to be part of a standard SDK or API error handling module, which is common and benign.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign constants definition file.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- I agree with the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and free of malware.\n- The scores should remain as they are: all indicating no risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, I concur that this code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.",
