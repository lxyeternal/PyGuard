  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the details:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static constant definitions for error codes/messages.\n- No external input, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is standard for SDK or API error handling modules.\n- The license headers are typical and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward, static string assignments.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources involving untrusted data.\n- No obfuscation or unusual coding practices.\n- The reports are consistent and concur that this is benign, standard code.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or below. The code is purely definitional; no vulnerabilities or security risks are evident.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since the code is just constants, it cannot be malicious or obfuscated unless it was tampered with after being reviewed.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (or 0.5 at most, but given the benign nature, 0 is appropriate)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is a standard, safe definition of error constants with no security concerns.",
