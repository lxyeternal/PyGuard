{
  "purpose": "Defines static error code constants for API or SDK error handling, serving as standard error identifiers.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static constant definitions with no input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any external operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static constants are used as identifiers without dynamic data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, readable constant definitions with standard licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants representing error codes, with licensing headers. It contains no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical for error handling modules in SDKs or APIs. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. No logical flaws or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of error code constants with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores accurately reflect its safe and straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
