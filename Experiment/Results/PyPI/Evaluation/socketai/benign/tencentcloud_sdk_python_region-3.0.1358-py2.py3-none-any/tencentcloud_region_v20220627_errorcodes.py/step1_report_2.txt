{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define constant string variables representing error or status codes, likely for use in an API or software SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string literals assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input is processed or output; the code only assigns and defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely defining constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and standard for error code definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a header with licensing and copyright notices, followed by the definition of several string constants representing different error or status messages. There are no input operations, no data processing, no dynamic execution, and no interaction with external systems or sensitive data. It appears to be a simple static definition module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard constants definition file with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It serves a benign purpose of defining error codes.",
