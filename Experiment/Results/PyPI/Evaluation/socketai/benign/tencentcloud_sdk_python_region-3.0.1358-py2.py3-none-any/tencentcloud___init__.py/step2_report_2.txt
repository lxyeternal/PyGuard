  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- The code is purely a header containing licensing comments, copyright notices, and a version variable assignment (`__version__ = '3.0.1358'`).\n- There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or any executable logic.\n- No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code is standard for open-source or proprietary Python packages, serving as metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code contains only comments and a version variable; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code.\n- They appropriately note the absence of data flows, sinks, anomalies, or obfuscation.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign content.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is only metadata, there is no basis for higher scores.\n- The consistent conclusion across reports supports that this is a standard, safe header.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is safe and typical for package headers.",
