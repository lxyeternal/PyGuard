  "review": "Let's review the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Code Content Summary:**\n- The code contains only licensing comments, copyright notices, and a single version assignment:\n  ```python\n  __version__ = '3.0.1358'\n  ```\n- No functions, data processing, network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.\n- The comments are standard licensing boilerplate, indicating open-source licensing under Apache 2.0, associated with Tencent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Malicious activity:** None. The code is purely metadata and comments.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None. No executable logic or data flows.\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, only containing licensing comments and a version variable.\n- The confidence level is high (1), and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Logical and Scoring Evaluation:\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code snippet is just a header, likely part of a larger package. If the rest of the package contains executable code, vulnerabilities or malicious behavior could exist elsewhere, but based solely on this snippet, there's no cause for concern.\n- The reports correctly identify that this is standard licensing metadata with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the content.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe provided code and reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, purely metadata, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. No modifications to the scores or analysis are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code content.",
