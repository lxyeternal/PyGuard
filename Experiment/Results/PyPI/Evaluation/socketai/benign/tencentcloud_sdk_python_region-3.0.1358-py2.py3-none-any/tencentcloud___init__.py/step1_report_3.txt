  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors detected; only licensing comments and a version variable",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment. There are no functions, input/output operations, or executable logic that could indicate malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard header for a Python source file, likely part of a larger codebase. No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks is present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment is benign, serving as a license and version declaration. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
