  "purpose": "This code serves as a licensing header and version metadata for the package, containing comments and a version string.",
  "sources": "Comments and the __version__ variable assignment",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static comments and a variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward licensing comments and version info",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a version variable assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, network calls, or obfuscation. It is standard metadata for a Python package. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code is human-readable, and the absence of data flows or external interactions indicates no security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero, with high confidence (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely metadata, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
