  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- The code contains only licensing comments and a single variable assignment:\n  ```python\n  __version__ = '3.0.1358'\n  ```\n- No functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The comments are standard licensing notices, copyright, and license info.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of malicious code or suspicious behavior:** None. The code is purely metadata.\n- **Obfuscation:** No. The code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Data flows or sinks:** None. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that this is just licensing and version metadata with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The reports uniformly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Malware:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — correct.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is only comments and a version variable, there is no reason to assign any higher risk scores.\n- The malware score is 0 because there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk is 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the code.\n- The code fragment appears to be a standard header or metadata section of a larger codebase.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
