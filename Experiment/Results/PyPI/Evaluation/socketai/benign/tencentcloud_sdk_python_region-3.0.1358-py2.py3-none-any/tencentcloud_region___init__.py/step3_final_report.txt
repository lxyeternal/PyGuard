  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns, focusing on code content, data sources, sinks, and flow.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, network responses, file reads, external libraries",
  "sinks": "Network requests, file writes, subprocess calls, logging, environment variables",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks through data processing functions, dynamic execution points like eval/exec",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec without sanitization, potential hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, unusual control flow",
  "analysis": "The code lacks explicit malicious payloads but contains risky practices such as eval/exec without input validation, which could be exploited. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is evident. The absence of code in some reports limits analysis. The use of eval/exec warrants cautious scoring, but without confirmed malicious intent, the likelihood remains low. The overall structure and flow do not indicate malicious sabotage, but the risky dynamic execution practices elevate the security concern slightly.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are accurate; the primary concern is the use of eval/exec without sanitization, which should be reflected in a slightly higher malware score. Given the evidence, the code does not appear malicious but has potential security risks. Scores are appropriate with minor adjustments to malware scoring in reports highlighting eval/exec practices.",
