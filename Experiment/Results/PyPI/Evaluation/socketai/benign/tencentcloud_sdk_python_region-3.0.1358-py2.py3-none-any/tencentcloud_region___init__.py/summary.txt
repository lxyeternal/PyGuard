  "conclusion": "Most reports are accurate; the primary concern is the use of eval/exec without sanitization, which should be reflected in a slightly higher malware score. Given the evidence, the code does not appear malicious but has potential security risks. Scores are appropriate with minor adjustments to malware scoring in reports highlighting eval/exec practices."
