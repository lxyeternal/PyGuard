  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to perform a specific function (not explicitly stated), likely involving data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, user inputs, or file reads within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands executed via subprocess or os.system.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs or environment variables) to sinks (network, files, or system commands), possibly through intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes dynamic execution (eval or exec), hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Check for unexplained network connections or data exfiltration attempts.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed step-by-step, noting any use of untrusted inputs, insecure practices such as unsanitized system calls, or suspicious network activity. No explicit malicious behavior, such as data theft or system damage, is evident from the visible code. However, hidden or obfuscated parts could pose risks. Use of environment variables or inputs should be scrutinized for leaks or misuse. The code structure appears standard, with no clear indicators of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not display clear malicious intent or suspicious behavior based on the provided content. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The overall security risk appears low, but some caution is advised if any obfuscated or hidden parts exist.",
