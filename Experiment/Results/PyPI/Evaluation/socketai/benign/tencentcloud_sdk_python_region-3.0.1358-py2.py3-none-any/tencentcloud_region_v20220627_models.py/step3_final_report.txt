  "purpose": "Data model classes for API request and response serialization/deserialization in Tencent Cloud SDK.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries in _deserialize methods, class property getters/setters.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of input data to class attributes; warnings for unused fields.",
  "flows": "Input data → _deserialize methods → class attributes",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in variable name 'memeber_set', benign and non-impactful.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward data classes with property decorators and simple _deserialize methods. No network activity, code execution, or malicious patterns are present. The only minor issue is a typo in 'memeber_set', which does not affect functionality or security. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. The warnings about unused fields are standard in SDK models. Overall, the code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate, with no malicious or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, non-malicious data model classes used for API communication. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The scores should remain at malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
