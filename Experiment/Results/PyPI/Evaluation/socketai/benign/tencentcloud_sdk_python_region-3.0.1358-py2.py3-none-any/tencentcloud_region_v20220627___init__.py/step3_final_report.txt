  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network communication, file operations, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, subprocess calls, environment variables, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into network communication or file operations; dynamic code execution may process untrusted data; data may be sent over network or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, dynamic code execution, unusual variable naming, inconsistent formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors associated with malicious activity if it contains eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, or network exfiltration. Suspicious patterns include obfuscation and dynamic execution. Benign code lacks these indicators. The confidence in malicious detection depends on actual code content; without code snippets, suspicion is based on report summaries. The highest risk is associated with code containing obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting malware score close to 1 if confirmed. Otherwise, scores should be lowered accordingly. The overall security risk aligns with the presence of suspicious behaviors, with high scores justified if malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code's malicious potential hinges on the presence of eval/exec, obfuscation, and network activity. Reports indicating such behaviors are justified in assigning high malware and risk scores. Benign reports are consistent with low scores. Without concrete code, a conservative approach assigns low scores, but suspicion remains if malicious patterns are confirmed. The overall assessment emphasizes cautious monitoring and further code review.",
