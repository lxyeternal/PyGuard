  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing a specific task, possibly involving data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly visible; if any, they might be from environment variables, files, or network calls (not shown explicitly).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls if present; however, none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow is observable within the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual constructs. There is no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward with standard syntax and no signs of malicious activity. It does not access or leak sensitive data, nor does it perform any network operations or system modifications. The lack of any suspicious patterns or anomalous behavior suggests it is benign. Since no external data sources, sinks, or flows are identifiable, it indicates a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The script seems to perform its intended function without engaging in any suspicious or harmful activities.",
