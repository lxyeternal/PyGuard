{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to [insert specific function based on code, e.g., data processing, API interaction, utility functions], as inferred from the functions and logic present.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input functions, environment variables, or file operations; specific sources depend on the code content, such as 'open()', 'os.environ', or 'sys.argv'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, subprocess calls, or use of eval/exec with untrusted data; specific sinks depend on the code details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks via variables and function calls; e.g., input data processed and then sent over network or written to disk.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, use of eval/exec on untrusted input, or obfuscated code patterns are noted. Without actual code snippets, specific anomalies cannot be identified.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common security issues such as hardcoded secrets, insecure data handling, malicious network activity, or obfuscation. No explicit malicious activity was evident in the structure provided. The presence of standard library functions alone is not suspicious unless combined with dangerous patterns like untrusted eval or network exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available analysis, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose, assuming no hidden or obfuscated components are present. Confidence is moderate due to the lack of specific code snippets but no immediate threats were identified.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
