{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'IMDbPY', used to package and distribute the project.",
  "sources": "Reads local 'README.md' file for long description; uses hardcoded version and URLs; imports 'setuptools' and 'os'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, database access, or dynamic code execution; only reads a local file.",
  "flows": "Reads local README.md -> passes metadata to setup() -> no external data flows or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, conventional setup script; no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for packaging a Python project. It imports standard libraries, reads a local README file, and calls 'setup()' with project metadata. There are no dynamic or network operations, no handling of untrusted input, and no suspicious code structures. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices indicate no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
