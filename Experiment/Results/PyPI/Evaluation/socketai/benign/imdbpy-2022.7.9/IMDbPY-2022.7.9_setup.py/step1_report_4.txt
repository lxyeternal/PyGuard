{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the Python package IMDbPY, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; reading the current file path to locate README.md",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not execute untrusted input or perform unsafe operations",
  "flows": "N/A; straightforward reading of local files and setup configuration without untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed; the version is hardcoded but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and reads the README.md file to include a long description, which is a common pattern for Python package setup scripts. It specifies package metadata such as name, description, version, dependencies, and URLs. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code is simple and directly related to package setup, with no external data inputs beyond local files and no execution of untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
