{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging and distributing the IMDbPY project, primarily used for defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or used in a potentially harmful way",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content as long_description, passing dependencies and metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual variables.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions for package configuration. It reads a local README.md file for description, which is a typical pattern. There are no external inputs from untrusted sources, no network operations, nor any code that manipulates data in a potentially malicious manner. No embedded or hidden malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious code logic, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
