  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the IMDbPY project.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file from the current directory to get the long description.",
  "targets": "No direct data sink, but the setup process installs dependencies and package info; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md file into long_description; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup procedures to package a Python project. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is a common practice. No untrusted input handling or network activity is present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior detected. The dependencies and URLs point to official or well-known repositories. Overall, it appears to be a benign setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution without any suspicious activity.",
