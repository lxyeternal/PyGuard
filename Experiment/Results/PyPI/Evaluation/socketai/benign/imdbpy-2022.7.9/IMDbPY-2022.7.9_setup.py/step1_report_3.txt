{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing the IMDbPY project, specifying dependencies, description, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file from the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing, network communication, or sensitive data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content from disk into 'long_description' variable used in package metadata; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected. The code appears to be standard packaging script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'os' modules, defines a version, and a function to read the README.md file for a long description. It then calls 'setup' with package metadata, including dependencies and URLs. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or malicious constructs. The use of 'os.path' to locate and read a file is standard for setup scripts. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to configure package metadata for distribution.",
