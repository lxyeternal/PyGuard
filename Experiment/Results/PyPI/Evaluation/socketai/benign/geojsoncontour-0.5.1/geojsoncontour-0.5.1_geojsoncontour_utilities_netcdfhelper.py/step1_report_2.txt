  "purpose": "Helper module for transforming netCDF data files into GeoJSON format for visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename via sys.argv, reads netCDF file using xarray, accesses dataset variables and attributes, reads environment and file paths.",
  "sinks": "Uses plt.savefig implicitly through matplotlib, writes GeoJSON files via geojsoncontour, reads files from disk, potentially uses realpath, but does not write sensitive data to network.",
  "flows": "Input filename and variable name from command line -> load dataset -> process variables -> generate contour plots -> export GeoJSON files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed. Uses standard libraries appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily processes netCDF files to produce GeoJSON contours for visualization. It employs standard scientific libraries (xarray, numpy, matplotlib, geojsoncontour). The flow involves reading a filename and variable, processing dataset variables, plotting contours, and exporting GeoJSON. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or malicious data handling routines are present. The code does not include any obfuscated or malicious segments; it performs its intended data transformation securely. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual file handling were observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign data processing utility for geospatial visualization. It does not contain malware, malicious code, or security risks based on the provided implementation.",
