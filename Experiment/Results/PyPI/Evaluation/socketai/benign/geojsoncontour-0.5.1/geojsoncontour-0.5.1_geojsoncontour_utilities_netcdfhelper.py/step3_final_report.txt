  "purpose": "Transform netCDF datasets into GeoJSON format for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads netCDF files, extracts variables, and dataset attributes.",
  "sinks": "Writes GeoJSON files to disk with filenames based on dataset info.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> processes data -> generates contour plots -> exports GeoJSON files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads datasets using xarray, extracts latitude and longitude variables, sets up contour levels, and iterates over time steps to generate GeoJSON files from contour plots. It employs standard scientific libraries (numpy, matplotlib, geojsoncontour) without any network connections or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. File handling is straightforward, and no sensitive data is processed insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for converting netCDF data into GeoJSON for visualization. It shows no malicious intent or security risks. The code is clear, with no suspicious activity or obfuscation, and the minimal security risk score of 0.1 accurately reflects its benign nature.",
