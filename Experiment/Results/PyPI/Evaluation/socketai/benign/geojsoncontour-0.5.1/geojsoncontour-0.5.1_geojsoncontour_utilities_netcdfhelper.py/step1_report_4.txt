  "purpose": "Helper module to convert netCDF data to GeoJSON format for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input file path from command line arguments, opens netCDF datasets, accesses dataset variables and attributes, reads variable data, and constructs file paths for output GeoJSON files.",
  "sinks": "Writes GeoJSON files to disk with filenames based on input filename and time index; no other external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input filename from sys.argv -> os.path.realpath -> xr.open_dataset -> dataset variables and attributes -> numpy operations and plotting -> geojsoncontour to generate GeoJSON files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or unnecessary dynamic execution. The code performs data processing and file output without evident malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads netCDF data, processes variables and dimensions, generates contour plots, and saves GeoJSON files based on dataset variables. Usage of external libraries such as xarray, matplotlib, and geojsoncontour appears appropriate and intended. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The filename handling is straightforward, and no user input is directly executed as code. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or sensitive information. It strictly handles data visualization and file output. Overall, the code appears benign and focused on data transformation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard data processing script for converting netCDF data to GeoJSON files. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It functions solely to generate visual data outputs from provided input files. The overall security risk is minimal.",
