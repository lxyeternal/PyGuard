  "purpose": "Transform netCDF data into GeoJSON format for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename from command line argument, reads netCDF file, reads variables and attributes from netCDF dataset, reads data arrays (lat, lon, var), generates plots and GeoJSON files.",
  "sinks": "Creates GeoJSON files using geojsoncontour, writes output files to disk with filenames based on input filename and parameters.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> load dataset -> extract variables -> generate contours -> convert contours to GeoJSON -> write files to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious URL connections, no unusual code behavior, no obfuscated code. Uses standard libraries for data processing and plotting.",
  "analysis": "The script processes netCDF files to generate GeoJSON contour plots. It reads data from files specified via command-line arguments, manipulates datasets using xarray, and outputs GeoJSON files. All data handling appears to be for visualization; no network connections, system commands, or sensitive data processing are present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code segments are detected. The use of plotting libraries and file I/O is consistent with data conversion tasks, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data processing and visualization tasks without any indication of malicious intent or malicious code behavior. It is a utility script for transforming datasets and does not contain malware or security risks.",
