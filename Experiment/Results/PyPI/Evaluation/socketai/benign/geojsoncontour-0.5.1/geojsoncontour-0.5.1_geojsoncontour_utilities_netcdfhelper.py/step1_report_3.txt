{
  "purpose": "Convert netCDF data to GeoJSON format for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename from command line, reads netCDF files using xarray, accesses dataset variables, reads attribute 'units', reads data arrays 'lat' and 'lon'.",
  "sinks": "Generates GeoJSON files with names based on input filename, variable, and time index; writes output GeoJSON files to disk.",
  "flows": "Reads filename and variable from command line -> loads netCDF dataset -> processes spatial and temporal data -> generates contour plots -> converts contours to GeoJSON -> writes GeoJSON files to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no obfuscated code. Use of plotting libraries and file operations are standard. No suspicious network activity or code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The script processes netCDF data, extracts spatial and temporal variables, and generates GeoJSON files. It uses standard libraries (xarray, numpy, matplotlib, geojsoncontour, os, sys). No user inputs other than filename and variable, with safe file handling. The output is written to disk; no network communication or suspicious code. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to geospatial data processing. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden payloads are evident. The code structure and libraries used are standard and do not indicate obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing script for converting netCDF files to GeoJSON format. It performs no suspicious or malicious actions. It appears safe with no security risks identified.",
