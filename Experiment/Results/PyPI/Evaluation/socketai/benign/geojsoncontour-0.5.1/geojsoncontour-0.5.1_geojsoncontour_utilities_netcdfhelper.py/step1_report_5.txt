  "purpose": "Transform netCDF data files into GeoJSON format for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename from command-line arguments, reads netCDF data via xarray, reads environment variables via os, and accesses dataset variables and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Uses plt.contourf for visualization; writes GeoJSON files to disk via geojsoncontour.contourf_to_geojson with filenames derived from input path; no network or sensitive data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> load netCDF -> process variables -> generate plots -> export GeoJSON files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries for data processing and visualization. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed. The only file output is GeoJSON files with predictable filenames.",
  "analysis": "The script loads netCDF data using xarray, extracts variables, and generates contour plots. It then converts these plots into GeoJSON files using geojsoncontour. The process involves reading data, creating plots, and exporting files without any suspicious network activity or code that could be malicious. The use of os.path.realpath is standard; no signs of path traversal or code injection. The overall flow is straightforward and intended for data visualization. No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing and visualization script for netCDF to GeoJSON conversion. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility for geospatial data transformation.",
