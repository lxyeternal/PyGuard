{
  "purpose": "Extracts and yields vertices from a matplotlib Path object, splitting into continuous line segments based on path codes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from path.vertices and path.codes attributes of the Path object.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; primarily processes data within the function.",
  "flows": "Path data (vertices and codes) flows through the function, resulting in generator outputs of vertex arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed. No external system interactions or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The function correctly processes the Path object by iterating over its vertices and codes, generating arrays of vertices for continuous segments. It handles various path commands (MOVETO, LINETO, CLOSEPOLY, STOP) appropriately. No indications of malicious behavior such as network calls, data leaks, or code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for extracting vertices from a Path object, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on provided Path data without external system interaction.",
