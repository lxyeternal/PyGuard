  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for extracting path segments with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The exception handling is a safety feature, not a security risk. All reports' scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The minor elevation to 0.1 in one report is unjustified and should be corrected to 0."
