  "purpose": "A test suite for converting matplotlib contour plots into GeoJSON format, validating output files against benchmarks.",
  "sources": "Grid data creation, contour plotting functions, file operations for reading/writing GeoJSON files.",
  "sinks": "File creation, comparison, and deletion; no untrusted data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Grid data -> contour plotting -> conversion functions -> file output and comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured test suite utilizing standard libraries for plotting and file operations. It performs no malicious activities, external network communication, or obfuscation. File operations are typical for testing purposes, and no security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in one report is justified by file handling but does not indicate actual vulnerability.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
