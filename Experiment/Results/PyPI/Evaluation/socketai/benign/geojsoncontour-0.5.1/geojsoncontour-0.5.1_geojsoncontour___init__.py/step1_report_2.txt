  "purpose": "Importing specific functions from a local module named 'contour'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module '.contour'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as there are only imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports three functions from a local module. There are no data inputs, no execution logic, and no handling of external or untrusted data. This pattern is typical for modular code organization and does not indicate any malicious activity. The imports are standard and do not include dynamic execution or obfuscation. No suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import of functions from a local module, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
