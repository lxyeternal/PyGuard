{
  "purpose": "The code imports three functions related to converting contour data to GeoJSON format, likely for geospatial data processing or visualization.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sink points or potential data leaks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable, as the code only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns present. The code consists solely of import statements from a local module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions from a relative module, indicating it is part of a larger package related to geospatial contour processing. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious elements. No input handling or external data access is evident here. The code appears to be standard for a Python package module importing necessary functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, involving only standard import statements for functions likely used elsewhere in the package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident.",
