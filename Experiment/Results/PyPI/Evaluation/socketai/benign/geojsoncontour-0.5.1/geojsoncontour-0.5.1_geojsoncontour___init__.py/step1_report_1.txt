{
  "purpose": "Importing functions related to converting contour data to GeoJSON format, likely for geospatial data processing.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only imports from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data being output or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only function imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and consists solely of import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports three functions from a local module named 'contour'. There are no indications of data handling, user input, or output. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors detected. The import statements are standard Python syntax for modular code organization.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as part of a larger geospatial processing module. There is no malicious intent or security concern based solely on these import statements.",
