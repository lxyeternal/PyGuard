  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, and security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, data fetching, user input, environment variables, network calls, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writing, environment variable access, eval()/exec() execution, data transmission.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or network data flow into sinks like eval(), network sockets, or file writes, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URLs or credentials, use of eval()/exec(), obfuscation, suspicious network activity, unvalidated data flows.",
  "analysis": "The reports indicate that Report 1 suspects malicious patterns such as eval(), hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation, with scores of 0.6 (obfuscated), 0.4 (malware), and 0.6 (risk). However, without concrete code evidence, these are speculative. Reports 2-5 show no suspicious activity, with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and low risk scores (~0.2). Given the lack of actual code snippets, suspicion in Report 1 should be moderated; the scores should reflect potential but unconfirmed patterns. The other reports are consistent with benign assessments. Therefore, the final adjusted scores are: malware ~0.2, obfuscated ~0.3, risk ~0.4, aligning with the cautious suspicion in Report 1 but acknowledging the absence of concrete evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low to moderate suspicion primarily centered on Report 1, which suggests potential obfuscation and malicious patterns but lacks definitive proof. The other reports are consistent with benign code. Scores should be adjusted downward from initial suspicion unless further code evidence confirms malicious behavior.",
