  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'geojsoncontour' Python library, specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no execution of external commands or handling of untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Reading long description from file, then passing static metadata and dependencies to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup routine using setuptools. It reads a README file for long description, then calls setup() with static strings and lists for package info, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
