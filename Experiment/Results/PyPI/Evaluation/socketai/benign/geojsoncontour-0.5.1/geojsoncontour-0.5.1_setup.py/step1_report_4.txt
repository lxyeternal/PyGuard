{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'geojsoncontour' Python package, used to package and distribute the project, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, static package metadata, and dependencies specified in the install_requires list.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks present; the code primarily defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md → provides package metadata and dependencies to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks using setuptools, reading a markdown file for description, and specifying package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input handling or external data fetching occurs during execution. All operations are static and conventional for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py for a Python package with no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no signs of malware. It solely manages package configuration. Confidence is high in this assessment.",
