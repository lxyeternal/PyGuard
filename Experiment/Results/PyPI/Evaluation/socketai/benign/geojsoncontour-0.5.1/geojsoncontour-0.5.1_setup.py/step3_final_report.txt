  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads 'README.md' for long description and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static data passed to setuptools.setup() without dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README file and calls setup() with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The dependencies are standard packages. All reports concur that there are no malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or security issues. The code structure and content are consistent with benign package configuration scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
