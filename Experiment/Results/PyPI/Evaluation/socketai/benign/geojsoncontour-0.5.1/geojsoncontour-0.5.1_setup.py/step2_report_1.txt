  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Correctly describes the setup script's role.\n- Sources: Reads 'README.md' for long_description.\n- Flows & Anomalies: No suspicious behavior, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with identical reasoning.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: standard setup, no malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, standard setup script with no suspicious elements.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others, straightforward setup script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None detected; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores assigned:** All are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Malware score justification:** Since there's no malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation, malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; all code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Zero is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- The provided assessments are accurate.\n- No adjustments needed to scores.\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's straightforward nature.",
