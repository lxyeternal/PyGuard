  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'geojsoncontour' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; hardcoded package info and dependencies within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' file flows into 'long_description'; package setup info flows into packaging process. No external data flows to untrusted destinations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup using setuptools, reads a markdown file for description, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No code injection, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic found. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
