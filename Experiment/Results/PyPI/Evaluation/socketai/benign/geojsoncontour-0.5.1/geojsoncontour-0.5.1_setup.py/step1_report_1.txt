  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'geojsoncontour', including package metadata, dependencies, and distribution details.",
  "sources": "File input: 'README.md' for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'README.md' file into the 'long_description' variable, used in the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code uses standard setup procedures with no hidden or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a README file for description content and uses setuptools to configure package details. There are no dynamic code executions, no network calls, no data leaks, and no suspicious logic. All dependencies and metadata are standard for Python packaging. The structure and content align with typical setup scripts, indicating no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package setup tasks without any suspicious code or actions.",
