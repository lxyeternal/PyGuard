  "purpose": "Convert matplotlib contour and contourf objects into GeoJSON features (LineStrings, Polygons, MultiPolygons) for spatial data representation.",
  "sources": "Matplotlib contour objects (get_paths, get_edgecolors, levels), external utility functions (multi_polygon, keep_high_angle, set_contourf_properties, get_contourf_levels), numpy arrays for coordinates.",
  "sinks": "Optional file output (geojson_filepath), returning serialized GeoJSON strings or FeatureCollection objects.",
  "flows": "Contour object data (paths, colors, levels) → Utility functions for geometry processing → Creation of geojson Features → Collection of features → Serialization or file writing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external network calls. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward transformation of matplotlib contour data into GeoJSON features, utilizing standard libraries and external utilities presumed safe. It processes geometries, assigns properties, and serializes data, with optional file output. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The external utility functions are assumed benign based on their naming and context. File operations are controlled via parameters, and no external network activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for converting matplotlib contours into GeoJSON format. It exhibits no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects standard file operations without external threats.",
