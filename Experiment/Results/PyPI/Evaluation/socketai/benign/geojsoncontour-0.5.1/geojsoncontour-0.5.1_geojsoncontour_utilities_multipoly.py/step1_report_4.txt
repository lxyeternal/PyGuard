  "purpose": "Helper module for transforming matplotlib contour data into GeoJSON MultiPolygon format, including polygon orientation correction and property setting for visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from geojson, numpy, and local vertices module; data read from path.to_polygons() and numpy arrays; input parameters for functions such as path, min_angle_deg, ndigits, levels, extend.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or system command executions observed. No sensitive data handling or secrets present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from path.to_polygons() through orientation and filtering functions, into multi_polygon output; vertices are processed via numpy for geometric operations, then converted into GeoJSON structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code appears focused on geometric processing with no obfuscated constructs. No unusual code constructs or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs geometric operations such as orientation detection, angle filtering, and polygon construction, all based on numpy arrays and standard geometric formulas. It includes functions to adjust polygon winding order, filter vertices by angle, and prepare visualization properties. The logic is consistent with standard computational geometry and GeoJSON formatting practices. No network calls, external data access, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code seems intended solely for visualization and transformation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for converting matplotlib polygons to GeoJSON with orientation corrections and property settings. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no indications of malware, data leaks, or malicious activity. Overall security risk is very low.",
