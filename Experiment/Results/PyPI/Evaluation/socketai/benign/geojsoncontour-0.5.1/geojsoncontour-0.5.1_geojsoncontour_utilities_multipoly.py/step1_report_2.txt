{
  "purpose": "Helper module for transforming matplotlib contour data into GeoJSON MultiPolygon objects.",
  "sources": "Reads path.to_polygons() output; inputs from parameters such as min_angle_deg, ndigits, levels.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from path.to_polygons() into processing functions; no external untrusted data flows to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of enum, numpy, geojson appears standard. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution, or system manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily processes polygon data, determining orientation, filtering vertices based on angles, and converting polygons to GeoJSON format. It uses standard libraries and straightforward geometric computations. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious inputs are present. The functions focus solely on geometric transformations and formatting for visualization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard helper module for polygon processing with no apparent malicious intent. It performs geometric calculations and data formatting without engaging in any suspicious activities or system manipulations. The code is safe for use in secure environments.",
