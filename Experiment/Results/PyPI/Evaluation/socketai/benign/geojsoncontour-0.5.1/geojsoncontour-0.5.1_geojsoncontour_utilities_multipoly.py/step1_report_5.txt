  "purpose": "Helper module for transforming matplotlib.contour plots into GeoJSON MultiPolygon objects, including utilities for polygon orientation, filtering vertices, and generating level labels.",
  "sources": "Imports (geojson, numpy, get_vertices_from_path), functions accepting external inputs (path, min_angle_deg, ndigits, levels, extend), and data passed into functions (e.g., path.to_polygons(), vertices).",
  "sinks": "None identified. No output or external data transmission present; no untrusted data sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input from path.to_polygons() flows into polygon processing functions, with optional filtering and reordering. Processed polygon data is converted into a GeoJSON MultiPolygon object. No data is transmitted externally or executed as code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and performs geometric calculations and data formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utilities for polygon orientation detection, vertex filtering based on angles, and GeoJSON conversion. It does not perform any network communication, execute external commands, or handle sensitive data. The functions rely on external inputs like paths and numerical parameters, but these are standard for geometric processing. No suspicious code flows, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a benign helper module focused on geographic data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign helper module for processing polygons and converting them to GeoJSON format. It contains no signs of malicious intent, no external data leaks, and no suspicious code behavior. Overall security risk is negligible.",
