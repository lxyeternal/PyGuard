  "purpose": "Transform matplotlib contour data into GeoJSON MultiPolygon objects, handling polygon orientation, filtering vertices by angle, and setting visualization properties.",
  "sources": "path.to_polygons() method providing polygon data; numpy arrays for geometric calculations; internal functions for vertex extraction.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; data remains within the processing pipeline, primarily generating GeoJSON objects.",
  "flows": "Input from path.to_polygons() -> orientation detection and vertex filtering -> GeoJSON MultiPolygon creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Uses standard libraries and straightforward geometric processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs geometric operations such as orientation detection, vertex filtering based on angles, and GeoJSON formatting. It relies on numpy for calculations and geojson for output. No external system interactions, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The functions are well-structured, with clear purpose and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for processing polygon data, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores across the reports are consistent and justified, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
