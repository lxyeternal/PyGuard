  "purpose": "Helper module for transforming matplotlib contour data into GeoJSON MultiPolygon format, including polygon orientation handling and level categorization.",
  "sources": "Reads path.to_polygons() output, numpy array operations, and parameters such as min_angle_deg, ndigits, level levels.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted external input directly; no network, file, or environment variable interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Path data flows into multi_polygon() -> orientation() and keep_high_angle() for processing -> final data assembled into GeoJSON MultiPolygon.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. Functions perform geometric calculations without external system interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs geometric computations: determining polygon orientation, filtering vertices by angle, rounding coordinates, and assembling GeoJSON structures. It uses numpy for array operations and geojson for output. No external input handling or network interactions present. No obfuscated code structures or dynamic code execution identified. The logic appears straightforward and intended for data transformation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a geometric data transformation utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.",
