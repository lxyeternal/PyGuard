  "purpose": "Helper module for transforming matplotlib contour data into GeoJSON MultiPolygon objects, including geometric processing and property setting functions.",
  "sources": "Reads path.to_polygons() output; np operations on vertices; function parameters for levels, fill properties, min_angle_deg.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; uses standard libraries and functions without writing or network transmission.",
  "flows": "Path data flows from path.to_polygons() through geometric processing functions, with no external untrusted data involved or output to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code performs standard geometric operations. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or malicious behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles geometric processing of polygon vertices, including orientation detection, angle filtering, and formatting for GeoJSON. It utilizes standard libraries (numpy, geojson) and internal functions for geometric calculations. There are no apparent inputs from untrusted sources that could lead to injection or data leaks. No network activity, file access, or external data manipulation is present. The functions operate on provided data structures, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility module for geometric data transformation with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geometric utility for converting matplotlib polygons to GeoJSON, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not include any suspicious operations or security vulnerabilities.",
