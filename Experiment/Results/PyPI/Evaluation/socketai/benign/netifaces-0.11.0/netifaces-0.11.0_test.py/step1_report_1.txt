  "purpose": "To list network interfaces, their addresses, netmasks, broadcast addresses, and gateways on the local machine.",
  "sources": "Reading network interface details, addresses, netmasks, broadcast addresses, and gateway information via the netifaces library.",
  "sinks": "Printing data to standard output; no untrusted data handling or external communication is involved.",
  "flows": "Data retrieved from system network configurations flows directly to print statements, with no external data flows or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the netifaces library to query and display network interface information, including addresses and gateways. It does not perform any data modification, external network communication, or execute untrusted data. The logic is straightforward, and no obfuscation or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign network information utility that enumerates network interfaces and gateways. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are detected.",
