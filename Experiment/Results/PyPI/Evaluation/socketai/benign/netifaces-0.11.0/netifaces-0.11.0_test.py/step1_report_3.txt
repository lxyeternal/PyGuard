  "purpose": "The code enumerates network interfaces, their addresses, and gateways on the system.",
  "sources": "netifaces.interfaces(), netifaces.ifaddresses(), netifaces.gateways()",
  "sinks": "Printing addresses and gateways, which are data outputs, but no untrusted data is used as input or affects system state beyond display",
  "flows": "Data from netifaces functions flows to print statements, displaying network configuration info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply gathers and displays network info without any suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The script imports the netifaces library and lists all network interfaces, addresses, and gateways, printing detailed information for each. It retrieves interface addresses, address families, and default gateways, formatting and displaying the data. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads. Usage is straightforward and consistent with system network information gathering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard network information retrieval script using netifaces, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration; it merely outputs system network configuration details.",
