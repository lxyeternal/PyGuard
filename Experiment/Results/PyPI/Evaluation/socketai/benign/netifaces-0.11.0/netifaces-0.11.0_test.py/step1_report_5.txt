{
  "purpose": "The code enumerates network interfaces, their associated addresses, and gateways on the system using the netifaces library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from system network interfaces, their addresses, and gateway configurations via the netifaces library functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs network interface and gateway information to standard output; no data is sent over networks or stored externally.",
  "flows": "System data (network interfaces and gateways) is read and directly printed; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. Usage of netifaces is standard for network info retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The script utilizes the netifaces library to gather and display network interface details, including addresses, netmasks, broadcast addresses, and gateways. It performs straightforward data retrieval and printing operations without any modification, external communication, or suspicious behavior. No source-to-sink malicious data flows are identified. The code’s purpose appears solely informational and aligns with typical network diagnostic scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard network information script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely reads and displays system network configuration details without external communication or sensitive data handling.",
