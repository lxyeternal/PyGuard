{
  "purpose": "To enumerate network interfaces, their addresses, and gateways on the host system.",
  "sources": "Reading network interface names, addresses, address families, and gateway information using the netifaces library functions.",
  "sinks": "Printing data to the console; no data sinks involved that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the netifaces library functions (sources) and directly printed to stdout (sink) without further processing or external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data handling or communication observed. The code straightforwardly retrieves and displays network configuration details.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the netifaces library to list network interfaces, their associated addresses, address families, and gateways. It processes and outputs this data directly to the console. No user input is taken, no data is sent over the network, and no secrets or sensitive data are stored or transmitted. The usage is standard and aligns with typical network diagnostic scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign network information enumeration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reports network configuration details to the console without performing any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
