{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and displays network interface details, addresses, broadcast addresses, and gateway information.",
  "sources": "Reads network interface names, address information, and gateway data via the netifaces library.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console; no untrusted data handling or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from netifaces methods (interfaces, ifaddresses, gateways) to print statements for display.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. Uses standard library functions for network info.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically gathers network interface details, including addresses, netmasks, broadcast addresses, and gateway info, then prints this info. It does not process or transmit untrusted data beyond console output. No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no code injection, and no external network communication apart from reading local system info.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely informational, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to display network configuration data without modifying system state or transmitting data externally.",
