  "conclusion": "The code reviews indicate no confirmed malicious activity across all reports. Obfuscation in Report 1 warrants cautious scoring but does not confirm malware. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified. Minor adjustment to Report 1's malware score to 0.3 could improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable. No significant changes are necessary."
