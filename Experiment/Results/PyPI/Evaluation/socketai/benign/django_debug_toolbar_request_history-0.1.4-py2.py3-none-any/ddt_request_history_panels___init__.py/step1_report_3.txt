  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or computation tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, environment variables, or external files/readers (though not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or subprocess executions if present; these are not explicitly identified in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or variables to sinks like output files or network transmissions, if present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are apparent. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code does not include any clear malicious patterns. It appears to perform legitimate data processing tasks without suspicious or malicious code pathways. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized network communication. The absence of obfuscation and lack of suspicious function calls support this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard data processing script. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
