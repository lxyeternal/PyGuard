  "conclusion": "The analyzed reports mostly indicate benign code with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The primary concern is the use of eval/exec functions, which can be exploited maliciously but currently show no evidence of malicious activity. The overall security posture is low risk, with scores appropriately reflecting the limited evidence. No significant modifications are necessary; continued vigilance is advised when eval/exec are present."
