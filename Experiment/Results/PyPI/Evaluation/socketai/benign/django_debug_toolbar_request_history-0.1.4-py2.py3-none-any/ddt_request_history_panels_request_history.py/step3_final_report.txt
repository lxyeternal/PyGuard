  "purpose": "Implements a Django debugging toolbar with request history, middleware patching, and response injection.",
  "sources": "Request data, filesystem (template), environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Modifies response content via regex, sets cookies, updates headers.",
  "flows": "Request data → generate_stats → process_request → response modification.",
  "anomalies": "Uses threading.Timer for delayed middleware patching; loads templates from disk; patches middleware dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a debugging tool for Django, involving runtime patching, request tracking, and response content injection. No malicious external calls, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. Use of threading.Timer and filesystem access are typical in debugging environments but could be considered slightly unconventional. Overall, the code exhibits standard debugging practices without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django debugging toolbar extension with request history and middleware patching. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
