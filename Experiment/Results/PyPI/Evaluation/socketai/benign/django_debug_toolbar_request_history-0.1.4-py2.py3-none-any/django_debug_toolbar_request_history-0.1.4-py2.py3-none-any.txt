      "confidence": 0.6,
      "conclusion": "The analyzed reports mostly indicate benign code with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The primary concern is the use of eval/exec functions, which can be exploited maliciously but currently show no evidence of malicious activity. The overall security posture is low risk, with scores appropriately reflecting the limited evidence. No significant modifications are necessary; continued vigilance is advised when eval/exec are present."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code reviews indicate no confirmed malicious activity across all reports. Obfuscation in Report 1 warrants cautious scoring but does not confirm malware. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified. Minor adjustment to Report 1's malware score to 0.3 could improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable. No significant changes are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django debugging toolbar extension with request history and middleware patching. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose."
