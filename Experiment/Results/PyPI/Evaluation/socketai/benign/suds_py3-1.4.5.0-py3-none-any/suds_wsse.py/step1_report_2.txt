  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for handling WS-Security tokens, including username tokens and timestamps, for web services security.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-provided username and password for the UsernameToken; system time for token creation; optional nonce text input.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the XML representation of security tokens, which could potentially be used in SOAP headers. No direct data leaks or external communications are evident.",
  "flows": "User inputs (username, password, optional nonce) are processed to generate security tokens, which are then converted into XML structures for WS-Security headers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hashlib for sha256, but with fallback to md5 (imported as sha256) on import error, which is insecure. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines security token classes with methods for generating nonces and timestamps. The nonce generation uses sha256 hashing, but in environments without hashlib, falls back to md5, which is insecure but not malicious. The code lacks external network activity, data leaks, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated or malicious behavior is apparent. The overall design is standard for WS-Security token handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of WS-Security tokens with a minor security concern regarding the fallback to md5 hashing. No malicious intent or behavior is detected. It is safe in context, with a low malware risk.",
