  "purpose": "The code provides WS-Security token handling, including UsernameToken and Timestamp classes, for generating XML security headers with nonces and timestamps.",
  "sources": "Username and password inputs, system time functions for timestamp and nonce generation.",
  "sinks": "XML elements representing security tokens; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (username, password, nonce, timestamp) are processed to generate XML elements; nonce is created via hashing username, password, and current time.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback md5 hashing when hashlib.sha256 is unavailable; weak cryptographic hash used as a compatibility fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of WS-Security tokens with methods for nonce and timestamp creation. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The fallback to md5 is insecure but appears solely for compatibility, not malicious intent. No network activity or data exfiltration is detected. The nonce generation method, while predictable if username and password are known, is a common pattern. The overall structure and logic are sound, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and the minor cryptographic weakness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of WS-Security tokens with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only concern is the fallback to md5 hashing, which is insecure but not malicious. The current low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate; the risk score could be marginally increased to 0.3 to reflect the cryptographic weakness, but overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
