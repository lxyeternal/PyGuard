  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of WS-Security tokens with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only concern is the fallback to md5 hashing, which is insecure but not malicious. The current low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate; the risk score could be marginally increased to 0.3 to reflect the cryptographic weakness, but overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
