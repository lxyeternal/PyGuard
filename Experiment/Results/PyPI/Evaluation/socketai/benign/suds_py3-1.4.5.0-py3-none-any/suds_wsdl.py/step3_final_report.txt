{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WSDL parser and object model, loading WSDL and schema definitions from URLs or XML, resolving references, and representing WSDL components as objects.",
  "sources": "URL loading in Import.load(), Definitions.__init__, and related methods; XML element and attribute access.",
  "sinks": "External URL fetches during import and load operations; reference resolution.",
  "flows": "URLs are resolved via urljoin, loaded into Definitions objects, and references are resolved through qualify() calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious code or backdoors. URL encoding of 'location' is benign but unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured WSDL parser. It loads external resources via URLs, which could be exploited if URLs are malicious, but the code itself contains no malicious logic. Exception handling and reference resolution are typical. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate WSDL processing library with no malicious intent or sabotage. The main risk stems from external URL loading, which is inherent to such tools but does not indicate malicious behavior. Proper validation of URLs before loading can mitigate potential risks.",
