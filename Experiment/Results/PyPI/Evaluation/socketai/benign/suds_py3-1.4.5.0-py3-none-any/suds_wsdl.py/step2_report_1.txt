  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the technical details, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a WSDL parser, loading WSDLs via URLs, resolving references, building objects. No malicious code or backdoors are detected. URL encoding of 'location' is not malicious. Exception handling is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs standard WSDL parsing with no signs of malicious activity. The low risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the potential for external URL loading, but that is inherent to WSDL tools.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard import and schema handling, with no suspicious code. External URL loading is typical but could be risky if URLs are malicious, but no malicious code is present.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. No malicious behavior detected, just the inherent risk of loading external resources.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the potential risk of URL loading in 'load' and 'import' methods. Recognizes that malicious URLs could be exploited but the code itself does not contain malicious logic.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3.\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.3) due to external URL fetching, which could be exploited if URLs are malicious. Still, no malicious code present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing that the code is a standard WSDL parser with no suspicious code or backdoors. URL encoding is not malicious. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No malicious activity, just standard parsing.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a standard WSDL parser, with URL loading being typical but not malicious. No signs of malicious code or sabotage.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0, consistent with the code being straightforward and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.2 to 0.3). Given the code loads external URLs (WSDLs, schemas), the main concern is the potential for supply chain issues if URLs are malicious or compromised. However, the code itself does not perform malicious actions.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard risk associated with external resource loading in such parsers)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured WSDL parser.\n- No malicious payloads, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- The only inherent risk stems from external URL fetching, which is common in such tools.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified based on the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Risk           | 0.2             |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
