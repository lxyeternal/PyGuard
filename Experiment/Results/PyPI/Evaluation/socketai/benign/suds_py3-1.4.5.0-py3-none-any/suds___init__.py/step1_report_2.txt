{
  "purpose": "This code provides a lightweight SOAP client for Python, including exception handling, utility functions, and compatibility support.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or untrusted data sources directly. It primarily defines classes, functions, and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects. The code does not perform I/O operations with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious or vulnerable behavior. Utility functions convert objects to strings but do not handle untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The license and author info are standard. No obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes, utility functions for string conversions, and compatibility support for Python 2/3. It includes a safe string conversion method (smart_str) that handles exceptions and encoding. No external input handling or network operations are present. The code structure is standard and well-commented. No malicious patterns, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or command execution, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a SOAP client library with supporting utilities. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
