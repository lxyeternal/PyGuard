{
  "purpose": "This code provides a lightweight SOAP client library with exception handling, utility functions, and compatibility support for Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted input or data reading mechanisms; standard library and local module imports only.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or output operations that process untrusted data; exception messages are constructed from internal variables.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; exception messages use internal variables or parameters, no external input processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; standard license and exception handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions, utility functions (like smart_str and tostr), and basic class structures for SOAP client handling. It relies on local imports and standard exception handling. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The license and comments indicate open-source distribution, and no suspicious network or system interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a SOAP client library with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain suspicious code or behavior. The only notable aspect is that it imports local modules, but nothing indicates malicious activity.",
