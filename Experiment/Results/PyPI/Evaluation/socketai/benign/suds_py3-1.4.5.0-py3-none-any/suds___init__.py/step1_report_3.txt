{
  "purpose": "This code provides a lightweight SOAP client in Python, including exception handling, utility functions, and compatibility features.",
  "sources": "No input sources such as user input, environment variables, or network data are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations are identified.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily defines classes and utility functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard and straightforward; no suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No hardcoded credentials or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes, utility functions for string conversion, version info, and error handling for a SOAP client. It includes a compatibility layer for string types and standard exception messaging. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated logic, or insecure operations. It imports a Client class from a local module, which is not included, but no evidence suggests malicious intent in the provided code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation of a Python SOAP client support library with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily defines utility functions, exception classes, and version info. The code appears benign and safe for use.",
