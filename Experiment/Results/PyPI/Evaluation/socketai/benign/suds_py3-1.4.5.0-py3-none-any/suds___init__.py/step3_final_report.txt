{
  "purpose": "A lightweight SOAP client utility library providing exception classes, string handling functions, and version info for web service interactions.",
  "sources": "Internal data structures, exception messages, and utility functions; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or system modifications; data flows are internal and limited to exception handling and string conversions.",
  "flows": "Data flows within exception classes and utility functions, primarily converting data types and handling errors; no malicious or suspicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SOAP client utility module with exception classes, string conversion functions, and compatibility support. It does not perform network operations, system modifications, or handle untrusted data in a malicious manner. The only external import is '.client', which appears to be a local module. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minor security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports likely reflects cautious handling of error messages, but overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured open-source utility library for SOAP web service clients. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The low risk scores are justified and should be considered as minimal or negligible.",
