  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader that performs dynamic import based on an input parameter. It does not contain malware or obfuscation but poses a security risk if 'name' is not validated. The current scores are appropriate; a slight increase in the security risk score to around 0.5 would better reflect the potential risk. Implementing input validation or whitelisting is recommended to mitigate this vulnerability."
