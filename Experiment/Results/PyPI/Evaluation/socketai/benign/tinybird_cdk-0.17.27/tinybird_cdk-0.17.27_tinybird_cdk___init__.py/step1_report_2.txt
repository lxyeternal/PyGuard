  "purpose": "Dynamically loads a connector module based on the provided name and returns its Connector instance.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'name' used to construct module name; importlib.import_module used to load module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executing untrusted module if 'name' is maliciously crafted; raises exceptions for missing modules.",
  "flows": "The 'name' parameter influences importlib.import_module; if valid, calls the Connector() method of the imported module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import based on user input could lead to loading unintended modules if 'name' is manipulated; no validation of 'name'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module based on a string constructed from 'name', which could be exploited if 'name' is controlled by an attacker. Exception handling is limited to missing modules, raising a custom error. The function ultimately calls the Connector() method from the imported module. There are no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no network activity. The code relies on external modules and assumes they are safe. The main concern is the potential for arbitrary module import if 'name' is maliciously crafted, which could lead to executing malicious code if a malicious module exists or is introduced.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is straightforward but contains a potential security risk due to dynamic module import based on user input. If 'name' is controlled by an attacker and the environment allows malicious modules to be present, it could lead to execution of malicious code. Overall, the code appears legitimate but relies on safe input and environment hygiene to prevent exploitation.",
