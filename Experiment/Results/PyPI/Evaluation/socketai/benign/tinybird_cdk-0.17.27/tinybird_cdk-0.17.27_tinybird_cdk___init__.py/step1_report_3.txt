{
  "purpose": "Dynamically loads and returns a connector object based on the provided connector name.",
  "sources": "The function 'connector_for' reads the input parameter 'name' to determine which module to import.",
  "sinks": "The 'importlib.import_module' function dynamically imports a module based on the constructed module name; the returned 'Connector' object may be used downstream.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' is used to construct module name -> importlib.import_module loads module -> 'mod.Connector()' instantiates and returns connector object.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic import based on user input without validation, which could be risky if 'name' is maliciously crafted. However, this pattern is common in plugin architectures; no other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that imports modules dynamically using a string constructed from user-provided input. It handles missing modules by raising a custom error. The code appears straightforward and typical for plugin-based systems, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the dynamic import, which could be exploited if 'name' is untrusted, but without further context, this is a standard pattern for extensibility. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard plugin loader pattern with no evident malicious intent. Its security risk is minimal but depends on how the 'name' parameter is validated elsewhere. No malware or obfuscated code detected.",
