{
  "purpose": "Dynamically imports and returns a specific connector class based on the provided name.",
  "sources": "The function uses the 'name' parameter to construct a module name string and imports the module via importlib.import_module.",
  "sinks": "The dynamic import operation could potentially import malicious or unintended modules if 'name' is not properly validated.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' -> constructs module name -> importlib.import_module -> access 'Connector' attribute -> return Connector instance",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors observed. The code relies on dynamic import but does not validate 'name' beyond module existence.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that dynamically imports a module based on the 'name' parameter, which could be exploited if 'name' is controlled maliciously. The exception handling re-raises specific errors, ensuring that only known connectors are used. The code itself does not contain malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration, but the dynamic import mechanism could be exploited if inputs are not sanitized. There are no obfuscation signs or hidden code; the structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is intended to facilitate dynamic connector loading and does not appear malicious by itself. However, the use of dynamic import based on unvalidated input could pose security risks if the input is not controlled or validated properly. Overall, the code does not contain malware or malicious behavior, but caution should be exercised regarding input validation.",
