{
  "purpose": "Dynamically loads and returns a specific SQLConnector module based on the provided name.",
  "sources": "The 'name' parameter passed to connector_for function; importlib.import_module dynamically imports a module based on 'name'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential indirect risk if 'name' is maliciously crafted to import unintended modules.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' -> constructs module name string -> importlib.import_module -> accesses mod.Connector() -> returns connector instance.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with unvalidated input 'name' could lead to unintended module loading. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to import a module dynamically using 'importlib.import_module' based on the 'name' argument. It handles ModuleNotFoundError to raise a custom error if the module isn't found. The function then returns an instance of 'Connector' from the imported module. There are no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior observed. However, the use of dynamic import based on user input poses a potential security concern if 'name' is not validated, as it could allow importing unintended modules, but this is a standard pattern for plugin-like systems. There is no indication of malicious intent or malware in this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical plugin loader that relies on dynamic import. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. The main security consideration is to ensure that the 'name' parameter is validated to prevent loading unintended or malicious modules. Overall, the code appears safe but should be used within a controlled environment.",
