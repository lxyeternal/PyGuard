  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code dynamically imports modules based on a 'name' parameter, constructs a module name string, and retrieves a 'Connector' class from that module, returning an instance. It handles ModuleNotFoundError to raise a custom error if the module isn't found.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues in the code?**  \n  The code matches the description in all reports. No additional issues are present beyond the potential security concern with dynamic import.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Input validation:**  \n  None of the reports mention validation of 'name'. The code relies solely on the existence of the module. This could lead to security risks if 'name' is maliciously crafted, but the code itself is straightforward and not malicious.\n\n- **Error handling:**  \n  Properly raises a custom error if the module isn't found, which is good.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the fact that the code itself does not contain malicious logic.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, citing the main concern of unvalidated 'name' input leading to potential loading of unintended modules.  \n  Given the code's pattern, this is a valid concern but not an immediate vulnerability.  \n  **I agree with these scores.**\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No report assigns a risk score above 0.4, which seems appropriate.  \n- The potential for exploitation exists if 'name' is controlled maliciously, but without further context or validation, the risk remains moderate.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in assessing that the code is not malicious but could pose security risks if inputs are not sanitized.\n\n### Additional observations:\n- The code pattern is common in plugin architectures, where dynamic import is used intentionally.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The main concern is input validation, which is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2 to 0.4** (moderate, based on input validation concern)\n\n**In my opinion,** the overall risk is low if the environment controls the 'name' parameter, but the potential for security issues exists if 'name' is untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward and not malicious.\n- The main vulnerability is the dynamic import based on unvalidated input, which could be exploited in certain environments.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to 0.3), reflecting moderate concern over input validation.\n\n**Note:** To improve security, validate 'name' against a whitelist of allowed connector names before importing.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No evidence of malware or obfuscation; the security concern is about input validation, which is a common pattern but should be handled carefully.",
