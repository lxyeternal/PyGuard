  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings, scores, and conclusions.\n\n**Summary of findings across reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as dynamically importing modules based on a 'name' parameter.\n- The main concern is that unvalidated 'name' input could lead to importing malicious or unintended modules.\n- None of the reports identify actual malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware within the code.\n- The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk scores are moderate (around 0.3 to 0.4), reflecting the potential danger of dynamic import without validation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly describe the code snippet provided.\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All assign 0, which is consistent.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation (0.2 to 0.4). The higher scores reflect the risk of dynamic import based on untrusted input.\n\n---\n\n### Logical errors or flaws:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the main risk stems from lack of validation of 'name' before import.\n- No report claims the code is malicious or contains malware; all are cautious but not alarmist.\n- The exception handling is appropriate, raising a custom error if the module isn't found.\n- The analysis correctly notes that this pattern is common in plugin architectures but emphasizes the importance of input validation.\n\n### Scores justification:\n\n- Since **no actual malicious activity or malware is present**, the malware scores of 0 are justified.\n- The **security risk scores** could be slightly higher if the environment is untrusted, but given the code alone, moderate risk is appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores are reasonable** based on the code and analysis.\n- The reports could slightly increase the security risk score to 0.5 if considering worst-case scenarios, but 0.4 remains acceptable.\n- The malware score should stay at 0, as no malware is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** ~0.4 (due to dynamic import without validation, which is a known security concern but not inherently malicious)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard plugin loader that relies on dynamic import. It does not contain malware or obfuscation but poses a security risk if 'name' is not validated. Proper input validation should be enforced to mitigate this risk.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that 'name' is validated against a whitelist of allowed modules in production environments to prevent potential exploitation.",
