  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure the scores and conclusions are justified and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is primarily a set of abstract classes and utility functions for data connectors (SQL, cloud, streaming).\n- It manages data flow via querying, exporting, appending, replacing, and cleanup routines.\n- It relies on external modules (`errors`, `logger`, `tinybird`) and standard libraries.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- The code appears to be a typical, well-structured data connector framework.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines abstract classes/utilities for data pipelines.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, standard code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Framework for SQL, cloud, streaming connectors.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Abstract classes for connectors, data export/import.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Framework for database/cloud connectors, data flow.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Data connectors for ingestion, export, management.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard data connector framework with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The risk scores are low (0.2), which aligns with the absence of suspicious patterns.\n- Malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, as expected.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- It performs legitimate data management functions with proper resource handling.\n- External dependencies are standard, and no secrets or network anomalies are present.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to the potential misuse of data sinks, but overall very safe)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable. No modifications are necessary.",
