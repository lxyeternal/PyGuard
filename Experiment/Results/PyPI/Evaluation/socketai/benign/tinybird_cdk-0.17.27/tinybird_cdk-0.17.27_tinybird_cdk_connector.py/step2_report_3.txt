  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a framework for data connectors, handling data flow from sources (queries, files, URLs) to sinks (Tinybird, cloud storage).  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard patterns, external modules, and proper resource management.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion states a low security risk, with high confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior is evident.  \n- The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the absence of suspicious activity.  \n- The malware score (0) aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a data connector framework, with no unusual data flows.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or behavior is found. The code is standard, with proper resource handling.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), low risk (0.2), malware (0).  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is consistent; no issues detected.  \n- The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Again, a standard data connector framework, with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Same as above, low risk, high confidence, malware zero.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is sound, and the scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar pattern, with no suspicious data flows.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Same reasoning, scores aligned.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No issues here; the reasoning is solid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same general description.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detected.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence, low risk, malware score zero.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard, well-structured data connector framework with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behaviors.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which seems justified.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, due to standard data handling and external dependencies, but no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable. The code appears to be a legitimate data connector framework with no supply chain security issues or malicious intent.",
