{
  "purpose": "The code defines abstract classes and utility methods for various database and cloud storage connectors, including data export, import, and management functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through methods like _export() which process SQL queries and file streams. No external untrusted input sources such as user input or network data are directly read in this code segment.",
  "sinks": "Data is exported or appended via tinybird.Client methods, which interact with external storage or databases. No direct data leakage or malicious system actions are evident within the code itself.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves preparing data or queries, then passing them to tinybird.Client for storage or processing. There are no direct source-to-sink paths involving untrusted input; data flows from internal methods to external clients.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hard-coded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code contains standard patterns for resource management, logging, and data handling. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of abstract classes defining API interfaces for database and cloud storage connectors, along with helper methods for temporary file handling and data serialization. There is no indication of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors. Usage of external clients and data handling appears standard and benign. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic is present. The code relies on external dependencies for actual data operations, with no embedded malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be standard, well-structured application logic for data connectors without malicious behavior. It provides abstraction for data export/import with no suspicious or harmful code elements.",
