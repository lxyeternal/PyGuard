  "purpose": "Framework for data connectors handling data flow between sources (queries, files, URLs) and sinks (cloud, Tinybird).",
  "sources": "External modules (errors, logger, tinybird), data inputs via query strings, files, URLs, and client interactions.",
  "sinks": "External systems via Tinybird API, cloud storage URLs, local files, and data objects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source functions (query, file, URL) through export and append/replace methods to external sinks, with cleanup routines ensuring resource management.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of abstract classes and utility functions for data connection management, with proper exception handling, resource cleanup, and external API usage. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. External dependencies are standard, and data handling appears secure and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured data connector framework with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and security risk (0.2) scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
