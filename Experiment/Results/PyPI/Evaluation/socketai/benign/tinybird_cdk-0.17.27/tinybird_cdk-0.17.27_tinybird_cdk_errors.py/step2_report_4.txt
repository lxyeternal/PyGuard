  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, with no dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated constructs.\n- All reports correctly identify that these classes are straightforward error containers.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are evident.\n- Exception messages are standard and serve error reporting purposes only.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code does not contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious constructs.\n- No external data, secrets, or network calls are involved.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- No logical flaws are present in the reasoning.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are also low or zero, aligning with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- No issues warrant a risk score higher than 0.5. The code is purely for structured error handling, with no malicious activity.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- Since the code is just exception class definitions, malware score should remain 0.\n- No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concern. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the existing assessments. The code is safe, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.",
