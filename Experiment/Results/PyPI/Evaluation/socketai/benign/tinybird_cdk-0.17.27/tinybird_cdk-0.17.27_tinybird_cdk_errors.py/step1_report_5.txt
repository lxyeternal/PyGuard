{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors in the CDK and Tinybird client context.",
  "sources": "None (exceptions are user-defined and do not read external input).",
  "sinks": "None (exceptions are raised locally; no external data output or network activity observed).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exception data is used internally).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no external data inputs, network calls, or cryptic code structures. All exception classes are straightforward, inherit from standard Exception classes, and only format error messages. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It serves as part of a larger codebase to manage errors cleanly.",
