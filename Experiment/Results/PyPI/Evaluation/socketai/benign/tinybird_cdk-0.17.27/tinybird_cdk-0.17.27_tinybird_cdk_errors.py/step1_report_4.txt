  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the CDK and Tinybird client ecosystem.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and constructor methods (__init__) that initialize exception objects with error messages and details.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__() calls which pass error messages to base Exception class; potential data leakage if exception messages include sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input data (error messages, URLs, names) flows into exception constructors, then into base Exception, which may be displayed or logged.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data. Exception messages include variable data like 'name', 'error_message', 'job_id', 'response', 'scheme', which are typical for error reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes inheriting from base Error classes, with constructors mainly formatting and passing messages to the superclass. No user input or untrusted data is directly fetched or processed here. The messages include dynamic content but are related to error conditions, not malicious code execution. There are no code injection, backdoors, network operations, or data leaks embedded in these class definitions. The purpose is standard error handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward exception class definitions for error handling purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The messages are typical for error reporting. No security risks are detected.",
