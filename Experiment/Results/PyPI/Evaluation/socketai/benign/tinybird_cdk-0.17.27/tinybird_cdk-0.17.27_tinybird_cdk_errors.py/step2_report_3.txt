  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from base classes (`Error`, `TinybirdClientError`, etc.).\n   - The constructors primarily format messages and pass them to the superclass.\n   - There are no functions executing external commands, network calls, or data processing.\n   - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Logical and Structural Analysis**:\n   - The exception classes are standard, well-structured, and serve typical error handling purposes.\n   - Exception messages include variable data such as `name`, `error_message`, `job_id`, etc., which are expected in error reporting.\n   - No signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, backdoors, or data leaks.\n\n3. **Scores Review and Justification**:\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0 across reports, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which aligns with the fact that these are exception definitions with no external interactions.\n   - The `risk` scores are mostly 0 or very close to it, which is justified because the code only defines error classes.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - Exception messages include dynamic data; however, this is standard practice and does not indicate malicious behavior.\n   - The only point to consider is whether exception messages could leak sensitive information if they include secrets or sensitive data. But in this code, messages contain only identifiers and error descriptions, which are typical and not inherently risky.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion**:\n   - The code is a collection of standard exception class definitions.\n   - No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n6. **My Personal Assessment**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 (correct)\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0 (correct)\n   - **Risk score**: 0.1 to 0.2 (since no external data or secrets are involved, and it's purely error handling, I would keep it at 0.1 or 0)\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is safe, with no supply chain security issues detected.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
