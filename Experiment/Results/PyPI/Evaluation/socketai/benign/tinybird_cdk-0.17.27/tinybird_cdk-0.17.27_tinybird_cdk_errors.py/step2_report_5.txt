  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:  \n   The code defines multiple custom exception classes for error handling within a Python application, specifically related to CDK and Tinybird client contexts. All classes inherit from a base `Error` class or other exception classes, and their constructors mainly format and pass error messages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or external data handling is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - Exception messages are straightforward, with no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n   - The classes serve purely for structured error reporting.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes**:  \n   - The exception classes are standard and well-structured.\n   - There are no evident logical errors or security flaws.\n   - The use of `super().__init__()` with formatted messages is appropriate.\n   - The `message` attribute in some classes (e.g., `ExternalDatasourceError`, `SnowflakeConnectionError`) is set but not used elsewhere; this is acceptable but could be redundant if not used later.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which is justified—no malicious code is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All are 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign a risk score of 0 or 0.1. Given the code's nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate; a score of 0.1 for report 4 is marginally acceptable but still very low, as there's no evidence of security risk.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - The only minor point is that exception messages include variable data, which could leak sensitive info if not carefully managed elsewhere. However, this is standard practice and not inherently malicious or risky in the context of exception classes.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is a clean, standard implementation of custom exceptions.\n   - No malicious activity, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- No changes needed in scores.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malware.\n- The exception classes are appropriate for structured error handling.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely for error handling and contains no malicious or risky elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable. No further action is necessary.",
