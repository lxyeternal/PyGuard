  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a CDK and Tinybird client context.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and inheritance; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__() calls which propagate exceptions; no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and propagation through class hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes with descriptive messages and inheritance. No data input, external communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. Exception messages are static or based on function parameters but do not contain any hidden or malicious code. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are found. The structure is typical for error handling in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions intended for error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
