  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions.\n- No external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- Exception messages are straightforward, with no embedded secrets or suspicious content.\n- No obfuscation, malicious logic, or backdoors are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of error classes for error management within a Python application.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for defining exceptions; no issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes?**  \n  No logical errors or flaws are noted. The exception classes are correctly implemented, with appropriate inheritance and message formatting.\n\n- **Scores for Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0 or very close to 0\n\n  These are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a high risk score. The code is standard exception handling, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score Reflection?**  \n  The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's content.\n\n- **Claims Based on Assumptions?**  \n  All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n- **Score Consistency?**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate. They recognize that the code is purely for error handling and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The security risk is negligible; the code does not pose any threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes intended for structured error handling within a Python project. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; no further action needed.",
