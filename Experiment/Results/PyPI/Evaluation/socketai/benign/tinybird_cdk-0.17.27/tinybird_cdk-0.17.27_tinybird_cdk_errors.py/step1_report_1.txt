  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the CDK and Tinybird client context.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or external data sources).",
  "sinks": "None (no output or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "None (no data or control flow involving external or untrusted sources).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; all classes are standard exception definitions with no dynamic code execution or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a series of custom exception class definitions, mostly inheriting from base Error classes, with constructors that format error messages. No user input, network calls, or data handling logic is present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs are identified. The code appears purely for structured error reporting within a Python application, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward collection of custom exception classes used for structured error handling. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks. All classes are standard and serve the purpose of exception management, with no external or untrusted data processing.",
