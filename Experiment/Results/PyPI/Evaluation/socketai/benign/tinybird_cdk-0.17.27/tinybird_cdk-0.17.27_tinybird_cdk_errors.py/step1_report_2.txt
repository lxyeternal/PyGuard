  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a CDK and Tinybird client context.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, __init__ methods, and string formatting for exception messages.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising points (super().__init__ calls) which could output messages or cause error handling flows.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with message parameters -> call to super().__init__ with formatted message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code consists solely of exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from base Error or other exceptions, mainly providing structured error messages. The __init__ methods format messages with provided parameters, but there is no dynamic code execution, network access, or data leakage. Exception messages are straightforward, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. The classes serve purely as error containers with no malicious intent or suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes intended for structured error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is safe and appears to be a legitimate part of a larger application for error management.",
