{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for structured error handling within the application, covering various error scenarios related to connectors, cloud services, external data sources, and job errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data; it only defines classes and constructors.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output; exception messages are formatted but do not lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not execute data flows or logic beyond class initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with constructors that format messages and inherit from base error classes. There are no dynamic executions, external data handling, network calls, or obfuscated constructs. Exception messages include variable data such as URLs, IDs, or error descriptions, which are standard in error reporting. The implementation is clean, correct, and serves as a structured error management system. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes used for error handling, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues. The assigned scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
