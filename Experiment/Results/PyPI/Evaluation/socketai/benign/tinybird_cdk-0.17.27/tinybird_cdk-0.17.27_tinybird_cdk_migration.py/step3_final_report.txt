{
  "purpose": "The code performs schema parsing, comparison, and migration SQL generation for database schemas, ensuring schema consistency and supporting schema evolution.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns for type detection, schema data structures, and input SQL queries.",
  "sinks": "SQL string outputs for schema alteration, exception raising for unsupported migrations.",
  "flows": "Input SQL query -> parse_path extracts schema identifiers -> get_migration compares schemas -> _build_alter_schema generates SQL statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; regex for date types straightforward; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on schema validation and migration logic, with standard regex use, schema comparison, and exception handling. No network, file, or external system interactions are present. The functions are logically consistent, with proper handling of schema differences and unsupported operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The regex patterns are simple and used solely for type identification. Exception handling is appropriate for unsupported schema changes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk near zero) are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured schema management utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate. The overall security risk is negligible, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a very low risk score around 0.1.",
