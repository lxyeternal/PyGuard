{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle schema parsing and migration for database tables, particularly for comparing and updating schemas based on provided input.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters such as sql_query, tb_schema, and bq_schema; uses regex patterns for matching types.",
  "sinks": "Does not appear to have any sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; primarily processes data internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through parsing and comparison functions, leading to potential schema alterations, but no external actions like network calls or file modifications are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. The code's functionality is consistent with schema handling. No obfuscated code detected. The use of regex is straightforward. No suspicious dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs schema parsing, comparison, and migration logic without involving any network, file system modification, or sensitive data handling. It uses regex matching for type identification and string manipulation for schema updates. The functions are well-structured, with error handling for unsupported migrations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware indicators. All operations are limited to internal data processing related to schema management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a schema management utility focused on safe schema comparison and migration logic. It does not contain malicious code, malware, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a benign, purpose-driven implementation with no security risks or malicious intent.",
