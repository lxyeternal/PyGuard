{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle schema parsing and comparison between Tinybird and BigQuery schemas, including schema migration logic.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'sql_query' string in parse_path; schema data in 'tb_schema' and 'bq_schema' objects, including columns and sql_schema properties.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data. Schema manipulation and string formatting are used internally without direct untrusted data execution.",
  "flows": "Input 'sql_query' flows through regex parsing to extract schema info; schema data flows into comparison functions which generate schema alteration SQL fragments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of regex for parsing is straightforward and not suspicious. No obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs schema parsing and comparison functions, utilizing regex matching for date types and constructing SQL statements based on schema differences. No unsafe code injection or data leakage vectors are evident. It primarily operates on structured schema data and performs validation and string concatenation. There are no network operations, file I/O, or use of untrusted input beyond the initial 'sql_query' string. The code enforces schema consistency and supports limited schema migration features, explicitly rejecting unsupported operations like column removal. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a schema handling utility with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe schema validation and transformation without exposing sensitive data or performing unsafe operations.",
