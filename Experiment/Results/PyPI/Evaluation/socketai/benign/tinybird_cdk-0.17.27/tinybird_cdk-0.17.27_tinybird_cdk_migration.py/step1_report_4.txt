{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to parse and compare database schemas, generate SQL alter statements, and handle schema migrations in a structured manner.",
  "sources": "User-provided SQL queries (in parse_path), schema dictionaries (tb_schema, bq_schema), and function inputs for schemas and types.",
  "sinks": "SQL schema strings, potential database schema modification commands, and exception handling pathways.",
  "flows": "Input SQL query -> parse_path extracts table info -> get_migration compares schemas -> _build_alter_schema constructs SQL statements; schema data flows from sources to sinks through functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. Usage of regex for type patterns is benign. The code is structured for schema handling; no obfuscated patterns or misleading variables are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on schema comparison and migration logic, utilizing regex matching for date/time types and comparing column schemas. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are present. Exception handling for unsupported migrations is in place. The overall logic is consistent with schema management, and no malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate schema parsing and migration utility without malicious intent. It safely compares schemas, constructs SQL statements, and handles schema changes within expected parameters. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
