{
  "purpose": "This code appears to facilitate schema parsing and migration between databases, specifically handling schema comparison, parsing SQL queries, and generating ALTER schema statements for migrations.",
  "sources": "The code reads SQL queries (parse_path), schema definitions (tb_schema, bq_schema), and schema components such as column types and names.",
  "sinks": "The code generates new schema SQL statements and raises exceptions on unsupported schema changes; no data leaks or external effects are directly present.",
  "flows": "Input SQL queries and schema data flow into parsing and comparison functions, which then produce schema modification strings or raise exceptions based on schema compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code relies on regex matching and straightforward schema comparison. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network calls are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs schema parsing, comparison, and migration logic. It uses regex to identify data types and compare schema fields, raising exceptions for unsupported operations like column removal. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The logic is standard for schema management tasks, with proper exception handling for unsupported migrations. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are identified. The code does not handle or process untrusted data sources directly, nor does it invoke external commands or network calls.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward schema management utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs schema parsing and comparison tasks without involving any network operations, data exfiltration, or hidden functionalities. The code appears secure and free from supply chain maliciousness.",
