{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle schema parsing, comparison, and migration logic between schemas, mainly for database tables.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from parameters such as 'sql_query', 'tb_schema', and 'bq_schema', which are data structures and strings provided by the user or calling functions.",
  "sinks": "The code processes schema data and generates SQL schema statements, but does not directly execute or send data over the network. It also uses regular expressions to parse input strings.",
  "flows": "Input data (schemas and SQL queries) are parsed and compared; schema differences lead to generated SQL statements or exceptions. No untrusted data is fed into system commands or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or system modification commands are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs schema comparison and migration logic, utilizing regex parsing and data validation. It does not include network operations, file access, or external command execution. The functions check for schema differences, handle exceptions for unsupported migrations, and build SQL statements accordingly. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The code appears to be well-structured and focused solely on schema validation and transformation, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a schema management utility that validates and constructs schema migration statements without any indication of malicious intent. It does not perform any network operations, data leakage, or malicious activities. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
