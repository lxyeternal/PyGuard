{
  "purpose": "Defines constants for data formats and a function to return MIME types based on format strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'fmt' of the function 'mime_type_for'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing MIME types based on 'fmt'; exception raising if input is invalid.",
  "flows": "Input 'fmt' flows into conditional checks, leading to return statements or exception.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded string comparisons; no input validation or sanitization; no external data or secrets involved.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for data formats and a function that maps a format string to its MIME type. It includes conditional checks for 'csv', 'ndjson', and 'parquet'. If an unrecognized string is passed, an exception is raised with a descriptive message. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or suspicious behaviors are present. The exception is intended as a safeguard against incorrect usage, not malicious activity. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple constant checks and exception handling for unknown formats. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
