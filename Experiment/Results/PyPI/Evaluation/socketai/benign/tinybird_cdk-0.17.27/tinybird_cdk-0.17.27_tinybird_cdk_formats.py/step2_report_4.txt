  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code simply maps known format strings to MIME types and raises an exception for unknown formats. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or data leaks.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard. They note the exception handling as a safeguard, which is appropriate. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n   The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is simple, with no external dependencies, no data leaks, and no malicious logic.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis, which is correct.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a benign utility for mapping data formats to MIME types. The reports are thorough and accurate. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks is present.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just for completeness, but effectively zero)\n\nThe minimal risk is due to the exception handling, which is a standard validation practice, not a security concern.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and does not pose any security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
