{
  "purpose": "Define MIME types for different data formats and provide a function to retrieve MIME type based on format string.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'fmt' in mime_type_for function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs MIME types; exception raised on unknown format.",
  "flows": "Input 'fmt' flows into conditional checks, leading to return statements or exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The exception for unknown format is standard for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for data formats and a function to return their MIME types. The function checks the input string against known formats and returns corresponding MIME types. If an unknown format is passed, it raises an exception with an error message, which is a reasonable validation approach. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The use of explicit string comparisons and exception handling appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and designed to map format strings to MIME types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as expected for a format-to-MIME type mapping utility.",
