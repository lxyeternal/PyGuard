{
  "purpose": "Define MIME types for different data formats and provide a function to retrieve the MIME type based on the format string.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'fmt' in mime_type_for(fmt). No external data sources or user inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing MIME type strings based on input. No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'fmt' is compared against known strings, leading to returning specific MIME types. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses straightforward string comparisons and a well-defined exception for invalid inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines format constants and a function that returns MIME types for each format. It includes a safeguard that raises an exception if an unknown format is provided, which is a good practice. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated behavior. The code is simple, clear, and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly maps format strings to MIME types and handles invalid inputs with an exception.",
