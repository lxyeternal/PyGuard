  "purpose": "Define constants for data formats and provide a function to get MIME types based on format string input.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'fmt' of the function 'mime_type_for'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs MIME type strings based on 'fmt'.",
  "flows": "Input 'fmt' -> conditional checks -> corresponding MIME type return or exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. The exception for unknown formats is a safeguard, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines string constants for data formats and a function that returns MIME types based on a string input. The function checks for specific string values ('csv', 'ndjson', 'parquet') and returns appropriate MIME types. If an unknown format string is provided, it raises an exception with a descriptive message. No external data sources, network operations, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and intended for data handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a utility for MIME type mapping with proper handling of unexpected inputs. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
