  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency, correctness, and to identify any potential issues.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines constants for data formats and a function `mime_type_for(fmt)` that returns MIME types based on string comparisons.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, benign, and free of malicious behavior.\n- The exception for unknown formats is a defensive measure, not an indication of malicious intent.\n- No external data sources, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The function correctly maps `'csv'`, `'ndjson'`, and `'parquet'` to their MIME types.\n- **Error handling:** The exception for unknown formats is appropriate and not suspicious.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk:** All reports agree these are zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correct, the code is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correct, straightforward utility.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correct, the comment about the unreachable error condition indicates defensive programming.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correct, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code is as described; no issues or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Any anomalies or assumptions?**  \n  No. The comments about the unreachable exception are standard defensive programming, not suspicious.\n\n- **Potential improvements?**  \n  The code could be made more robust by normalizing input (e.g., case-insensitive comparison), but that is outside the scope of current security analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n**Based on all reports and analysis, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a simple utility mapping format strings to MIME types, with proper error handling. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present, and the security risk is negligible. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final malware, obfuscated, and risk scores: 0, 0, 0.**",
