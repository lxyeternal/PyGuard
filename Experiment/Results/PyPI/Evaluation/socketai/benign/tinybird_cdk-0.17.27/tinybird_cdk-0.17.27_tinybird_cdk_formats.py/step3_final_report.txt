{
  "purpose": "Map data format strings ('csv', 'ndjson', 'parquet') to their respective MIME types with error handling for unknown formats.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'fmt' provided to the function 'mime_type_for'.",
  "sinks": "The return value of the function; no data sinks or external data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Input 'fmt' is compared against known strings; upon match, MIME type is returned; otherwise, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "The comment about an 'unreachable' error condition suggests defensive programming but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, straightforward utility mapping format strings to MIME types. It performs explicit string comparisons, raises an exception for unknown formats, and contains no external data dependencies, network calls, or obfuscated/malicious code. The exception handling is a standard validation measure. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The code's transparency and simplicity indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function with no malicious or security-compromising elements. It correctly maps known formats to MIME types and handles unknown formats safely. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the code's harmless nature.",
