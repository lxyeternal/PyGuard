  "purpose": "Define constants for data formats and provide a function to determine MIME types based on format strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'fmt' to the function 'mime_type_for'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing MIME type strings based on input; no external sinks or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'fmt' -> Conditional checks -> Return corresponding MIME type string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code includes a comment about an unreachable error condition which indicates some defensive programming but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for data formats and a function to return MIME types based on a string input. The function uses simple conditional logic to map strings to MIME types. The exception raised for unknown formats is a safeguard against invalid inputs, with a comment explaining that it should not normally be triggered. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard utility code for MIME type handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign utility for mapping format strings to MIME types. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The comment about an unreachable error condition suggests awareness of potential misuse but does not indicate malicious activity.",
