  "purpose": "Generate random UUID-based filenames, directory names, and partition lists into chunks.",
  "sources": "UUID generation via uuid.uuid4() for filenames and directory names.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not process untrusted input or write data to external systems.",
  "flows": "UUIDs generated are used directly as filenames or directory names without external input; no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: one creates a filename with a UUID and an extension, another creates a directory name as a UUID, and the last yields chunks of a list. All functions rely solely on uuid.uuid4() for generating identifiers, which is a standard, secure method for creating random UUIDs. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs, and no network activity. The code appears to serve legitimate purposes related to temporary file/directory name generation and list processing. No signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, well-structured, and uses standard libraries without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks and appears to be intended for safe utility purposes.",
