  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Functions are straightforward and common.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple utility functions. 'random_filename' and 'random_dirname' generate UUID-based names, which are typically used for temporary or unique identifiers. The 'chunks' function splits a list into smaller parts. All functions rely on standard library 'uuid' and basic list operations, with no data input or output that could be exploited maliciously. There are no suspicious behaviors, no external data transmissions, and no code obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
