  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating UUID-based filenames, directory names, and splitting lists into chunks.",
  "sources": "Uses uuid.uuid4() for generating UUIDs; no external inputs or data flows.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; functions do not process untrusted data or output sensitive information.",
  "flows": "UUID generation functions produce identifiers; chunk function yields list segments; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard library, and lacks obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code relies solely on Python's standard library uuid.uuid4(), which is cryptographically strong for generating random UUIDs. Functions serve common utility purposes without external input, network activity, or data leaks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The functions are simple, well-structured, and do not perform any unsafe operations. The absence of obfuscation, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors indicates benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for UUID-based filename and directory name generation and list chunking. It uses secure, standard library functions, with no signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or supply chain threats. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
