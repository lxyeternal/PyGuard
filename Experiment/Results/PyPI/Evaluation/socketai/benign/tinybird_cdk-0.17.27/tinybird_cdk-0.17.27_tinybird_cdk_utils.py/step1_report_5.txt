  "purpose": "Generate random filenames and directory names using UUIDs, and create chunks of a list.",
  "sources": "UUID generation via uuid.uuid4()",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or external data outputs present",
  "flows": "UUIDs generated are used directly in return statements; no external or untrusted data flows involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; functions are straightforward and use standard library features",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: one generates a random filename with a specified extension using UUID4; another generates a random directory name with UUID4; the third creates chunks of a list. All functions utilize Python's standard uuid library, which produces cryptographically strong UUIDs. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The code appears benign and designed for typical utility purposes without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple utility functions for generating random filenames, directory names, and list chunks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware.",
