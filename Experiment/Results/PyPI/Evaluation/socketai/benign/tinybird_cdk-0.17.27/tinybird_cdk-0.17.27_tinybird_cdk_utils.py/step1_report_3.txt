  "purpose": "Generate random UUID-based filenames and directory names, and split lists into chunks.",
  "sources": "UUID generation functions (uuid.uuid4()) used in filename and directory name functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data is not used; UUIDs are generated internally and returned directly, with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. Use of uuid.uuid4() is standard for generating UUIDs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for generating UUID-based filenames, directory names, and splitting lists into chunks. uuid.uuid4() is a standard, cryptographically strong UUID generator. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks handling sensitive data, and no data flow from external inputs. The functions are simple and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security issues. It serves as a utility module for UUID generation and list chunking, with no evidence of supply chain threats or malicious code.",
