  "purpose": "Defines classes for exporting data and cleaning up resources, including local files and cloud storage objects.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as file paths, URLs, client objects, bucket names, and directories.",
  "sinks": "Resource deletion functions: os.remove for local files, client.rm and client.rmtree for cloud resources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored in object attributes; cleanup methods invoke deletion functions on these attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward resource cleanup framework with classes for local and cloud data. It performs expected deletion operations with proper exception logging. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. External client methods could pose risks if malicious, but within this code, they are used normally. The overall structure and behavior are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cleanup utility with no malicious intent or supply chain threats. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1–0.2—are appropriate and justified given the functionality and context.",
