  "purpose": "Define classes for exporting and cleaning up various data sources, including local files and cloud storage.",
  "sources": "Data input is provided through constructor parameters: 'data', 'url', 'path', 'client', 'bucket', 'key', 'directory'.",
  "sinks": "The 'LocalFile.cleanup()' method deletes files using os.remove. Cloud-related cleanup methods invoke 'client.rm' and 'client.rmtree', which could delete cloud storage objects.",
  "flows": "Input data (file paths, URLs, cloud identifiers) flows into object constructors; cleanup methods may delete or remove files/directories based on the stored attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward and adheres to typical patterns for file and cloud resource cleanup. No unusual or suspicious code patterns are evident; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The 'client' parameter is generic, but no suspicious behavior is indicated.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of classes representing export objects, some with cleanup methods. LocalFile.cleanup() deletes a file specified by 'path'. CloudFile and CloudDir invoke 'client' methods to remove resources. No user input parsing, data leakage, or code injection points are present. No hidden or malicious behaviors are detected. The code performs expected cleanup operations on local and cloud storage resources, with exception handling that logs errors.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a standard resource cleanup framework for files and cloud storage. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and conventional.",
