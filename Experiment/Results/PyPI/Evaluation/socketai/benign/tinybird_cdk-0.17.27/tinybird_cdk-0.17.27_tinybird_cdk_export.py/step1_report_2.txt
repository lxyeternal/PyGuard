  "purpose": "Define classes for exporting various data types, including local and cloud files, with cleanup methods.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__) of classes, especially URL, LocalFile, CloudFile, and CloudDir.",
  "sinks": "os.remove in LocalFile.cleanup, client.rm and client.rmtree in CloudFile.cleanup and CloudDir.cleanup.",
  "flows": "Object initialization → cleanup methods → invocation of os.remove or client methods for file or directory removal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of cleanup functions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class hierarchy for exporting data, including local and cloud storage. The cleanup methods perform deletion of local files and cloud resources, which is a legitimate functionality. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The use of try-except blocks with logging for cleanup errors is standard practice. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of data export classes with cleanup routines. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. It performs file and cloud resource cleanup responsibly, with error logging. Overall, it is safe and benign.",
