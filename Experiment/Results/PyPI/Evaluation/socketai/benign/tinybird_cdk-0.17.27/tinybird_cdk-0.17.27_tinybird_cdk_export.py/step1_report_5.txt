  "purpose": "Defines classes for exporting and cleaning up different types of data or files, including local and cloud storage.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__) for LocalFile, CloudFile, CloudDir, and data assignment in Data class.",
  "sinks": "os.remove() for local files, client.rm() for cloud files, client.rmtree() for cloud directories.",
  "flows": "Input data or file paths to class constructors, then invoke cleanup methods which call respective remove functions on trusted clients or os.",
  "anomalies": "Use of generic exception catching without specific handling, but no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed. No indication of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstractions for managing exported data, including cleanup procedures for local and cloud files/directories. Cleanup functions invoke system calls or client methods to remove data. No untrusted input handling or malicious behavior evident. The code relies on external clients for cloud operations, which could be misused if client methods are malicious, but within this code, no malicious intent is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility classes for data export management with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The cleanup methods perform straightforward file removal actions, and no suspicious or backdoor code is present.",
