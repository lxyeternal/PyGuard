{
  "purpose": "Provides thread-safe, timestamped logging functions with configurable tags, outputting logs via print().",
  "sources": "Reads configuration value 'TB_CDK_TAG' via config.get() for log tagging.",
  "sinks": "Outputs log messages to standard output using print().",
  "flows": "Functions call log() which formats timestamp, retrieves tag, and prints message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, thread-safe logging utility that formats logs with timestamps and configurable tags. It uses standard modules and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reliance on external configuration for the tag is typical and not inherently risky. The use of print() is suitable for debugging but not production logging. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and secure. It functions as intended without malicious intent or security issues. The minimal risk associated with external configuration does not constitute a security concern.",
