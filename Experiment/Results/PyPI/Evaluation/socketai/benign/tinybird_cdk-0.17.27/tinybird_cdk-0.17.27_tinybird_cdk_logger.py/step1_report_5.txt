{
  "purpose": "This code provides logging functions for different log levels (debug, info, warning, error) and outputs timestamped log messages with a configurable tag.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data via config.get('TB_CDK_TAG') and uses system functions for datetime.",
  "sinks": "The log messages are printed to standard output, which could be intercepted or redirected, but no direct untrusted input is written or sent externally.",
  "flows": "The functions debug, info, warning, and error call log, which retrieves the current timestamp and a tag from configuration, then prints a formatted message with a lock for thread safety.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated or unusual code structures detected. Usage of threading.Lock for synchronization is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes thread-safe logging functions that incorporate dynamic timestamping and configurable tags. It reads a configuration value for tagging logs, which is common in logging setups. No untrusted data sources are directly involved, and no external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions serve purely for local log output with standard practices. The code appears straightforward and lacks signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging utility designed to print timestamped log messages with a configurable tag. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It functions as a standard logging helper without any malicious or suspicious features.",
