  "purpose": "Logging utility functions for debugging and informational messages, with thread safety and timestamping.",
  "sources": "Configuration retrieval via config.get('TB_CDK_TAG') and input messages passed to logging functions.",
  "sinks": "Console output through print(), which is generally safe but could potentially be intercepted or redirected in certain environments.",
  "flows": "Input messages pass through the logging functions to the log() function, which adds timestamp, tag, and level, then outputs via print().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity. The config.get call could be scrutinized, but it appears to fetch a tag value, not sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple logging functions that are thread-safe via a lock. It retrieves a tag from a configuration object and outputs logs with timestamps. There are no external data flows, no malicious code, and no suspicious behavior. The use of print() for output is standard for debugging purposes. No signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward logging utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with proper thread safety and timestamped logs. The only potential concern is reliance on external configuration for the tag, but this alone does not suggest malicious behavior.",
