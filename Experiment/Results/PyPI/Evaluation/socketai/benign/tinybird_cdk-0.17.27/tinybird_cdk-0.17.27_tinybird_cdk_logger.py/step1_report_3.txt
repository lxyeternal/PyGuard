  "purpose": "Logging utility functions for debug, info, warning, and error messages, with timestamp and tagging.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data via config.get('TB_CDK_TAG') for the log tag.",
  "sinks": "The logs are printed to standard output, which could be captured or monitored, but no data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Source: config.get() retrieves a tag; Flow: the tag is used in log output; sink: print to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The use of threading.Lock ensures thread safety but is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides logging functions that timestamp messages and include a configurable tag, ensuring thread-safe output. No external data is read aside from a configuration parameter, and no untrusted input flows into sensitive sinks. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The use of config.get() is standard, assuming proper configuration management. Overall, the code appears to be a typical logging utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions to output timestamped log messages with a configurable tag, maintaining thread safety. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
