{
  "purpose": "This code defines logging functions for different severity levels (debug, info, warning, error) that output timestamped messages with a configurable tag, likely used for debugging or operational logging.",
  "sources": "The code reads a configuration value 'TB_CDK_TAG' from the 'tinybird_cdk' package via config.get()",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs logs, which could potentially leak information if messages contain sensitive data; the 'config.get()' might also read from environment variables or configuration files",
  "flows": "The logging functions call log(), which retrieves a timestamp and configuration tag, then outputs a formatted message to standard output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The use of threading.Lock() for thread-safe logging is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports threading and datetime modules for thread-safe logging with timestamped messages. It imports a configuration module 'tinybird_cdk' to retrieve a tag used in logs. Four functions (debug, info, warning, error) serve as wrappers around the general log() function, which acquires a lock before printing to avoid log message interleaving in multithreaded contexts. The log() function formats the current UTC time, retrieves a configurable tag, and prints a structured log message. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code appears to be a standard logging utility with no evident security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a straightforward thread-safe logging mechanism with configurable tags. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided content.",
