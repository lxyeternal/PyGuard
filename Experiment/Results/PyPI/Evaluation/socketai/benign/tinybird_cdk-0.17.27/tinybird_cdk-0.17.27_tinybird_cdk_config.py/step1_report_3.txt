  "purpose": "Retrieve configuration values from environment variables with fallback options and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables via os.getenv(key).",
  "sinks": "Raises an exception if a required environment variable is missing; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable value is fetched; if missing, may raise an exception or return default/None based on arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. The error class usage is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses environment variables to retrieve configuration data, with options for defaults and optional retrieval. It raises a custom exception if a required variable is missing. There is no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious flows. The logic appears straightforward and intended for safe configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration retrieval function with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply reads environment variables and handles missing data appropriately.",
