  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward configuration retrieval function. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code simply reads environment variables, handles missing values with fallbacks, and raises a specific exception if needed.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions. They correctly note the absence of suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. They also correctly interpret the purpose and behavior of the code.  \n   **Conclusion**: No logical errors or flaws in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign `malware` scores of 0 and `securityRisk` scores of 0.1 or 0.0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code. The `obfuscated` scores are 0, aligning with the straightforward code.  \n   **Suggestion**: The scores seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.1, which is appropriate. The code is a typical configuration utility with minimal security implications.  \n   **Conclusion**: No justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious activity detected.  \n   **Conclusion**: Malware score is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only interpret the code's behavior.  \n   **Conclusion**: No unwarranted claims.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis; all indicate low risk and no malware.  \n   **Conclusion**: Scores align well with the findings.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (minimal security risk, typical for configuration code)\n\n### Overall:\n\nThe code is a standard, safe configuration utility. The reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. There are no signs of supply chain risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0.1\n\nThis code is safe, with negligible security concerns.",
