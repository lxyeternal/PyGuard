  "purpose": "Retrieve configuration values from environment variables with fallback options and error handling.",
  "sources": "os.getenv(key) reads environment variables; kwargs['default'] and kwargs.get('optional') provide fallback values.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data beyond environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Source: os.getenv(key); Sink: return value or raise error if None and no fallback.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward environment variable access with standard fallback logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility to fetch environment variables, providing fallback defaults or optional None, and raising a custom error if the variable is missing. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The logic is clear, and the exception handling is standard. The code aligns with typical configuration patterns and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration retrieval function with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to environment variable handling, but no actual malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.",
