  "purpose": "Retrieve configuration values from environment variables with fallback options and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables using os.getenv(key).",
  "sinks": "Returns configuration values or raises an error; no direct sinks for untrusted data leading to security impact.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables flows through to return statements; error raising if missing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads environment variables with proper fallback mechanisms. It raises a custom error if the variable is missing and no default or optional flag is provided. Usage of environment variables is standard practice and does not involve risky operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling were identified. The code appears to be a typical configuration retrieval function with appropriate error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration accessor that reads environment variables, with proper fallback and error handling. No malicious activity or security risks are present in this snippet.",
