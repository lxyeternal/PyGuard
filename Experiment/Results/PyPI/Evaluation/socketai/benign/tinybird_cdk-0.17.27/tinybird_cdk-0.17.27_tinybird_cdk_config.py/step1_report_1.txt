  "sinks": "Returning environment variable values; raising exceptions if missing.",
  "flows": "os.getenv(key) -> return value; fallback to defaults or raise exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code straightforwardly accesses environment variables and handles missing values according to typical patterns.",
  "analysis": "The function safely reads environment variables and provides fallback options, raising a specific exception if the key is missing and no fallback is provided. No suspicious or malicious code is present. The code does not perform any data leaks, network activity, or system modifications. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration retrieval function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely within expected parameters.",
