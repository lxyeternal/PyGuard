  "purpose": "Retrieve configuration values from environment variables with fallback options.",
  "sources": "os.getenv(key) to read environment variables, access to 'kwargs' for defaults and options.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code only reads environment variables and raises an error if not found.",
  "flows": "Input (environment variable key) -> os.getenv -> conditional fallback -> potential error raise.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward environment variable retrieval with fallback options. It raises a custom error if the variable is missing and no fallback or optional flag is set. No malicious code or suspicious data flow is detected. The structure is simple and typical for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard environment variable lookup with safe fallback mechanisms. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It appears to be a normal configuration utility.",
