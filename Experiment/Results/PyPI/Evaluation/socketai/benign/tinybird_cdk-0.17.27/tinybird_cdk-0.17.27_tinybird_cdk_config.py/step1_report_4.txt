  "purpose": "Retrieve configuration values from environment variables with fallback options.",
  "sources": "os.getenv(key) reads environment variables; errors.MissingConfiguration may raise exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Raise exception in errors.MissingConfiguration; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "os.getenv(key) → return value; or raise error if None and no default/optional.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; standard pattern for config retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches environment variables and provides fallback options (default or None). It raises a specific exception if the key is missing and no fallback is provided. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Usage of environment variables and exception handling is typical for configuration management. No evidence of malicious intent or data leakage mechanisms is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration getter function with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It safely handles missing configurations via controlled exceptions and fallbacks.",
