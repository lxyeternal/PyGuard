  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it retrieves environment variables with fallback options.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The reasoning is sound; no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0.1, reflecting minimal concern due to reliance on environment variables. This seems reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; the code matches the description.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.1, consistent with the previous report.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Consistent with the code.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious logic or anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk 0.1.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Matches the code description.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None observed.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk 0.1.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk 0.1.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code simply reads environment variables and raises a custom exception if missing. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data exfiltration observed.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly set to 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in all reports, which is reasonable given that environment variable access can be risky if misused, but in this context, it's standard practice. No actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.  \n- The code is a standard configuration retrieval pattern with no signs of supply chain risk or malicious behavior.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (as indicated, minimal risk in standard environment variable access)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, straightforward, and correctly scored. No malicious or obfuscated behavior detected, and the security risk is minimal.",
