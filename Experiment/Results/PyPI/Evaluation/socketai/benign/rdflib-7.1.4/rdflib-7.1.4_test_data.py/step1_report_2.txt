  "purpose": "Define constants, import modules, and load a cached RDF graph for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file (__file__) to determine the test directory; importing modules; accessing the path to the 'simple_triple.py' data file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data processing that could lead to vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Importing modules and defining constants do not involve data flow from untrusted sources. The only dynamic data access is reading the file path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The 'cached_graph' function's implementation is not shown, but its usage appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up constants and paths for RDF data testing, using standard libraries and third-party RDF library. No code execution, data input, or network activity occurs. The 'cached_graph' function could potentially load external data, but without its implementation, it is presumed to be safe. The code does not contain obfuscated parts, suspicious logic, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for RDF testing, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It only defines constants and loads a pre-cached graph in a controlled manner.",
