{
  "purpose": "This code sets up URI references, file paths, and loads a cached RDF graph for use in testing or data processing within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute for path construction, importing modules, defining URIRef constants, and loading a graph from a file path.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data outputs or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Path construction from __file__ to TEST_DATA_DIR, usage of cached_graph to load data from a file, no flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code primarily deals with path and URI definitions, and a function call to load a graph.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party modules, defines constants, constructs file paths dynamically using __file__, and loads data into a graph object via cached_graph. All operations are straightforward setup tasks with no apparent malicious intent. No user input, untrusted data, or external network interactions are involved. The use of URIs and file paths appears legitimate and intended for data handling or testing.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard setup and data loading for RDF graphs in a testing context, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign configuration script.",
