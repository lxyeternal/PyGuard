  "purpose": "Define RDF graph URIs and paths for testing, and cache a specific RDF graph for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "File path for test data (TEST_DATA_DIR), import statements, URI string definitions",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data processing or output occurring in this snippet",
  "flows": "Path resolution from file system, usage of imported functions (cached_graph), URI references creation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard use of Path and URIRef",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines constants, and loads a graph from a test data file via a caching function. The URIs are standard, and the Path usage is straightforward. No input/output operations, no network communication, and no code injection points are present. The use of cached_graph could involve additional processing, but based solely on this snippet, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for test data, defining URI constants and loading a cached RDF graph. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident from this snippet.",
