  "purpose": "Define RDF namespace URIs, import modules, and load a cached RDF graph for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute for directory paths, and importing modules. The only data input is the file path of the current script (__file__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "The code constructs file paths and URIs; no untrusted data flows into vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or hidden behaviors observed. The use of __file__ for directory setup is standard. The variable 'SIMPLE_TRIPLE_GRAPH' loads a graph from a file named 'simple_triple.py', which is an unusual extension for a data file; however, the code simply loads the graph without executing it. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up constants, imports modules, and loads a graph via a function 'cached_graph' from a local module. It constructs several URIRef objects. No data input is taken from untrusted sources; the only file path used is derived from __file__, which is a safe, static attribute. The 'cached_graph' function's implementation is not shown, but assuming it reads data from the specified file, it appears to be a safe operation. No suspicious patterns, such as code execution, dynamic code, or network operations, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup for RDF data testing. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are evident from the provided code. The code is straightforward and follows standard practices, with no indicators of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
