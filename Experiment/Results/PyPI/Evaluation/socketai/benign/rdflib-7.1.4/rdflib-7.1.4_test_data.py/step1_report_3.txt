  "purpose": "Define RDF URI references, directory paths, and load a cached RDF graph for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file path (__file__), reads data from a specific directory (TEST_DATA_DIR / 'variants' / 'simple_triple.py')",
  "sinks": "None identified; no output, network, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Uses __file__ to determine paths, loads a graph from a specified data file",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URIs and directory paths is standard; no suspicious code structures or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a utility for graph caching. It sets up directory paths and defines several URI references, including some with 'urn' and 'http' schemes. It loads a graph from a specific file within the data directory. No dynamic code execution, user input processing, or network operations are present. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration or test setup script for RDF data.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard setup tasks for RDF testing without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
