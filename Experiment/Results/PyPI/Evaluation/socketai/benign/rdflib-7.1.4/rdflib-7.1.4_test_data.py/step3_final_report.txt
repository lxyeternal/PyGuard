{
  "purpose": "Define RDF URIs, establish file paths, and load a cached RDF graph for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __file__ variable to determine directory paths; loads data from 'simple_triple.py' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Path construction from __file__ to data file; loading data via cached_graph from the specified file.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual filename extension '.py' for a data file; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for RDF testing, defining constants and loading data from a local file. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is evident. The use of a '.py' extension for data is unconventional but not malicious. All imported modules are standard, and the data loading appears controlled. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a setup for RDF data testing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence.",
