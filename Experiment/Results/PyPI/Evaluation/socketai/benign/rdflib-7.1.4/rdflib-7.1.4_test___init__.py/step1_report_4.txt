  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is used in a vulnerable manner",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, then defines a constant TEST_DIR that stores the absolute path of the directory where the script resides. This is standard practice for determining script location. No data from untrusted sources is processed, and no actions are taken that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, benign operation to determine its own directory path. No malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
