  "purpose": "Obtain the absolute path of the directory containing the current script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the special variable __file__ to determine the script's file path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) is used by os.path.dirname() to get the directory, then os.path.abspath() converts it to an absolute path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, then assigns TEST_DIR to the absolute path of the directory containing the script, using __file__. It performs a common pattern for script directory resolution without any untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code is benign, with no vulnerabilities or obfuscation, and the logic is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical pattern for obtaining the script's directory path, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. All signals indicate a benign, straightforward implementation.",
