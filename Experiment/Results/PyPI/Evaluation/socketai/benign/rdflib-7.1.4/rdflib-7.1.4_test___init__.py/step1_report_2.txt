{
  "purpose": "The code sets a variable 'TEST_DIR' to the absolute path of the directory where the script resides.",
  "sources": "The code reads the value of __file__ to determine the script's file location.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is sent or written.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) flows into os.path.abspath and os.path.dirname to determine the directory path.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, then calculates the absolute path of the current script's directory using __file__ and assigns it to TEST_DIR. There are no data leaks, injections, or malicious behaviors present. The code is typical for determining the script's directory path.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard operation of obtaining its own directory path without any malicious intent or security issues.",
