  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines TEST_DIR as the absolute path of the directory containing the current script (__file__). This is a common pattern for obtaining the script's directory. No input validation, user input, or network operations are involved. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior. It is a simple, standard operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical pattern for setting a directory path relative to the script's location. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
