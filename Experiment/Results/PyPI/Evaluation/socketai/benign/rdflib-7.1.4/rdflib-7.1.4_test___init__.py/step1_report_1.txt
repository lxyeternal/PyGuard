  "purpose": "Defines a variable TEST_DIR that stores the absolute path of the directory containing the current script.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath and os.path.dirname read the current file path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the current file path through os.path.dirname to os.path.abspath, resulting in the absolute directory path stored in TEST_DIR.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward path resolution without any unusual or malicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, then calculates the directory of the current script with os.path.dirname(__file__), converting it to an absolute path with os.path.abspath. It is a standard practice to determine the script's directory. No external input, data leakage, or suspicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to establish a directory path variable. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
