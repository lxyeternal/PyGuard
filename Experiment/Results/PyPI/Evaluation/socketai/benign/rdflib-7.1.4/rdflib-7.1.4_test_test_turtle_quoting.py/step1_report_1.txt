{
  "purpose": "The code provides testing utilities for verifying correctness of string unquoting/unescaping in RDF serialization formats such as Turtle, NTriples, NQuads, and related formats. It includes functions for generating test pairs, running correctness tests, and ensuring proper parsing of quoted strings.",
  "sources": "Input sources are primarily hardcoded test data, including test pairs, sample strings, and serialized RDF data fed into the Graph.parse() method.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into rdflib's parsing functions and regular expression searches for validation purposes. No untrusted external input or data is read at runtime; all data is predefined within tests.",
  "flows": "Test functions pass quoted strings into unquoting functions and then parse them into RDF graphs to validate correctness. Regex checks are performed on serialized output to confirm escaping. Data flows from test data through unquote functions into RDF parsers and validation routines.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code uses standard testing patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present. The functions manipulate internal module states in a controlled way, with no external side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly focuses on testing string unquoting/unescaping functionality and RDF parsing correctness. It modifies internal module states temporarily in a safe manner. All data is hardcoded or generated within the test scope, with no external data reads or network communications. The usage of rdflib for parsing and serialization is standard. The regex for pattern matching is straightforward. No signs of malicious payload, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code appears well-structured, aimed solely at validating string handling logic, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for verifying the correctness of string unquoting/unescaping and RDF serialization/deserialization. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no external or hidden data flows, and no evidence of sabotage or malware. The code is safe for use in a security context.",
