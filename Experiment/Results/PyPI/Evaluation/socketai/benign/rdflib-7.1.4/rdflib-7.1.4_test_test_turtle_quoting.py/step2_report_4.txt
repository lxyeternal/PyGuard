  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, data flows, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a test suite for string unquoting/unescaping in RDF formats, with no external data, network activity, or suspicious code.\n- **Findings:** All data is hardcoded; functions modify internal module state temporarily in a safe manner; no obfuscation or malware signs.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The code is benign, with a high confidence score. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on correctness testing with standard data flows.\n- **Findings:** No external data or network activity; code performs standard string and RDF parsing validation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Assessment:** The minor security risk score likely accounts for the temporary modification of `ntriples.validate`, which is safe within the test context.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior; the code is safe. The low security risk is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctness testing of unquoting and RDF parsing, with controlled test data.\n- **Findings:** No external or untrusted data; standard use of rdflib; temporary flag modifications are safe.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity; the code is a typical test suite.\n\n**Verdict:** Safe, well-structured, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar correctness tests with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No external data, network, or malicious code; temporary modification of internal flags is confined.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (minimal)\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard testing setup, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Safe, high confidence.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Testing RDF string literal handling, with no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, external dependencies, or obfuscation; standard testing pattern.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (very low)\n- **Assessment:** The code remains a benign test suite.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there's no malware present. The code strictly performs correctness testing, string handling, and RDF parsing, all using standard libraries and safe practices.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports, as there's no obfuscation or suspicious code constructs.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, consistent with the lack of external data, network activity, or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to internal flag modifications in test wrappers, which are safe)\n\nThis code is a straightforward, well-structured test suite for RDF string handling. No security concerns or malicious behavior are evident.",
