  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the purpose, data flow, anomalies, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs RDF round-trip tests, reading files, parsing, serializing, and re-parsing. No external commands or untrusted data flows into system commands. Literals are modified in the 'hext' format to handle datatype issues, which is a known workaround, not malicious.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected. The literal modification is a benign workaround, not malicious code injection.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear, with some commented-out code but no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Very low, mainly due to the workaround for specific format issues.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. The only concern is the literal datatype adjustment, which is a controlled workaround, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code reads files, parses, serializes, and re-parses, with no external network activity. The literals are adjusted for 'hext' format issues.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear code, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — Minimal, justified by the controlled test environment.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent. The literal handling is a known workaround, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard RDF round-trip test suite. No external system calls or untrusted data flows. The literal datatype adjustment is for format compatibility.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, standard code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — The low score is justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code tests RDF serialization, with data flow from files into graphs, serialization, and re-parsing. No external network or malicious behavior. Literal modifications are for testing purposes.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Slightly above zero due to potential issues with untrusted data, but controlled in tests.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, focusing on controlled file-based testing. No external network activity or malicious code. Literal modifications are for format compatibility.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — Justified as the code operates on local test data.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), justified by the literal datatype workaround in 'hext' format, which is a known, controlled workaround, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent and understandable.\n\n**Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by the known workaround for specific format issues, with no external or malicious activity involved.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite for RDF serialization round-tripping. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The minor risk score reflects the workaround for known format limitations, which is acceptable in a testing context.",
