{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite designed to exercise various features of the rdflib library, including querying and manipulating RDF graphs, and preparing queries for type checking.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hardcoded RDF triples added to the graph, and the RDF queries defined as string literals.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the results of graph.query() executions, where query results are processed and added to sets; also, the prepared query may be executed on the graph.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input RDF triples (sources) into the graph, then through SPARQL query processing (queries as input) to produce results, which are stored in sets and used for assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs an RDF graph with hardcoded URIs, literals, and blank nodes, then performs several SPARQL queries, including prepared queries, to verify data retrieval. The code uses standard rdflib features with no indication of malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the use of prepareQuery, but it is used here for type-checking and not executed dynamically. No data leaks, environment variable misuse, or external system interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign test suite for the rdflib library with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, file access, or system modification, nor does it contain hidden or obfuscated code. Overall, it is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
