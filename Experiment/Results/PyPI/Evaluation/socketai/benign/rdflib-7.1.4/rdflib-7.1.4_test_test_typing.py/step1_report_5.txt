{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite exercising features of the rdflib library for RDF graph operations, SPARQL queries, and data conversions, primarily for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded RDF data, predefined query strings, and namespace mappings. No external input or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external data transmissions are present. The code processes data locally within the RDF graph.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded RDF literals and nodes into queries and data assertions, with no indication of external untrusted input or data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The code is well-structured, uses standard library features, and appears purely for testing and validation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static test suite designed to validate rdflib's features and type safety under strict mypy checks. It creates RDF graphs, adds triples, performs SPARQL queries, and converts literals to Python native types. The code uses only static, hardcoded data and standard library functions. There is no evidence of dynamic data injection, external network activity, or malicious code snippets. All operations are confined to in-memory data structures with clear and benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-built test suite for rdflib functionalities with no malicious intent. It involves no external data or system modifications and adheres to safe coding practices.",
