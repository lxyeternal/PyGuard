{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of tests exercising rdflib RDF graph features, including adding triples, executing SPARQL queries, preparing queries, and type conversions, all with static data for validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded literals, URIs, and namespace mappings within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed; all operations are in-memory and static.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static literals and URIs into RDF graph operations, queries, and type conversions without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, in-memory test suite for rdflib, involving adding triples, querying with SPARQL, preparing queries, and converting literals to Python types. It contains no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The data and queries are hardcoded, and the purpose is validation and correctness testing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of prepareQuery() is standard for type checking and does not introduce risk. All operations are safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static test suite for rdflib with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and security risk at 0. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
