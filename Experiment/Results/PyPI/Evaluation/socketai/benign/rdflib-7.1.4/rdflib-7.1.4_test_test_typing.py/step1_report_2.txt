{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test and demonstrate features of the rdflib library for RDF graph handling, including query execution, namespace management, and type conversions.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded RDF data, predefined query strings, and namespace information. It also reads literals and nodes created within the script.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted input, nor does it send data externally or perform any network operations.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves creating RDF graph data (source), executing SPARQL queries (source), and converting literals to Python types (sink). There are no untrusted data flows leading to external effects or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly tests rdflib features; no user input or external data processing is involved.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an RDF graph with static data, runs several SPARQL queries, and processes the results. It uses prepared queries with namespace mappings and performs type conversions. There are no external inputs, network interactions, or sensitive data handling. All operations are contained within the script's context, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script serves as a unit test or demonstration for rdflib functionality, with no indications of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It handles only static data and internal processing.",
