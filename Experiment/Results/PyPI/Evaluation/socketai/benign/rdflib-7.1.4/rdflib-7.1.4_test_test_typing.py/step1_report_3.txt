{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite designed to exercise and verify features of the rdflib library related to RDF graph manipulation and SPARQL query execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string literals, RDF graph data, and query strings embedded within the source.",
  "sinks": "The code executes rdflib queries and manipulates RDF graphs in-memory; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from graph data initialization to querying, then processes results, and finally adds data back into the graph, all within controlled test context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and designed solely for testing rdflib features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports rdflib and related modules, constructs RDF graphs with predefined data, performs SPARQL queries, and verifies results with assertions. It prepares queries, executes them, and adds new triples based on query results. All operations are in-memory, with no external inputs, network activity, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected, and the code appears to be a benign test suite intended for library validation and correctness checks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, controlled test script for rdflib library features. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling beyond in-memory RDF data, and no security risks. It functions as a self-contained test suite with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
