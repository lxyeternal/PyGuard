  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily test setup code involving fixtures, mock servers, RDF graph parsing, and test marker configuration.\n- No report identifies any actual data flow from untrusted sources to sinks that could lead to malicious activity.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n- The use of `sys.addaudithook` is standard for audit logging, not malicious.\n- The code does not execute external commands, handle secrets, or process untrusted input during runtime.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and aligns with typical pytest fixture setup.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; the code is standard for test environment setup.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | No malicious activity, no data flows from untrusted sources, standard test setup. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | Same reasoning; no suspicious behaviors or security risks. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | No evidence of malicious intent; purely test infrastructure code. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | Standard fixture setup, no untrusted data processing or malicious patterns. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | No signs of malware or obfuscation; typical test configuration. |\n\n**All reports** consistently indicate benign code with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The use of `sys.addaudithook` is for audit logging, which is standard and not malicious.\n- The fixtures involve mock servers and static RDF data files, typical for testing.\n- No external data is processed or executed in a dangerous manner.\n- The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, external command calls, or secret handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the detailed review, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**This aligns with the reports' consensus and the code's nature.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard pytest test setup module with fixtures for HTTP servers, RDF graph parsing, and test marker configuration. It contains no malicious or security-compromising elements. The scores should all be zero, reflecting its benign purpose.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No security concerns or malicious activity are present.",
