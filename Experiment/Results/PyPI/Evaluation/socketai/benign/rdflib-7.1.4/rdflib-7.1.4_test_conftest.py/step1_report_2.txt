{
  "purpose": "This code sets up fixtures and configurations for testing a Python project using pytest, including HTTP servers, graph parsing, and test markers.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (sys, pytest, rdflib, custom utils), reads test data files (TEST_DATA_DIR / 'defined_namespaces/rdfs.ttl'), and receives input from pytest testing framework via fixtures.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is sys.addaudithook (though used here for audit hooks, not malicious), and the test framework's collection and marker modifications which could potentially be exploited if manipulated externally.",
  "flows": "Imports → fixture setup and registration → pytest collection modification based on EXTRA_MARKERS → potential execution of audit hooks via sys.addaudithook.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.addaudithook for audit logging is standard; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors or hardcoded secrets are present. No code injection, data leakage, or unsafe external calls detected. All operations are related to test setup and utility configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of test setup fixtures, configuration, and utility registration for pytest-based testing. No external data inputs are processed beyond standard file parsing. No network operations, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The use of audit hooks and server mocks is standard for testing environments. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test setup script, configuring fixtures and test markers without any malicious or security-compromising behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks beyond normal test infrastructure needs.",
