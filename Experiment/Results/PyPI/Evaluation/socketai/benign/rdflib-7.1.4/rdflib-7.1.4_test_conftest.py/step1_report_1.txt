{
  "purpose": "The code sets up fixtures and configurations for pytest testing framework, including HTTP servers, graph parsing, and test markers.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions; reads test data files; initializes server mocks and pytest fixtures; registers pytest plugins and markers.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data; no code that executes or stores untrusted input in a potentially dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; the data flows are limited to test setup and configuration, with no data processing or external command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard test setup code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of mock servers and fixtures is typical for testing environments.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines pytest fixtures for setting up test environments, such as HTTP servers, graph parsing, and marker assignment. It imports testing utilities and configures test markers. No execution of untrusted data, system commands, or malicious behaviors is observed. No obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or security risks are present. The code is well-structured and typical for a testing suite, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest testing setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed for test environment configuration and does not contain malicious or sabotage code.",
