{
  "purpose": "This code sets up fixtures and configuration for pytest testing, including HTTP server mocks, graph parsing, and test markers.",
  "sources": "Reads test data files (rdfs.ttl), imports modules, and initializes fixtures for testing environments.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations. No external data handling or output is evident.",
  "flows": "Fixture functions initialize mock servers and parse RDF graphs; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors identified. Use of standard testing libraries and fixtures is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines pytest fixtures for setting up test environments with HTTP servers, RDF graphs, and markers. It imports several testing utilities and third-party libraries (pytest, rdflib). The fixtures manage mock server lifecycle, graph parsing, and test marker annotations. There are no dynamic code evaluations, data injections, or network operations beyond test server setup. The code structure and imports are typical for test setups, and no malicious patterns or obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest test setup module without any malicious intent or security risks. It mainly facilitates testing infrastructure with no indicators of malicious behavior or security issues.",
