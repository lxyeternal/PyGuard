  "purpose": "Setup and configuration of pytest fixtures, mock servers, RDF graph parsing, and test markers for a testing environment.",
  "sources": "Imports of testing modules, static test data files, fixture definitions, and registration of test markers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processed or stored; no external data transmission or command execution.",
  "flows": "Fixtures initialize mock servers and parse static RDF data; no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward and standard for test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical pytest setup script involving fixtures for HTTP servers, RDF graph parsing, and test marker registration. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of sys.addaudithook is for audit logging, which is benign. No external commands, secrets, or untrusted data handling are present. The code's structure and content are consistent with safe testing infrastructure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard test setup module. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified.",
