{
  "purpose": "This code sets up pytest fixtures, utility imports, and configuration for testing a Python project, primarily involving HTTP servers, RDF graphs, and audit hooks.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (via sys), module imports, fixture initializations, and test data files (TEST_DATA_DIR / 'defined_namespaces/rdfs.ttl').",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data output, network connections, or file writes evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; fixture setup and imports do not process external untrusted input during execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, backdoors, or malicious constructs are detected. The code primarily manages test fixtures and imports. The use of sys.addaudithook is standard for audit purposes; no misuse observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules, sets up pytest fixtures for HTTP servers, RDF graph loading, audit hook dispatching, and test data management. It registers test markers for specific modules and functions. No code injection, hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be standard test setup code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a test setup with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It does not include any malicious payloads or suspicious constructs.",
