  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the described reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is predominantly setting up pytest fixtures, mock servers, RDF graph parsing, and test markers.\n- No untrusted data is being executed, stored insecurely, or transmitted.\n- The use of sys.addaudithook is standard for audit logging, not malicious.\n- No code injection, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution is evident.\n- The code appears to be typical test infrastructure setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly notes that the code is test setup, with no malicious activity.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)\n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Highlights the use of sys.addaudithook, which is standard.\n- Recognizes that no external data is processed maliciously.\n- No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the benign nature.\n- Correctly states no external data handling or malicious behavior.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with prior analysis.\n- No suspicious patterns or data flows.\n- Uses standard pytest fixtures and mocks.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly identifies the code as test setup.\n- No data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- No external data processing beyond static files and mocks.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- All reports consistently recognize that the code is a standard pytest test setup script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk all at 0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is purely infrastructure for testing, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The provided scores are accurate and justified based on the code's content and purpose.",
