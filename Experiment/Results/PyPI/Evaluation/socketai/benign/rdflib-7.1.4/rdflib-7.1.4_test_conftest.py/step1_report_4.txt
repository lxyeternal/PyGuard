{
  "purpose": "This code sets up testing fixtures and configuration for pytest, including HTTP servers, RDF graph parsing, and mock objects, to support testing a Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data, test data files (TTL RDF), and initializes various fixture objects. Also imports external modules such as sys, pytest, rdflib, and custom test utilities.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data directly; fixtures only instantiate server mocks and parse static files. No user input or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code primarily initializes and configures test fixtures and mocks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code adheres to standard pytest fixture setup and does not contain dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines session and function-scoped fixtures for HTTP servers, RDF graph parsing, and mock server management. It uses standard practices for setting up test environments. The fixtures manage external resources safely, with resets before each test. The code includes a pytest hook to add markers based on file locations, aiding test categorization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard test setup module for pytest, focusing on configuring test fixtures and resource management. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are identified. The code appears safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
