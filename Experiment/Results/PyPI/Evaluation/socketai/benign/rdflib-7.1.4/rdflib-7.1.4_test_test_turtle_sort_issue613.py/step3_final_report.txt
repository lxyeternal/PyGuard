{
  "purpose": "The code tests RDFLib's handling of dateTime and DocumentFragment literals by parsing static RDF strings and serializing them, primarily to observe sorting behaviors and known issues.",
  "sources": "Static RDF strings embedded in the code used as input data for rdflib.Graph().parse()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data, network activity, or data leakage points present",
  "flows": "Static RDF string -> parse() -> Graph object -> serialize() -> output RDF string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static data processing; no obfuscation or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions that parse predefined RDF data containing dateTime and HTML literals, then serialize the graph. It does not process user input, secrets, or external data. The comments reference known RDFLib issues but do not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose appears to be testing or demonstrating RDFLib's handling of specific data types. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports reflects the potential for handling untrusted RDF literals, but since the data is static and controlled, this risk is negligible. The malware score is correctly 0, and obfuscated score is 0. The confidence level is high (around 0.9-1) due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static test script for RDFLib, with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
