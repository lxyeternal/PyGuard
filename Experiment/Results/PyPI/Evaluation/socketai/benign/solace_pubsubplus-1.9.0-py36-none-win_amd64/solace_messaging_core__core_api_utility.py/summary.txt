  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard wrapper for a messaging SDK, with no malicious intent. The only potential concern is the misuse of 'session_force_failure' for disruption, but it is likely intended for testing purposes. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, assuming the native library is trusted."
