  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static variable assignments for version and build metadata.\n- The code is auto-generated or dynamically overwritten during build time, with placeholders indicating this process.\n- No user input, network operations, or data processing occurs.\n- No suspicious or malicious code constructs, obfuscation, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n- The code is standard for version tracking in software projects.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n\n- **Presence of build-time placeholders:** All reports mention placeholders replaced during build, which is typical and not suspicious.\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports indicate no obfuscation.\n- **Security risks:** No evidence of security risks beyond standard build metadata.\n\n**Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n\n- No issues or flaws are identified; the reports are consistent and thorough in dismissing any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The only minor note is that the build process involves placeholder replacement, but this is standard practice.\n\n**Scores and Reasoning:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified since there's no security concern.\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, static build metadata file with no active logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n- The presence of placeholders for build-time replacement is normal.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is benign, standard build metadata, and poses no security risk. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this as a harmless, standard version info file with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and the overall risk is negligible.",
