  "purpose": "Defines version and build information for the pubsubplus-python-client package, dynamically updated at build time.",
  "sources": "Build process or setup script that replaces placeholder values at build time.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data; only static assignment of version strings.",
  "flows": "Build-time data injection into version variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholders indicating build-time code generation; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant variable definitions for versioning information, with no user input, network operations, or data handling. It mentions that values are replaced at build time via setup.py, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be purely informational and part of the build process.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, purely informational, and used for version tracking. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
