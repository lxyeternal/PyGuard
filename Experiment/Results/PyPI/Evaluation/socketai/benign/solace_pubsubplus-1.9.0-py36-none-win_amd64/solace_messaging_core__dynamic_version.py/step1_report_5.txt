{
  "purpose": "Define version and build information for the pubsubplus-python-client library, used for messaging with Solace systems.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version, commit date, and build revision variables; these are set at build time and do not read untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; all variables are assigned static or build-time values without external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains comments indicating dynamic replacement at build time, which is standard for versioning; no suspicious or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of variable assignments for versioning metadata, intended to be overwritten during build time. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious code behavior. It is typical for build scripts to include such placeholders and comments, and this code does not exhibit any malicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This file is a benign, build-time version information module with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely stores static data about the client library version and build details.",
