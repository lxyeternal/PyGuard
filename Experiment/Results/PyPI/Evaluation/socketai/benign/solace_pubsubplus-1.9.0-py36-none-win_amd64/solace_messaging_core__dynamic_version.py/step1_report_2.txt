  "purpose": "This file contains version and build metadata for the pubsubplus-python-client library, used for package identification and version control.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded values assigned to variables for version, commit date, and build revision.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the file only assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of build-time placeholders indicates dynamic replacement, but no malicious or unusual behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static string values to variables that describe the package version, build date, and revision. These are meant for internal use and are replaced during the build process. There are no functions, user inputs, network operations, or code execution components. The comments clarify that the file is auto-generated during build time and do not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets beyond version info, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard build metadata with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply stores static version information for the package.",
