{
  "purpose": "The code defines version and build information for the pubsubplus-python-client library, used for communicating with Solace message brokers.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned with build-time replaced values: SOLACE_PYTHON_CLIENT_VERSION, SOLACE_PYTHON_CLIENT_COMMIT_DATE, SOLACE_PYTHON_CLIENT_BUILD_REV.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; these are static variable assignments for build metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static values assigned at build time.",
  "anomalies": "The code mentions dynamic replacement at build time, which is typical for version info. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only variable assignments with build metadata, replaced during the build process. No user input handling, data processing, or external communications are present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic detected. It appears to be a standard version info file, common in software projects.",
  "conclusion": "This file is a harmless, standard build information script that does not contain malware or security risks. It solely holds version and build metadata for the library.",
