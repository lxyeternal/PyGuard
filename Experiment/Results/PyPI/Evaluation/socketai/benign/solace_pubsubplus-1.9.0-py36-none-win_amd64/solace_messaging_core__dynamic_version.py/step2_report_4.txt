  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, potential risks, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of static variable assignments for version and build metadata.\n- Comments indicate that values are replaced at build time via setup.py or similar mechanisms.\n- There are no functions, user inputs, network operations, or data flows.\n- No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious code constructs are present.\n- The code is typical for versioning info in software projects.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is static build info.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, accurate.\n- **Security risk:** 0, correct.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly notes static assignment, build-time placeholder.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same observations as above; consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on build process and placeholders, correctly noting that the code is benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also correctly states that the code is static build info with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- All reports agree that the code is purely informational, generated during build time.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume the build process is secure and that the placeholders are replaced correctly.\n- No indication of malicious code or backdoors.\n- No signs of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the detailed analysis and the uniformity of the code, I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This code is benign, standard build metadata, with no security concerns.**",
