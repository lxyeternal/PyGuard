{
  "purpose": "This code provides static build and version metadata, with values replaced at build time, serving as informational identifiers for the package.",
  "sources": "The variables SOLACE_PYTHON_CLIENT_VERSION, SOLACE_PYTHON_CLIENT_COMMIT_DATE, and SOLACE_PYTHON_CLIENT_BUILD_REV, which are assigned static strings, are placeholders replaced during build time.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static values without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains placeholders for build-time replacement, which is standard; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for versioning information, with comments indicating build-time replacement. No functions, user inputs, network calls, or data processing are present. The variables are straightforward, and the code is typical for build metadata files. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. The code is benign and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless build metadata file containing no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
