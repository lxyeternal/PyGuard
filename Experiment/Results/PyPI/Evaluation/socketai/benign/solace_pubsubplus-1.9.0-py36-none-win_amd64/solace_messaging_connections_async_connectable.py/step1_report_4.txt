{
  "purpose": "Define an interface for asynchronous connection handling in a messaging service client library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'concurrent.futures' and 'abc' modules; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; code mainly defines abstract classes and method signatures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely establishes an interface without concrete implementations or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for an abstract base class in Python, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines abstract methods for asynchronous connect/disconnect operations, with no data handling, network calls, or credential management. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are evident. There are no embedded code injection points, data leaks, or backdoors. The code is purely structural, setting up an interface for other implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, benign interface definition with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply declares abstract methods for asynchronous connection management within a messaging client library.",
