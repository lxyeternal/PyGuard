{
  "purpose": "Define abstract interfaces for asynchronous connection handling in a messaging service client library.",
  "sources": "The code imports standard libraries and defines abstract classes and methods; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause a security issue, such as data leaks or command execution.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive operations; the code only defines interfaces with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines abstract base classes for asynchronous connection operations, including method signatures and documentation. It does not perform any input handling, network operations, or data processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. Usage of standard library modules and the absence of implementation details minimize concern for malicious intent. The structure is typical for a Python interface module.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides interface definitions without executable or data-processing code. It appears to be a standard, non-malicious part of a client SDK with no security concerns.",
