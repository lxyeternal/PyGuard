  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for asynchronous connection management in a messaging service SDK.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code contains only abstract method declarations with docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; abstract methods are placeholders without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward, well-documented interface with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a pure abstract class defining two methods for async connect/disconnect, with no implementation, data handling, or network activity. It uses only standard libraries and contains no embedded secrets or obfuscation. Multiple reviews confirm the absence of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign, structural nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign interface definition for asynchronous connection management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments are accurate and consistent. No further action required.",
