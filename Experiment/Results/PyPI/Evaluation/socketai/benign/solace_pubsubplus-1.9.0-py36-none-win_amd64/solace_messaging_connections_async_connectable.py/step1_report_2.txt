  "purpose": "Define abstract interfaces for asynchronous connection handling in a messaging service client.",
  "sources": "Import statements for concurrent.futures and abc; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines interfaces without concrete data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard for defining abstract classes and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines abstract classes with methods for asynchronous connect/disconnect operations. No data processing, input handling, or external data sources are present. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a straightforward interface definition for a client library, with proper licensing and comments. No suspicious constructs or activities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface definition for async messaging connections, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
