{
  "purpose": "The code provides an SDK for managing Solace PubSub+ messaging services, including session management, event handling, metrics, and transactional support. It facilitates connection setup, property updates, and resource creation for messaging applications.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionaries, user inputs for properties, session property modifications, external core libraries (solace.CORE_LIB), environment variables, and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Session property updates, network communication with the broker, logging outputs, event callbacks, and potential property modifications during reconnection.",
  "flows": "Input configurations are validated and used to initialize sessions; session state changes trigger event handlers; property updates flow through session modification calls; metrics are collected via external libraries; transactional methods invoke native session functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation techniques, or suspicious code patterns detected. External dependencies are standard for SDKs; no network domains or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured SDK managing connection lifecycle, event handling, metrics, and transactional operations for Solace PubSub+. Inputs are validated, external libraries are trusted, and no malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure, reflecting low risk primarily due to configuration misuse potential rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The SDK is legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain attack vectors. The low risk score appropriately reflects potential misconfiguration concerns but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
