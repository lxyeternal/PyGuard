  "purpose": "Utility class for enhancing logging messages with contextual id_info information.",
  "sources": "The process method retrieves id_info from kwargs or self.extra, which are internal variables; no external data inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code only formats log messages internally.",
  "flows": "Source is the retrieval of id_info; sink is the formatted log message with added context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string formatting with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of logging.LoggerAdapter that overrides the process method to prepend an id_info context to log messages. It does not process external inputs, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The implementation is simple, correct, and intended solely for structured logging. No security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured logging utility component with no security issues or malicious intent. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
