{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for retrieving, managing, and resetting session statistics by interfacing with a native C library ('solace.CORE_LIB') in a Python environment. It is intended for internal use within the Solace messaging SDK to facilitate performance monitoring and diagnostics.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'solace.CORE_LIB' functions such as 'solClient_session_getTxStats', 'solClient_session_getRxStats', 'solClient_session_getTxStat', 'solClient_session_getRxStat', and 'solClient_session_clearStats', which interact with session objects and statistics arrays.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only calls internal library functions and raises exceptions on errors, without external communication or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the session object ('session_p') through the library functions into local ctypes arrays ('tx_stats_p', 'rx_stats_p'), then the values are read and aggregated; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and performs standard operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions wrapping calls to a native C library for session statistics management. It performs error checking and exception raising appropriately. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process untrusted input, execute system commands, or transmit data externally. The interaction with native code is typical for performance monitoring modules and does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured internal utility module for managing session statistics in a Solace messaging client. It interacts solely with internal native library functions, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), which is justified given its internal, controlled nature.",
