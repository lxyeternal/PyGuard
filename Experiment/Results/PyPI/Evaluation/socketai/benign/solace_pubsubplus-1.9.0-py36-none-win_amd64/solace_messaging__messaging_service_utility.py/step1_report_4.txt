{
  "purpose": "This module provides internal utility functions for retrieving and managing messaging session statistics from the Solace messaging platform, including functions to get aggregate, transmitted, received statistics, and to reset statistics.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'solace' library functions such as 'solClient_session_getTxStats', 'solClient_session_getRxStats', 'solClient_session_getTxStat', 'solClient_session_getRxStat', and 'solClient_session_clearStats'. It also accesses imported constants and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write untrusted data or perform actions affecting system security, external network communications, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The functions retrieve data from the 'solace' library (source) and process or return it internally; no external data flows or outputs are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a utility module interfacing with a C library via ctypes, with no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The comments are descriptive, and the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts solely with the 'solace' messaging library to retrieve and reset session statistics. It uses ctypes to call native functions, handles error information, and performs basic arithmetic to sum specific statistics. No data is transmitted over the network, no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The functions serve as wrappers around the 'solace' library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code is typical for a library interface with proper exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module designed to interface with the 'solace' messaging library for session statistics management. It does not contain any malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It operates solely as an internal API wrapper without external data leaks or malicious actions.",
