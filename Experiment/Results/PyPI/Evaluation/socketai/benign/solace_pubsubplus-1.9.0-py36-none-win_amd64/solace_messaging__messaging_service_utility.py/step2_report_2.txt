  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code is a straightforward wrapper around C library functions for session statistics. No suspicious data flow or code.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified. The logic is consistent, and error handling is appropriate.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. The risk score is low, which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?** Not applicable; the score is 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score?** Correctly 0, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Claims based on assumptions?** No, the report correctly states that the code is safe.\n- **Score consistency?** Yes.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No, similar to Report 1, it's a safe wrapper around external library calls.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. This is appropriate.\n- **Malware justification?** Correctly 0.\n- **Claims?** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities assumed.\n- **Score consistency?** Yes.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code remains a typical utility for interacting with a C library.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The low risk score is justified.\n- **Malware justification?** Correct.\n- **Claims?** No suspicious activity.\n- **Score consistency?** Yes.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code is a standard internal utility.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The score aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Malware justification?** Correct.\n- **Claims?** No malicious behavior.\n- **Score consistency?** Yes.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code is a benign utility.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The low risk score is appropriate.\n- **Malware justification?** Correct.\n- **Claims?** No suspicious activity.\n- **Score consistency?** Yes.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), justified by the code's purpose as internal utility functions with no external risks.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\nGiven the nature of the code—purely internal wrappers around a well-defined external C library for session statistics—**there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk**.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the fact that it interacts with external native code, but this is standard and not risky)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.",
