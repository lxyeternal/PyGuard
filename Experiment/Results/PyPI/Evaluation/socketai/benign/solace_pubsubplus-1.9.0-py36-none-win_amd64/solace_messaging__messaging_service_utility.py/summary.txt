  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured internal utility module for managing session statistics in a Solace messaging client. It interacts solely with internal native library functions, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), which is justified given its internal, controlled nature."
