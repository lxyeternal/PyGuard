{
  "purpose": "This code provides internal utility functions for managing and retrieving statistics from a Solace messaging session, including functions to get aggregate, transmitted, received statistics, and to reset statistics.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'solace' library functions such as 'solClient_session_getTxStats', 'solClient_session_getRxStats', 'solClient_session_getTxStat', 'solClient_session_getRxStat', and 'solClient_session_clearStats'. It also accesses constants and utilities from imported modules within the 'solace' package.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks for untrusted data or user inputs. The code primarily interacts with internal library functions and constants, and raises exceptions based on error conditions. No data is transmitted over networks or stored insecurely within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves retrieving statistics via internal 'solace' library calls, checking types, accumulating stats, and returning the values. Error handling may raise exceptions if library calls fail.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs. It uses ctypes and internal library functions securely. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is an internal utility module focused on managing messaging session statistics through a native library. It includes functions for retrieving specific or aggregate statistics and clearing them, with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are typical for a metrics library. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies are present. The overall structure is standard for such a utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard internal utility for managing messaging session statistics in a Solace client. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. It appears safe and intended for legitimate metrics purposes.",
