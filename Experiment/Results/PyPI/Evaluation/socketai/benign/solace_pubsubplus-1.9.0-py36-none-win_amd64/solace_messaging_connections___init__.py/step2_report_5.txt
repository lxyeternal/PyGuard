  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports analyze snippets that are purely license headers or comments.\n- No executable code, data processing, input/output, or network activity is present.\n- All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious or suspicious content.\n- The confidence scores are all at 1, which is appropriate given the content.\n- The malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of any malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the above.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: License header.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- Justification: Correct.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above.\n- Correctly notes the absence of executable code or suspicious constructs.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- Justification: Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion.\n- No issues identified.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- Justification: Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above.\n- No anomalies.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- Justification: Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- Justification: Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nAll reports agree that there is no malicious code present. I concur; **malware = 0**.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nAll reports indicate no obfuscation. Since the snippet is only comments, **obfuscated = 0**.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nGiven the absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns, the overall security risk is negligible. **risk = 0**.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- No evidence suggests any hidden malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- The scores are consistent with the provided content.\n- No need to adjust any scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided snippets and reports, the code is purely licensing information with no executable or suspicious content. The scores are appropriate and should remain as:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
