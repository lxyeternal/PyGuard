{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes for synchronous messaging service connections with no implementation details, serving as an interface for connection management.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it primarily defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this code only declares abstract methods without concrete implementations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code strictly defines an interface with no embedded logic, network calls, or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of abstract class definitions for managing connection states and listeners in a messaging service. It contains no executable code, data processing, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code inclusion. It adheres to standard Python coding patterns for interface definitions and licensing. No obfuscation or suspicious features are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard interface definition for a messaging service connection, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger, properly maintained library intended for connection management.",
