  "purpose": "Define abstract interfaces for managing synchronous connections and reconnection event listeners in a messaging service client.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or handling of untrusted data present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code mainly defines interfaces and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures observed. The code is primarily interface definitions with standard method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes abstract base classes for managing messaging service connections, including methods for connecting, disconnecting, and handling reconnection listeners. No actual implementation or data handling occurs here. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code adheres to typical design patterns for interface definitions and contains no suspicious or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of abstract interface definitions for a messaging client, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is likely part of a larger, legitimate SDK. No malicious intent detected.",
