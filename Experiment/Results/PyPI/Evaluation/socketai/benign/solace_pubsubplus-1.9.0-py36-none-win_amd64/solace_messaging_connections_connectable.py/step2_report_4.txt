  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the provided code:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code consists solely of abstract class definitions with method signatures and descriptive docstrings.\n- No executable logic, data handling, network operations, or data flow is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be part of a legitimate SDK or API interface for a messaging client.\n- All reports consistently identify the code as standard interface definitions with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue-by-Issue Review**\n\n#### **1. Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Interface for synchronous connection management.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No issues found.\n\n#### **2. Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Defines abstract classes for connection handling.\n- **Analysis:** No external data handling, no anomalies, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment; the code is a standard interface.\n\n#### **3. Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Abstract classes for connection and reconnection management.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious behavior.\n\n#### **4. Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Interface for managing messaging service connections.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; safe interface code.\n\n#### **5. Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Abstract classes for connection management.\n- **Analysis:** No executable code, no data flow, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 (slightly higher, but still negligible).\n- **Conclusion:** The minor securityRisk score might be slightly overestimated given the code content. The code itself does not introduce any risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; I agree with a malware score of 0 across all.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all are 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the purely structural, interface-only nature of the code, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. The one report's 0.1 seems marginal and possibly overestimating the risk based solely on interface code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- The code is a standard set of abstract class definitions, typical for SDKs or API interfaces.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0** |\n\nThis reflects the code's benign, interface-only design with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
