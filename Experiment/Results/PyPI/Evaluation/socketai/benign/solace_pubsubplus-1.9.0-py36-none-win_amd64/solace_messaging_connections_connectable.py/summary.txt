  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign interface definition for a messaging SDK, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate, with a minor adjustment to the security risk score in report 5 to reflect the absence of actual security concerns."
