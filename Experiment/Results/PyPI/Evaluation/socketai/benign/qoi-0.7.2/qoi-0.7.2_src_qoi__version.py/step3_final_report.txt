  "purpose": "Assigns the version number of the package, serving as metadata for version tracking.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; simple assignment without external data or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward assignment with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal assignment of a version string to the __version__ variable. All reviews correctly identify it as benign, standard practice, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent across reports. No anomalies or suspicious activity are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its harmless nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assigned scores accurately reflect its harmless nature.",
