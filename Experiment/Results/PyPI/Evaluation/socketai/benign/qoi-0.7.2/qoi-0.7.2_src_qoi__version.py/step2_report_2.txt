  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no functions, or external interactions.\n   - The code snippet is standard for Python modules to specify version info.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Score Justification and Recommendations**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores align well with the analysis.\n\n4. **Assessment of Malware and Risk Scores**:\n   - The code is purely a metadata assignment, with no malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n   - The risk score of 0 is justified; there's no security concern here.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n   - Obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is straightforward and clear.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions and Claims**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They recognize that this is standard practice in Python packaging.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Final Estimation**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - Given the evidence, the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports: this is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns.",
