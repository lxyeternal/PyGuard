  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; only a version string assignment",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of assigning a version string to the variable __version__. This is a common practice in Python packages to specify the package version. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no suspicious code segments. The simplicity suggests it is standard metadata rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version assignment with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
