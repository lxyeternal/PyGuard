  "purpose": "The code imports version information and core functions/classes from the 'qoi' package related to image encoding/decoding.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading version info and functions from 'qoi' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports modules without data flow.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process data at runtime, only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is appropriately zero, as there are no malicious behaviors. The security risk score is minimal, reflecting the low threat level of import statements. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No further action or revision is necessary.",
