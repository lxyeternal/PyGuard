  "purpose": "Importing modules and functions from the 'qoi' package, likely for image encoding/decoding and version management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'qoi._version' and 'qoi.qoi' modules.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as the code only imports modules and functions; no runtime data flow is demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward imports without suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple import statements from a known package 'qoi', referencing version and core image processing functionalities. No code execution, data handling, or user input is present. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The imports are standard and intended for functionality related to image encoding/decoding.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import of a known package's modules and functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on these import statements alone.",
