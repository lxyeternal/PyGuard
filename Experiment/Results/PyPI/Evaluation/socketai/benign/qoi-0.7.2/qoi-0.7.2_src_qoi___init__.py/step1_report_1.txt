  "purpose": "Importing version information and functions related to QOI (Quite OK Image) image encoding/decoding.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing version info from qoi._version and functions from qoi.qoi",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in these import statements",
  "flows": "No data flow paths observable from the provided code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, referencing internal modules and functions related to QOI image processing. There are no dynamic code executions, untrusted data handling, or network activities. The code appears standard for a module that manages image encoding/decoding with version tracking. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward import of functions and version info related to QOI image processing. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
