  "purpose": "Importing functions and constants from the qoi package, likely for image encoding and decoding.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing the qoi._version and qoi.qoi modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; purely importing functions and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a standard, presumably open-source, image processing package. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are accessed. No functions are called, and no potential data leaks or malicious actions are visible. The code appears standard and intended for typical image encoding/decoding operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to import functions and version info from the qoi package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
