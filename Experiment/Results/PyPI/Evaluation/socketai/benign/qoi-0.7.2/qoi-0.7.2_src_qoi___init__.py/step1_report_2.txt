{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions and variables from the qoi package, likely for image encoding/decoding operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from package modules (qoi._version and qoi.qoi). No external input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data are present; no data processing or network operations are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports are shown.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code constructs. The imports appear straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific functions and variables from the qoi package, with no additional logic, input handling, or data processing shown. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities in these import statements. Without further context or code execution, the snippet appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple import statement from a known package, with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It likely serves as setup for further processing elsewhere.",
