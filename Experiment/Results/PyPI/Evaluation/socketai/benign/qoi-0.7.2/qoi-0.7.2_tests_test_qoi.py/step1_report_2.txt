{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the 'qoi' Python package, specifically testing read/write, encode/decode functionalities, and version retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads input images (RGBA, RGB), test parameters, and temporary file paths.",
  "sinks": "Reads from and writes to file paths; no data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed via qoi.write, qoi.encode, and qoi.decode functions; results are validated via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or obfuscation detected. No suspicious or malicious behaviors observed in test code.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard test functions utilizing the qoi library to encode, decode, and write image data. It uses parameterized tests to validate functionality. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious data handling detected. The code operates on local temporary files and data in-memory, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test suite for a Python image processing library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no backdoors, no data exfiltration, and performs standard testing operations. No security risks identified.",
