  "purpose": "This script benchmarks image encoding and decoding methods using various libraries and formats, including qoi, PIL, OpenCV, and skimage, for performance and similarity analysis.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command line arguments; image files loaded from disk (koi.png); potentially large arrays and encoded data in memory; external libraries such as cv2, PIL, skimage.",
  "sinks": "Data processed in memory (image data, encoded byte streams); no evident network transmission, file writing, or system modification; output primarily to console.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> command line args -> conditional library imports and function calls -> image loading (cv2.imread) -> encoding/decoding functions -> in-memory data manipulation and output to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of warnings for missing dependencies is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. No suspicious network or system access evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs performance benchmarking on image encoding/decoding, utilizing multiple libraries. It includes conditional imports to handle missing libraries gracefully, and processes images loaded from disk or generated. Data flows are confined to in-memory operations and console output. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward and aligned with standard benchmarking tasks. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate benchmarking utility for image processing performance and quality assessment. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this module. The code is focused on performance testing and comparison, with no external network activity or malicious payloads.",
