{
  "purpose": "This script benchmarks image encoding and decoding methods using various libraries and formats, with options for lossy and lossless compression, and outputs performance metrics.",
  "sources": "Reading image files (cv2.imread), loading modules (cv2, PIL, skimage), user input via command line arguments, reading image files from disk (koi.png).",
  "sinks": "Processing images in memory (cv2.imencode, cv2.imdecode, PIL Image saving/loading), printing output summaries, and potentially reading user-supplied regex patterns for images and formats.",
  "flows": "Input regex filters trigger image generation/loading, which then flows into encoding/decoding functions, with results being processed and printed. User arguments influence which image data are loaded and processed.",
  "anomalies": "The code loads images from a file 'koi.png' located relative to the script's directory, which could be an unintended data access point. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated code features detected. The script dynamically imports optional libraries without restricting functionality, but nothing malicious is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a benchmarking tool for image compression libraries, with optional support for OpenCV, PIL, and skimage. It loads images either generated (black, noise) or from a file ('koi.png') for testing. It times encoding/decoding processes, computes image similarity, and outputs formatted results. The code uses standard libraries and safe patterns for user input and file handling. No network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor behaviors are present. The image loading from a local file 'koi.png' could be unintended data access but does not constitute malicious behavior. All imported modules are standard or optional image processing libraries, with no suspicious code segments. The code appears to serve solely for benchmarking purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a performance benchmarking script for image encoding/decoding libraries. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It reads images from disk and user input, processes images securely, and outputs results without suspicious activities. No malware or malicious intent detected.",
