  "purpose": "This code configures the build process for a Python package with Cython extensions, managing dependencies and compilation options.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (USE_CYTHON), importing modules, reading 'requirements.txt' and 'requirements-dev.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variables (USE_CYTHON), reading requirements files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> build configuration; requirements files -> package dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of environment variables is standard for build options.",
  "analysis": "The script manages the compilation of Cython extensions, optionally using Cython if available or specified by environment variable. It handles conditional compilation directives, reads dependency files, and sets up build configurations. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity is evident. It does not perform any runtime data processing or external communications. Use of macros and environment variables is typical for build scripts. No obfuscated code, suspicious imports, or backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard build configuration script for a Python package with Cython extensions. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present. It functions solely to prepare the package build environment.",
