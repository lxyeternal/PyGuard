{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for building and installing a Python package with Cython extensions, managing dependencies and build options.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (USE_CYTHON), system info (sys.version_info, sys._is_gil_enabled), files ('requirements.txt', 'requirements-dev.txt'), source files ('src/qoi/qoi.pyx', 'src/qoi/implementation.c')",
  "sinks": "Reading dependency files (install_requires, dev_requires), reading environment variable USE_CYTHON, printing build info",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system info influence build options; source files are processed and converted; dependencies are read from files and passed to setup",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; use of standard build and dependency management patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for building Cython extensions. It reads environment variables to determine build options, processes source files for Cython compilation, and manages dependencies via external files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The use of environment variables and dependency files aligns with common package build practices. No anomalous or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate build configuration for a Python package involving Cython extensions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
