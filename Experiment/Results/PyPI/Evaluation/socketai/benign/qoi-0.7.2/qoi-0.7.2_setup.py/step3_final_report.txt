  "purpose": "Build configuration script for a Python package with optional Cython extension compilation, managing dependencies and build options.",
  "sources": "Environment variable USE_CYTHON, dependency files (requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt), source files for extensions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; standard build process with no data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and dependency file reads influence compilation directives; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for building a Python package with optional Cython support. It uses environment variables to toggle Cython compilation, reads dependencies from external files, and configures compilation directives based on system info. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The security risk and malware scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting the benign nature. Slightly elevated security risk scores (around 0.2) are justifiable due to reliance on environment variables and external files, but these do not constitute threats. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is straightforward and typical for such build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard build configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2). Overall, the code is safe and well-understood.",
