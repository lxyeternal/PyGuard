{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point that imports a module named 'command_line' and executes its 'main' function if the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__main__' module context and imports 'command_line'.",
  "sinks": "The only execution occurs via 'command_line.main()', which is a function call that could potentially contain sinks.",
  "flows": "The flow is: script run -> imports 'command_line' -> executes 'command_line.main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a simple entry point wrapper, delegating control to 'command_line.main()'. Since the actual logic resides in 'command_line', the security review depends on that module. The current script itself contains minimal code with standard structure and no suspicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python entry point that calls a main function from an imported module. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues within this fragment. Security risks depend entirely on the implementation of 'command_line.main()'.",
