  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python CLI entry point with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and justified by the lack of information about 'command_line.main()'. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent. No modifications are necessary based solely on this snippet."
