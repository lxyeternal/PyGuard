{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling ICMP ping errors such as time exceeded, destination unreachable, host unknown, and timeout.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for message formatting (ip_header, icmp_header, dest_addr, timeout) used to generate descriptive error messages.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted beyond message formatting within exception classes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into message construction during exception instantiation; no external data flow or network operations occur.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected; code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes with message formatting based on input parameters. No I/O, network activity, or data processing is present. The classes are simple, correctly implemented, and contain no suspicious or malicious logic. The scores assigned across reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No logical flaws or security concerns are evident. The code's purpose is purely for error handling in network utilities, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for ICMP ping error handling. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
