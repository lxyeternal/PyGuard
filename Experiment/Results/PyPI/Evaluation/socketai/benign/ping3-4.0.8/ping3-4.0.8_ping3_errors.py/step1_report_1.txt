  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various ICMP ping errors and related network issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from source to sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely defining exception classes with no suspicious logic or behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No external connections or data leaks are involved.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for ping-related errors, such as TimeExceeded, DestinationUnreachable, and HostUnknown. Each class initializes with optional message parameters and some include additional data like ip_header or dest_addr. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data leakage. The classes serve as structured error handling for network diagnostics and do not perform any I/O, network activity, or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions for network ping error handling with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified.",
