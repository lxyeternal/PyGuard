  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various ICMP ping error scenarios.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leakage or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; exception classes are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for different ping-related errors, each initializing with optional message parameters and context data like ip_header, icmp_header, or dest_addr. No input handling, network operations, or data processing occurs. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code is standard for defining exceptions and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of custom exception classes related to ICMP ping errors with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
