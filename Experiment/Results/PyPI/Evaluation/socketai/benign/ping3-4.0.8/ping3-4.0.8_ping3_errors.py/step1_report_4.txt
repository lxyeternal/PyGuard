  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various ICMP ping-related errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform any data output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for ICMP ping errors. It includes constructors that format messages based on provided parameters. No input handling, network communication, or data manipulation occurs. There are no hardcoded credentials, external data sources, or potentially malicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a larger ping utility or library, but itself contains no malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of exception class definitions for ping-related errors. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is safe and serves a straightforward purpose within a network utility context.",
