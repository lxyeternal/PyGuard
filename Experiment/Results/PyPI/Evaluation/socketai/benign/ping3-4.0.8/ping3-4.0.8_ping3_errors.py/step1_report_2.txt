{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various ICMP and ping-related error conditions.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from ip_header, icmp_header, dest_addr, and timeout parameters during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None of the exception classes or their methods perform data output or untrusted data handling that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (ip_header, dest_addr, timeout) flow into exception messages, but are only used for descriptive purposes in error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. The code primarily constructs error messages based on input parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for ICMP-related errors, such as TimeExceeded, DestinationUnreachable, and Timeout. These classes use input parameters to generate detailed error messages, but do not perform any data processing, network communication, or system manipulation. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Usage of input parameters is limited to descriptive message formatting, which does not pose security risks. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in ICMP or ping operations. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is benign and only used for error reporting purposes.",
