{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling different ICMP ping-related errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks, file operations, or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs within these class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward class inheritance with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for ICMP ping errors, with constructors setting message attributes based on input parameters. There is no use of external data sources, network connections, or any dynamic data handling that could be malicious. The message formatting uses input parameters only to generate exception messages, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of exception classes intended for error handling in ICMP ping operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code snippet.",
