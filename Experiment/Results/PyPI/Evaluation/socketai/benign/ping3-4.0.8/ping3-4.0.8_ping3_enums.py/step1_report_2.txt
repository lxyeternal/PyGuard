  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for various ICMP message types and codes used in network diagnostics and communication.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code defines constants and enums.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are no input/output operations or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code solely contains enum definitions and a constant.",
  "analysis": "The code provides definitions for ICMP message types and associated codes using Python enums. It does not contain input handling, network communication, or data processing logic. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and purely definitional.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard definition of ICMP message types and codes. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
