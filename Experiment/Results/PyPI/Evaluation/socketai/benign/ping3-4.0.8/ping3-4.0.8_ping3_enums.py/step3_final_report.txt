{
  "purpose": "Defines ICMP message types and related codes using Python enums for network protocol handling.",
  "sources": "Static enum definitions; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static definitions only; no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enum classes defining ICMP message types and codes. There are no dynamic operations, input/output, network communication, or obfuscated patterns. The code is clear, well-documented, and follows standard practices for protocol constants. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of protocol constants with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use in network applications, and the reports accurately reflect its nature.",
