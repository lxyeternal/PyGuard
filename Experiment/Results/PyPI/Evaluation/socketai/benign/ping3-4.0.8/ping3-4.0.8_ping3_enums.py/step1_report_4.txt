{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations for ICMP message types and codes used in network communication.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines static constants and enums.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only defines enums.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code is static and purely defining constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions and a constant assignment. It defines ICMP message types and specific codes for destination unreachable and time exceeded types. There are no input/output operations, no network communication, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be part of a network utility or packet handling library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, benign set of enum definitions for ICMP message types and related codes. It does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks.",
