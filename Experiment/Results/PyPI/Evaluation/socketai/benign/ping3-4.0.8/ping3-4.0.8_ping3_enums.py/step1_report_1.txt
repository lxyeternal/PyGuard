{
  "purpose": "Define ICMP message types and related codes using enums for network packet handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it solely defines constants and enums.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external output operations; no untrusted data handling or leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists as the code only declares enums and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the enum module and defines constants and enum classes representing ICMP message types and codes. These are static definitions used in network protocol processing. There are no dynamic or executable code segments, no data manipulation, and no external interactions. The structure is clear, well-documented, and typical for such definitions. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a static enumeration of ICMP message types and codes. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is a safe, standard implementation for protocol definitions.",
