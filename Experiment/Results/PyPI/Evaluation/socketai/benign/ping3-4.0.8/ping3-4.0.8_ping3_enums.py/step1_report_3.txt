{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations for ICMP message types and related codes used in network diagnostics and communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant values assigned to enums and a module import for 'enum'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the code only defines static enums.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is solely defining enums.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'enum' module and defines multiple classes for ICMP types and specific codes related to unreachable and time-exceeded ICMP messages. These classes serve as constants for network protocol handling. No input/output, data processing, or network communication occurs. The structure is straightforward, well-documented, and standard for defining protocol constants. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of enumerations for ICMP message types and codes. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and poses no security risks. It simply defines constants for use elsewhere in network-related applications.",
