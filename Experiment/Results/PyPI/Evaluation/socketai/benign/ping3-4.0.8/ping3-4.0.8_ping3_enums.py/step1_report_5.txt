  "purpose": "Define enumerations for ICMP message types and codes used in network communication.",
  "sources": "No input sources; code defines constants and enums.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward enum definitions with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and enums for ICMP message types and their associated codes, which are standard network protocol identifiers. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears to be a simple, static set of enumerations for protocol constants without dynamic behavior or embedded secrets. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard definition of ICMP protocol constants with no malicious intent or security risks.",
