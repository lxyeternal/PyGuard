  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, step-by-step, to verify their accuracy and consistency.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:\n   - The code only defines constants and enums for ICMP message types and related codes.\n   - There are no functions, input/output operations, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and uses standard Python enum classes.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it contain any suspicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, external dependencies beyond the standard library, or signs of malicious intent are present.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports' Reasoning**:\n   - All reports agree that this is a benign, protocol-defining code.\n   - They consistently state that the code is standard, static, and safe.\n   - The detailed enumeration classes match typical protocol definitions.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n   - The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - No issues are identified in the code or reports.\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n   - No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely definitional and static, there's no reason to assign any risk higher than 0.\n   - The clarity and documentation are appropriate, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- The scores are appropriate; all are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- The high confidence level is justified.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe set of protocol constants with no security concerns.",
