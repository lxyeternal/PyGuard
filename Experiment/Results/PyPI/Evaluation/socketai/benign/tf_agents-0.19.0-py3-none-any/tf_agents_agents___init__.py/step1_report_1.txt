{
  "purpose": "This module imports various agent classes from the tf_agents library for reinforcement learning.",
  "sources": "Imports from tf_agents.agents and specific agent classes from submodules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; simply importing classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for well-known library components related to reinforcement learning agents. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward and typical for a library module. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import module for reinforcement learning agents. It does not contain malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
