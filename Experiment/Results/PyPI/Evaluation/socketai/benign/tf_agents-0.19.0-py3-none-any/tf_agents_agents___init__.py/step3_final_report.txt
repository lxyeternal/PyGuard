{
  "purpose": "This module imports various agent classes from the tf_agents library for reinforcement learning applications.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from the tf_agents library and its submodules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules; there are no data flows or execution paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard license comments and static imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from a reputable open-source library, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. The license comments are standard and do not introduce security concerns. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious or pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency import module from the tf_agents library, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this assessment, and the scores are justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
