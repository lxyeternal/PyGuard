{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the TF-Agents library, specifically testing the existence of certain modules and attributes within the library.",
  "sources": "Imports the tensorflow library and the tf_agents package; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that handle untrusted data; primarily calls to check module attributes.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely accesses module attributes without any data processing or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only standard testing code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries and defines a test case to verify the presence of specific modules and attributes in tf_agents. The test case is straightforward and uses standard methods without dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No external data or network interactions are present. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate test script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard test script for verifying module attributes within the TF-Agents library. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or security vulnerabilities. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
