{
  "purpose": "The code is a test script for the TF-Agents library, verifying the existence of certain modules and attributes within the library.",
  "sources": "Imports of tensorflow and tf_agents libraries; no external or untrusted data sources used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling or network communications.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks; the code only accesses library attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. It is a straightforward unit test.",
  "analysis": "The script imports TensorFlow and tf_agents, then defines a test case class that verifies the existence of various attributes within the tf_agents library. It only performs attribute existence checks without any data manipulation, external communications, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are typical of a unit test, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for the tf_agents library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not perform any external network communication, data leakage, or harmful operations.",
