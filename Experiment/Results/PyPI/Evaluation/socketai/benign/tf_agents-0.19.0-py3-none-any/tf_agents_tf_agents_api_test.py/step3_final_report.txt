  "purpose": "A simple unit test verifying the existence of various modules and attributes within the tf_agents library.",
  "sources": "Static attribute checks within the tf_agents library modules.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only performs static attribute existence checks without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import and attribute checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test that imports tensorflow and tf_agents, then verifies the presence of specific modules and attributes. It performs static checks without any data input, output, network communication, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports concur that the code is safe, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless unit test for the tf_agents library, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
