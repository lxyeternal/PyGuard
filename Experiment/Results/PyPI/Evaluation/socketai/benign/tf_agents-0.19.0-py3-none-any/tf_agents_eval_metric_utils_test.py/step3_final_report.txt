  "purpose": "Unit test for tf_agents' metric_utils to verify correct computation of average return metrics using a stochastic reward function.",
  "sources": "Reward function using np.random.uniform() within the test environment setup.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; internal metric computation and environment simulation.",
  "flows": "Reward function generates rewards fed into the environment; metrics compute based on accumulated rewards.",
  "anomalies": "Use of np.random.uniform() introduces randomness but is standard in testing; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test case for tf_agents' metric utilities, involving environment simulation and reward accumulation. It uses a standard, benign random reward generator without external data, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The randomness is typical for testing purposes and does not pose security risks. The code's purpose is solely to verify metric calculation correctness, and all signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The use of randomness is typical in testing environments. Scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe and testing-only nature.",
