{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for computing, logging, and summarizing metrics within the TensorFlow Agents framework, primarily for reinforcement learning environments.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment.reset() for environment states, metrics objects for metric results, and optional callback functions. Data is retrieved from environment and metrics objects.",
  "sinks": "Results are stored in dictionaries and optionally written as summaries or logged. No direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment.reset() and metrics.result() to results dictionaries, with optional flows to logging and summary writers. No external network communication or untrusted data handling is detected.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hard-coded secrets, or obfuscated segments. The code uses standard TensorFlow and Python idioms. The import statements and functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard practices for reinforcement learning metrics computation within the TensorFlow ecosystem. It handles input sources like environment states and metrics objects, processes them through driver runs, and outputs results via dictionaries, logging, and summaries. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure and imported modules are consistent with normal usage in ML metric computation. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for metric computation and logging within the TensorFlow Agents framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation relies on standard libraries and practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
