  "purpose": "Utility functions for metrics collection, logging, and summaries within the TF-Agents reinforcement learning framework.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, including tensorflow, gin, tf_agents modules, and logging; no external data input or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, result dictionaries, and optional summaries; no external data exfiltration or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Metrics are computed and logged; no external data flows or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility classes and functions for computing, logging, and summarizing RL metrics. It uses standard libraries and follows typical patterns for such tasks. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The scoring aligns with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module for RL metrics in TF-Agents, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to its utility nature.",
