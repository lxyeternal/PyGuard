{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for metrics computation, logging, and summaries within TensorFlow Agents (TF-Agents) framework, primarily for reinforcement learning evaluation and monitoring.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads; uses environment and policy objects passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that send untrusted data externally; logging and summaries are for monitoring purposes only.",
  "flows": "Metrics are reset, computed via environment and policy, and results are returned; optional logging and summaries do not involve untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code leverages standard TF-Agents libraries and logging. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of evaluation utilities for reinforcement learning metrics within the TF-Agents framework. It involves no external input streams that could be malicious, and no network connections or file manipulations suggestive of data exfiltration. Logging and summaries are benign and used for monitoring. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious constructs identified. The code is clean, modular, and uses well-known libraries. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for metrics evaluation in reinforcement learning. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its structure and functionality align with standard practices in the TF-Agents ecosystem.",
