{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for metrics computation, logging, and summaries in reinforcement learning environments using TensorFlow and TF-Agents.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, absl, gin, tensorflow, tf_agents modules, and environment/policy objects passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network communication, file writes, or system modifications are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment resets and metric computations to logging and summaries, with no external or untrusted data influencing control flow or output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. Usage of external libraries (gin, tensorflow, tf_agents) appears legitimate and common for the context.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes and resets metrics, runs environment policies through drivers, and logs or summarizes results. All data inputs are parameters related to environment, policy, and metrics, with no handling of user input or external untrusted data. The functions perform standard evaluation and logging tasks. No network connections, file operations, or hidden behaviors are detected. Usage of standard machine learning library functions and metrics suggests benign intent. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for metrics evaluation and logging within reinforcement learning workflows. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this code segment.",
