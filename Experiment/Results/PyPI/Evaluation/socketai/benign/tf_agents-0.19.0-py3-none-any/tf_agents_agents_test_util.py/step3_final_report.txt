  "purpose": "A utility function for testing the consistency between loss() and train() outputs of a TensorFlow RL agent, ensuring structural and value equivalence.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: experience, weights, agent, and test utilities; internal calls to agent.loss() and agent.train().",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs; internal assertions and evaluations only.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (experience, weights) flow into agent.loss() and agent.train(); outputs are evaluated and compared for consistency.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing utility that performs internal assertions on the outputs of loss() and train() methods of a TensorFlow agent. It evaluates the outputs in both eager and graph modes, checks types, shapes, and values, and asserts their consistency. The code relies solely on trusted libraries and does not process untrusted external input beyond test parameters. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. It is a benign, well-structured testing function with no security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing utility for TensorFlow RL agents with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
