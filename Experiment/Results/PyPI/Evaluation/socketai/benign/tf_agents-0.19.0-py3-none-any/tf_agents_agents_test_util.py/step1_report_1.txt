  "purpose": "Utility function for testing loss and training outputs of a TensorFlow-based reinforcement learning agent.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (tensorflow, tf_agents), and function arguments such as experience and weights.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted input sources or insecure data sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code primarily performs internal tests and comparisons without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is standard for testing TensorFlow models.",
  "analysis": "The code imports trusted libraries, defines a function to test loss and train outputs of a TF-Agents RL agent. It performs internal comparisons of tensors and types, uses no external network calls, and does not process untrusted input data beyond function parameters meant for testing. The code is consistent with typical testing utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test utility for TensorFlow agents, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
