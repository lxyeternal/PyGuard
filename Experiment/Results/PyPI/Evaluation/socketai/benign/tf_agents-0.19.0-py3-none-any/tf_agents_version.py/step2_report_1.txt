  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - The code consists solely of static variable definitions, string concatenations, and license comments.\n   - No dynamic code execution, input/output operations, network activity, or data handling.\n   - The version components are hardcoded, and version strings are assembled via straightforward string joins.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or dynamic evaluation.\n   - No external data sources or sinks.\n   - No secret keys, tokens, or sensitive data.\n\n3. **Evaluation of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves solely for version management.\n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - Malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - Security risks are also rated as 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Anomalies:**\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of obfuscation.\n   - The code is typical for version information modules.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the clear code.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, justified by the absence of any security concerns.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious behavior.\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- The code is entirely benign and serves a typical purpose in software versioning.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, static version information module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
