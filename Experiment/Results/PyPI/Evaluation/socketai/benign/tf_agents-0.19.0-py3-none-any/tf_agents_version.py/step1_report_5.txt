  "purpose": "Define version information for TF-Agents library following semantic versioning.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version components (_MAJOR_VERSION, _MINOR_VERSION, _PATCH_VERSION, _DEV_SUFFIX, _REL_SUFFIX).",
  "sinks": "String concatenation to form version strings (__version__, __dev_version__, __rel_version__).",
  "flows": "Concatenation of version components into version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; straightforward version assignment and string joining.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily assigns static string values to version components and constructs version strings via string joining and formatting. It includes license comments and version metadata. There are no inputs, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no secret management or data handling that could be exploited. The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and intended solely for version information management.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a simple version info definition module with no external dependencies or suspicious features.",
