{
  "purpose": "Define version information for TF Agents library, including semantic versioning details.",
  "sources": "Constants defining version components (_MAJOR_VERSION, _MINOR_VERSION, etc.) and string join operations to construct version strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; all data is hardcoded or derived from constants.",
  "flows": "Constants are combined to generate version strings (__version__, __dev_version__, __rel_version__) without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines static version information for a software project. It uses only hardcoded constants and string concatenation to assemble version strings. There are no external data sources, user inputs, network operations, or file I/O. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The code is simple and transparent, serving a documentation/versioning purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely for version management. It contains no malware or security risks.",
