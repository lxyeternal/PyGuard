  "purpose": "Define and assemble version information strings for the TF-Agents library, including version components and release status.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version component variables (_MAJOR_VERSION, _MINOR_VERSION, _PATCH_VERSION, _DEV_SUFFIX, _REL_SUFFIX).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Concatenation of static strings to form version identifiers (__version__, __dev_version__, __rel_version__).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is static, straightforward, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines static version components and constructs version strings via simple string joins. It includes license comments and no dynamic or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's purpose is purely for version management, and all signals indicate a benign, standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version information module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. It is standard practice for version management and poses no threat.",
