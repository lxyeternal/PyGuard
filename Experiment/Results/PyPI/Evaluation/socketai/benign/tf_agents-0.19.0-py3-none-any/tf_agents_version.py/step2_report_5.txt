  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - The code is a straightforward version information module.\n   - It defines version components as static strings.\n   - It constructs version strings via string concatenation.\n   - It contains only license comments and no dynamic or external data handling.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no network activity, no code execution beyond string concatenation.\n   - No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no malicious code.\n\n2. **Potential Risks and Anomalies:**\n   - No evidence of malicious intent.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no external data sources, no secret management.\n   - The code's purpose is purely to define version info, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are reported or detected.\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, static version info definition.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is benign, typical for version management, and poses no security threat.",
