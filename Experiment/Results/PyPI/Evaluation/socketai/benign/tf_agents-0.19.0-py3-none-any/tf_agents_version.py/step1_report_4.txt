  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; version info is hardcoded and generated statically",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard version declaration patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable assignments defining version components and their concatenation into version strings. It includes license information and comments. There are no input sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for version information management with no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security issues. It is safe and normal for its purpose.",
