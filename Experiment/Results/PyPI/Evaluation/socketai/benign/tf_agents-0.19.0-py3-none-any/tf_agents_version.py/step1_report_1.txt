  "purpose": "Define version information for TF Agents library.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string components, license comments, and version assembly statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only constructs version strings from hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code solely manages version information.",
  "analysis": "The script contains licensing information, version component definitions, and string concatenation to produce version identifiers. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, nor any code that could be exploited maliciously. The code's structure is straightforward and intended for version management, not for executing or handling sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to define version information for the library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a typical, safe versioning module.",
