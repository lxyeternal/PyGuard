  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and only defines version strings using hardcoded constants and string concatenation. There are no signs of dynamic behavior, external data handling, or code execution. The code is benign and serves solely for version management.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is static, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.  \n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.  \n- The summaries are precise and aligned with the code's actual behavior.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, transparent code.  \n- Security risk scores are 0, justified because the code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.  \n- Confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- No issues warrant a higher risk score. The code is static, non-executable, and contains no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's purpose.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis**  \n- The malware scores are all 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.  \n- The code does not perform any operations that could be considered malicious, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's static nature.  \n- No speculative vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThis code is a standard version information module, with no dynamic or suspicious elements. It is safe, transparent, and free of security issues. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No modifications to scores are necessary. The code poses no security risk, malware threat, or obfuscation concern.",
