  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - The code consists solely of static variable definitions, string concatenations, and license comments.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no file handling, and no external data sources.\n   - The version strings are constructed from hardcoded constants, following standard practices for version management.\n\n2. **Potential for Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Given the static nature of the code, there is no indication of malicious logic.\n   - No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, and no dynamic or external dependencies are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and serves a documentation/versioning purpose.\n\n3. **Assessment of Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, with confidence scores of 1.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is solely for version information management.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the lack of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code does not contain any hidden or malicious constructs.\n   - The license comments and versioning logic are standard and safe.\n   - There is no reason to adjust the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, safe version management module with no security concerns.",
