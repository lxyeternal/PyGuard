  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version management script. It consists of hardcoded constants, string concatenations, and license comments, with no dynamic code, input/output, or external data handling.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**:  \n   The reports uniformly state there are no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or dynamic execution, which aligns with its purpose.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Data Flows**:  \n   No data flows from untrusted sources, no external data sinks, and no potential for data leaks or malicious payloads are observed.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the analysis. They also assign a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Misjudgments**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.  \n   - The code is standard for version management, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.  \n   - The scores reflect the analysis accurately.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - Since the code is static, with no external dependencies or inputs, the likelihood of malicious activity is negligible.  \n   - The version string construction is transparent and harmless.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate** after this review aligns with the reports:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code is safe, straightforward, and serves its purpose as a version info module.",
