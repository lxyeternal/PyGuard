{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a module for evaluation within the TF-Agents framework, likely used for machine learning or reinforcement learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'tf_agents.eval.metric_utils', which loads functionality from a third-party library.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; the code only imports a module.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is just importing a utility module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code present; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard header with licensing comments and an import statement. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or execution beyond importing a library. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The import is from a well-known library related to TensorFlow Agents, with no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It solely imports a utility module for evaluation purposes within the TF-Agents framework.",
