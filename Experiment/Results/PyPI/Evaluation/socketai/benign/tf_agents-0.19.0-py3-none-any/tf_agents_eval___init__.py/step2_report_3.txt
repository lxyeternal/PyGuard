  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code snippet:\n\n**Code Review:**\n- The code is a simple Python module with licensing comments and a single import statement:\n  ```python\n  from tf_agents.eval import metric_utils\n  ```\n- There are no functions, variables, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- The import is from an established open-source library (TF-Agents), which is widely used in reinforcement learning workflows.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n**Assessment of the Security Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and only involves importing a utility module.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted data, does not contain hardcoded secrets, and has no data flows or sinks that could lead to security risks.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, consistent with the straightforward import statement and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Logical and Reasoning Checks:**\n- The reports are consistent, thorough, and based on the actual code content.\n- They correctly interpret the code as a benign import statement from a reputable library.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are made without evidence.\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n- The code is a minimal, harmless import statement.\n- The environment (open-source, well-maintained library) further reduces any risk.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code snippet and reports indicate a standard, benign import from an open-source library with no security concerns. The scores are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code content.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
