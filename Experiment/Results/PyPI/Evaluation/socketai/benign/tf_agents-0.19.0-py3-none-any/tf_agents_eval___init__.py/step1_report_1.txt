{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of the TF-Agents library, likely used for evaluation metrics within reinforcement learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'metric_utils' module from the 'tf_agents.eval' package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only performs an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard import statement with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single import statement for a module within TensorFlow Agents. There are no data inputs, no data processing, and no outputs. The import appears legitimate and consistent with standard usage, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard, benign module import from an open-source library with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical for evaluation modules in machine learning libraries.",
