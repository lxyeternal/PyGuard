{
  "purpose": "The code is a module for evaluation purposes within the TF-Agents library, likely used for assessing machine learning models or agents.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'metric_utils' from 'tf_agents.eval', which is a third-party library component.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports a library component but does not process untrusted data; no data flows are visible.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing comments and a single import statement. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The file consists solely of licensing comments and a single import statement from a well-known open-source library. There are no functions, variables, or code logic that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The import is standard and expected in a module that performs evaluation tasks within the TF-Agents framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for an open-source evaluation module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
