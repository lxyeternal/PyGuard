  "purpose": "Import the metric_utils module from tf_agents.eval for evaluation purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from tf_agents.eval import metric_utils",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports a module",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow, input, or output operations are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard license comments and straightforward import statement",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single import statement importing 'metric_utils' from 'tf_agents.eval'. There are no functions, variables, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The import is from a reputable open-source library, and the code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, with high confidence and appropriate scores. No obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present. The code is typical for an evaluation module in a machine learning library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with licensing comments, posing no security threat or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
