{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the TF Agents library, ensuring TensorFlow is installed and meets version requirements, and then imports various modules from tf_agents.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version check, TensorFlow import, and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "The code flow is linear: check TensorFlow, import modules, cleanup namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a runtime version check for TensorFlow and exception handling, but no anomalies or suspicious logic beyond standard dependency management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment setup and dependency validation, including a runtime check for TensorFlow's presence and version. It uses try-except to handle import errors and raises appropriate exceptions if requirements are not met. No user input handling, data leaks, or suspicious network activity is present. The cleanup of symbols is for namespace hygiene. Overall, the code functions as a dependency setup script with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dependency verification and import setup script for the TF Agents library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no malware indications. It follows conventional patterns for dependency validation and module import management.",
