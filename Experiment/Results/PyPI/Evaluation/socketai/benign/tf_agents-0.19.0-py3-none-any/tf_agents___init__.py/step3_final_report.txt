{
  "purpose": "The code verifies TensorFlow installation and version, then imports various tf_agents modules, serving as a setup and dependency validation script.",
  "sources": "Import statements for tensorflow and tf_agents modules, version check, and print statements for error reporting.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; the code does not process external inputs or send data externally.",
  "flows": "The version check and import statements are straightforward; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard, with explicit version validation, import statements, and cleanup of internal symbols. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment validation by importing tensorflow and ensuring its version meets the minimum requirement. It handles import errors with informative messages. It then imports multiple tf_agents modules and cleans up internal helper symbols to prevent namespace pollution. The code is well-structured, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. The cleanup step is a common practice. No malicious or malicious-looking code is present. The version check is explicit and safe. Overall, the code is a benign setup script for dependency validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign dependency setup and validation script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
