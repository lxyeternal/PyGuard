  "purpose": "Assign a benign, standard version string to __version__ in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a direct assignment of a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the assignment is straightforward with no source-to-sink pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is minimal and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment statement setting __version__ to '3.1'. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code aligns with standard practices for version declaration in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The current scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
