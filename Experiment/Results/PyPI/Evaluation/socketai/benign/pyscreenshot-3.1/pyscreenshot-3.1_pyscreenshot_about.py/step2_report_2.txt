  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the reported code in the actual code snippet:**\n   - The original code is `__version__ = \"3.1\"`.\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - **Confirmed:** The code matches the description in all reports.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version declaration.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - They correctly note the absence of input, output, or malicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - **No changes needed** in scoring.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity (`malware`: 0) and no security risks (`securityRisk`: 0), raising these scores would be unjustified.\n   - The code is a standard version declaration, common in open source projects, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No obfuscated code, external calls, or data exfiltration.\n   - **Malware score remains 0**, which is correct.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize that assigning a version string is benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration, typical in Python packages.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
