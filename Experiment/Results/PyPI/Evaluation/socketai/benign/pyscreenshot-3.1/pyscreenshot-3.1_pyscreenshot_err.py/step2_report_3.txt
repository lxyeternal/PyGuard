  "review": "Let's review the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition inheriting from Exception.\n   - There are no signs of data input/output, external interactions, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that the code is a benign exception class.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - No false positives or negatives are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, data handling, or external interactions.\n   - Therefore, the risk score should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they accurately describe the code's behavior.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies noted.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Assessment:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign class definition serving as a custom exception. There are no security issues, malware, or obfuscation present.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
