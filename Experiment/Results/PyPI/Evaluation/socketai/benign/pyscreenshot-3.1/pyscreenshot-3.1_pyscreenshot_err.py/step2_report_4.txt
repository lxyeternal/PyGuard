  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**: All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition inheriting from Exception, with no data processing, input/output, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and serves as a custom exception.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**: No errors or flaws are evident in the reports. They all accurately describe the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions**: The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that there's no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**: The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Additional Considerations**:\n- Since the code is a simple class definition with no runtime behavior, dynamic code, or external dependencies, the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence score of 1 is appropriate given the clear, unambiguous nature of the code.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk**: 0 (no security risk associated with this simple class definition)\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, harmless custom exception class with no security concerns.",
