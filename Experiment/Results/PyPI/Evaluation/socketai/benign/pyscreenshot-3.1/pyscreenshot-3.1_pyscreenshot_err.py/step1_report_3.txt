  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious activity, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for an exception, inheriting from Exception. It contains no logic beyond class declaration, no data handling, no dynamic code, no hardcoded secrets, or external interactions. The code appears to be a standard pattern used in Python for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
