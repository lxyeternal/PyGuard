  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:  \n   The original code is a straightforward class definition:\n   ```python\n   class FailedBackendError(Exception):\n       pass\n   ```\n   All reports correctly identify that this is a simple custom exception class inheriting from `Exception`. There are no data input/output operations, no logic, no dynamic behavior, and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security issues. There are no logical errors or flawed reasoning in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - SecurityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports agree on zero malware and zero security risk, and the code is a benign class definition, the risk scores are justified at 0.0. There's no reason to elevate them.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a simple class definition with no malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
