  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare them with the code.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a single class: `class FailedBackendError(Exception): pass`\n   - No data input/output, no data flow, no dynamic behavior.\n   - No obfuscation, no secrets, no malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Issue Presence:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a straightforward custom exception class.\n   - No errors, flaws, or suspicious elements are present.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are indicated or suggested by the code.\n\n3. **Score Review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis and seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n   - No report suggests any reason to increase malware or security risk scores.\n   - Since the code is purely definitional and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns, scores of zero for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Logic and Reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and logical.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as a benign class definition.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the obvious.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - The scores are appropriate and justified.\n   - No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple, standard custom exception class with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
