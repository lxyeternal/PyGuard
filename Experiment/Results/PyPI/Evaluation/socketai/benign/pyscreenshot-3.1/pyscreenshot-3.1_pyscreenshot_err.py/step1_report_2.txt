  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling backend failure errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow since the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple class definition with no unusual or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class declaration for an exception named FailedBackendError. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions. The class inherits from Exception, which is standard practice for custom exceptions in Python. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. The simplicity suggests it's a straightforward exception definition intended for use elsewhere in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, harmless class definition for a custom exception. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies.",
