  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for backend failure errors.",
  "sources": "No data input/output, no external data sources, no environment variables, no network interactions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the class is a simple exception definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single class inheriting from Exception with a pass statement, indicating a custom exception. It contains no dynamic behavior, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, simple class with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0, confidence: 1—are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code poses no security threat or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
