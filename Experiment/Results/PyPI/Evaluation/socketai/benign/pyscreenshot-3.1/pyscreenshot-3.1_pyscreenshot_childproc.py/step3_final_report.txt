  "purpose": "Manage screenshot capturing via subprocess calls and process image data.",
  "sources": "External subprocess commands (`pyscreenshot.cli.print_backend_version`, `pyscreenshot.cli.grab`), input parameters (`backend`, `bbox`), and temporary files.",
  "sinks": "Reading image data from file, subprocess execution with external parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → subprocess commands → temporary file creation → reading image data → decoding.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code executes external CLI scripts to retrieve backend info and capture screenshots, managing temporary directories and reading image data. It constructs command-line arguments dynamically, which could be manipulated if inputs are malicious, but this is typical for such utilities. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. Error handling raises exceptions on subprocess failure. The subprocess commands rely on external scripts, but their safety cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code appears standard, benign, and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation for managing screenshots via subprocesses. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident. The low security risk score reflects typical concerns with external command execution but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities or malware.",
