{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encoding and decoding images to and from byte streams, likely for serialization or transmission purposes.",
  "sources": "The '_coder' function reads image data and converts it into a byte string; the '_decoder' function reads byte data and reconstructs an image.",
  "sinks": "The '_coder' function outputs image bytes; the '_decoder' function outputs an image object. These are not inherently security-sensitive sinks but can be used in contexts where image data might be maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Image object input to '_coder' -> byte data output; byte data input to '_decoder' -> image object output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for image serialization/deserialization.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python imaging library (PIL) functions to serialize images into PNG byte streams and deserialize byte streams back into images. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities such as insecure handling or malicious payloads. The functions are simple and do not perform any network operations, data leakage, or code injection. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements basic image encoding and decoding functions without any malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate utility for image processing, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
