{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode (save) and decode (load) images in PNG format using the PIL library, likely for serialization or transmission of image data.",
  "sources": "Input image object in _coder, input data (byte string) in _decoder",
  "sinks": "Decoded image object in _decoder, data returned by _coder (byte stream)",
  "flows": "Input image → _coder → byte stream; byte stream → _decoder → image object",
  "anomalies": "Commented out code that serializes image pixels directly, which could have been a security concern if used, but is inactive. No other anomalies or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: _coder, which serializes a PIL Image into PNG byte data, and _decoder, which reconstructs a PIL Image from byte data. The commented-out code suggests prior consideration of raw pixel serialization, which could have been risky but is inactive now. The active code uses standard PIL methods for saving and opening images. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or external network activity is present. The functions are straightforward image serialization/deserialization utilities. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or malicious payloads. The code appears safe and typical for image data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard image encoding and decoding utility using PIL, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The commented code, which could have posed risks, is inactive. Overall, it is benign and secure.",
