  "purpose": "Encode and decode images using PIL, converting images to byte streams and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Image object passed to _coder, byte data passed to _decoder",
  "sinks": "Byte stream output from _coder, image object output from _decoder",
  "flows": "Image object -> _coder -> byte stream -> _decoder -> image object",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code that handles raw pixel data; the active code simply converts images to PNG byte streams and back, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward image serialization and deserialization functions using PIL. The active functions '_coder' and '_decoder' use in-memory byte streams to convert images to PNG format and reconstruct images from byte data. The commented-out functions indicate prior attempts at raw pixel data handling, which are benign if inactive. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no unusual variable usage, and no hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard image encoding and decoding routines with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and appears to serve a legitimate purpose in image processing workflows.",
