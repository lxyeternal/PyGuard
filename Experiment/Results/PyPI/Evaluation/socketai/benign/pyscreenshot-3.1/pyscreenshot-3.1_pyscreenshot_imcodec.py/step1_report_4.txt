{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to encode and decode images using the PIL library, specifically converting images to bytes and reconstructing images from bytes.",
  "sources": "The functions read image objects in '_coder' and byte data in '_decoder'.",
  "sinks": "The byte data from '_coder' could potentially be used elsewhere; '_decoder' loads image data into PIL Image objects.",
  "flows": "Image object -> BytesIO stream -> bytes (in '_coder'); bytes -> BytesIO stream -> PIL Image (in '_decoder').",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. Commented-out code suggests previous alternative implementations but is not active.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward image serialization and deserialization functions. The active '_coder' function converts a PIL Image to PNG byte data, and '_decoder' reconstructs a PIL Image from byte data. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious code. Commented-out code shows an alternative approach to encode images to raw pixel data, which is not malicious but indicates prior experimentation. The functions themselves are standard image handling routines without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely for image data encoding/decoding without any malicious behavior. No security issues or malware are evident.",
