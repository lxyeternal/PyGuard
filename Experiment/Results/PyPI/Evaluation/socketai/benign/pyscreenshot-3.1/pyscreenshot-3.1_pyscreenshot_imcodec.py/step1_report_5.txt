{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and decode images using PIL, likely for serialization or transmission purposes.",
  "sources": "The `_coder` function reads image objects (`im`), and the `_decoder` function reads byte data (`data`).",
  "sinks": "The `_decoder` function writes image data to produce an image object. No untrusted data is written to external systems or files directly.",
  "flows": "Image object passed to `_coder` is serialized to bytes; byte data passed to `_decoder` is deserialized into an image object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code for image serialization/deserialization is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code offers basic image encoding/decoding functionality, converting images to byte streams and back. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior is evident. The commented-out code suggests previous attempts at different serialization methods, but as-is, it functions as a simple serializer. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or malicious logic. It is a standard utility code for image processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for image serialization/deserialization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
