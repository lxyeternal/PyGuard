  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to serialize and deserialize images using PNG format with PIL.",
  "sources": "Image object passed to _coder; data bytes passed to _decoder.",
  "sinks": "Image deserialization in _decoder; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input image -> _coder -> PNG byte stream -> _decoder -> Image object.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code handling raw pixel data, which is inactive; no active anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard PIL functions to save images to PNG bytes and load images from bytes. The commented code indicates prior handling of raw pixel data, which could have security implications if reactivated, but currently is inactive. The functions do not perform network operations, execute untrusted code, or handle secrets. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and typical for image processing tasks, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard image serialization utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of commented-out raw pixel handling suggests prior experimentation but does not impact current security posture. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate, though the risk score could be slightly lowered from 0.5 to around 0.1 to better reflect the benign nature.",
