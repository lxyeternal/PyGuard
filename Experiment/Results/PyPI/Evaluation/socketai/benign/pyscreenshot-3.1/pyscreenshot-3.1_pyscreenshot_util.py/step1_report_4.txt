{
  "purpose": "Provides platform detection, environment variable checks, version extraction, and subprocess execution for Python modules.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (DISPLAY, XDG_SESSION_TYPE), system information (sys.platform, sys.version_info, sys.executable), and program output via EasyProcess.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess execution via EasyProcess which can run arbitrary Python modules; environment variables could influence behavior but are only read, not modified.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to determine display usage; subprocess command uses sys.executable to run a Python module with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; code appears standard for platform detection and subprocess execution. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard system checks, environment variable reads, and subprocess execution of Python modules. It does not contain any hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious logic. The subprocess execution uses the current Python interpreter to run modules, which is typical and not inherently malicious. Environment variables are only read and not exploited for malicious purposes. No anomalies or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be utility functions for platform detection and subprocess management. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
