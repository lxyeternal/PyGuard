  "purpose": "Utility functions to detect platform type, environment variables, and run Python modules as subprocesses.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DISPLAY, XDG_SESSION_TYPE), sys.version_info, sys.platform, sys.executable",
  "sinks": "subprocess execution via EasyProcess with system commands",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> use_x_display; sys.version_info -> py_minor; sys.platform -> platform checks; sys.executable + module name -> run_mod_as_subproc",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides platform detection, environment variable checks, version extraction from text, and subprocess invocation. All functions perform standard, legitimate tasks with no signs of malicious intent. The subprocess call uses sys.executable to run modules, which is typical. Environment variables are read but not used in an insecure manner. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for platform detection, environment checking, and subprocess execution. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident based on this review.",
