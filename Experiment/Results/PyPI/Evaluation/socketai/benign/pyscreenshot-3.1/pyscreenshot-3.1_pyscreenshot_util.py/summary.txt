  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The only potential risk is misuse of the subprocess function if external inputs are not validated, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2) to reflect this potential misuse scenario. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, which correctly identify the benign nature and minimal risk."
