  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyscreenshot' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'about.py'; imports 'os.path'; defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no use of untrusted input data affecting security or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> supplies package metadata and dependencies for setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The code is standard for a setup script. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports modules, reads version info dynamically via exec, and configures package setup parameters. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or include suspicious code. Dependencies are clearly listed with version constraints. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected. The use of exec to read version info is common in setup scripts, with low risk. Overall, this appears to be a standard, benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks. No malware or malicious behaviors are present.",
