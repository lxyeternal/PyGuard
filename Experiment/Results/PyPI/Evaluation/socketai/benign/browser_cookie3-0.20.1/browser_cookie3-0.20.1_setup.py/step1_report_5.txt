  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'browser-cookie3' Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data, metadata, dependencies, and platform-specific conditions within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "Installation process and dependency resolution; no direct sink points for untrusted data or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from package metadata and dependencies to the installation process, but no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the dependency specifications include conditional platform-specific packages, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file for a Python package, containing package metadata, dependencies with environment markers, and an entry point. It does not perform any runtime actions beyond package configuration. Dependencies appear legitimate and relevant to browser cookie handling. No suspicious code, obfuscated elements, or malicious patterns are present. The conditional dependencies are standard for cross-platform compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for a legitimate package intended to load browser cookies. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The code is standard, with no suspicious anomalies.",
