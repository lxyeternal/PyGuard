{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'browser-cookie3' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a standard setup script with static data, no input or data reading functions.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous data handling in this script.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data propagation are present; the script only sets package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are detected. The code follows standard setup.py conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package details, dependencies, and entry points. The dependencies include cryptographic, database, and platform-specific libraries, but all are declared explicitly with conditions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. There are no input sources, no data flows, and no sinks that could be exploited maliciously. The code appears benign and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is used for packaging the 'browser-cookie3' library and includes no suspicious behaviors.",
