  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code in question is a standard `setup.py` script for a Python package, with no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, with confidence 1 and malware scores 0.\n- The dependencies are typical for a package that deals with browser cookies, cryptography, and platform-specific modules.\n- No code flow indicates any malicious activity, data leaks, or backdoors.\n- The reports do not identify any anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code is straightforward, with no evidence of issues or malicious content.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.\n- The dependency conditions are standard for platform-specific modules.\n- The `package_dir` parameter appears redundant because the package name matches the directory, but this is a minor style point, not a flaw.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Security risk:** 0\n  - **Confidence:** 1\n- These are consistent with the code content.\n\n### Justification for risk and malware scores:\n- Since the code is a benign setup script with no suspicious activity, scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or malware that are not evidenced.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- None identified. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks evident.\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe setup script is standard, benign, and free of security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The package setup appears safe and legitimate.",
