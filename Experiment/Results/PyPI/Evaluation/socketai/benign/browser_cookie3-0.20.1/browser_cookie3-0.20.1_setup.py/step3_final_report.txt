{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines the package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for the 'browser-cookie3' Python package, facilitating its distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata, dependency declarations with environment markers, and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the script does not handle external data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The script's flow involves defining package configuration; no data flows from sources to sinks as it is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package, with explicit dependencies and metadata. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. All dependencies are platform-specific but standard. The code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations. The dependency conditions are common for cross-platform support. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports accurately reflect this assessment. The package appears safe for use.",
