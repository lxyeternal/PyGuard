  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the setup.py configuration for the 'browser-cookie3' package.\n- They all conclude that the code is standard, benign, and free of malicious behaviors.\n- The code snippets are consistent across reports: straightforward setuptools configuration with conditional dependencies based on platform and Python version.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are mentioned or evident.\n- Dependencies are relevant and declared explicitly; no hidden or suspicious dependencies are noted.\n- No untrusted data handling, network operations, or other potential sinks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The actual code matches the descriptions; it's a typical setup.py with no hidden or suspicious code.\n- **Malicious code or backdoors:** None are present or implied.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent from the setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only point worth noting is the inclusion of platform-specific dependencies with environment markers. While standard, such dependencies could, in some cases, be exploited if malicious packages were involved. However, in this context, they are standard and well-documented.\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The dependency declarations are standard and appropriate.\n- The overall security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided setup.py code and the reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- No further action needed; the package appears safe.\n- The scores in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion,** the setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no security concerns.",
