  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'browser-cookie3' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static configuration data; no external input sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists; this is purely a package setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward package setup without obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution via setuptools. It specifies package contents, author info, description, URL, conditional dependencies based on platform and Python version, and a console script entry point. All code appears to be standard and in line with typical setup.py files. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident. Dependencies are relevant to the package purpose and are not suspicious. There are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
