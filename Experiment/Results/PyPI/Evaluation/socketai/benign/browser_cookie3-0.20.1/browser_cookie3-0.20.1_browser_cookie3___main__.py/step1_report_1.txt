{
  "purpose": "The script extracts browser cookies for specified domain and name, optionally outputting details in JSON format.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line arguments: domain, name, and optional flags; browser cookie data loaded via browser_cookie3.load() or specific browser functions.",
  "sinks": "Printing cookie value or JSON data; potential exposure if run in insecure environments or if sensitive cookies are displayed.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (domain, name, options) -> browser_cookie3.load() or specific browser functions -> filtering cookies -> output (print or json.dumps).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Code uses standard library and browser_cookie3 without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse to parse user input for domain, cookie name, and browser options. It loads cookies via browser_cookie3, which retrieves cookies from installed browsers, handling errors gracefully. It filters cookies based on domain and name, then outputs either the cookie value or full details in JSON. The code handles input validation and error cases appropriately. No malicious or suspicious code patterns, such as network transmission, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. It operates solely on user-provided parameters and local browser data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for extracting browser cookies with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks based on the current analysis.",
