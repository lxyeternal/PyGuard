  "purpose": "This script extracts browser cookies for a specified domain and cookie name, and optionally outputs the details in JSON format.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line input parameters (domain, name, browser options, file paths) and loads cookies via browser_cookie3.",
  "sinks": "Outputs cookie value or details to standard output based on user options.",
  "flows": "User inputs specify domain and cookie name; cookies are loaded based on browser options; matching cookies are output in specified format.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious dynamic execution or backdoors observed. The code relies on user input for sensitive data, which is expected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard argument parsing to gather input parameters, loads cookies securely via the browser_cookie3 library, and outputs cookie data. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or backdoor mechanisms. The logic is straightforward and typical for a cookie extraction tool. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code or behavior. Its design is for legitimate purposes, assuming the user intends to extract cookies for security testing or personal use. No anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cookie extraction utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on user input to specify target cookies and browsers, and outputs data accordingly. There is no malware, suspicious data leaks, or malicious logic present.",
