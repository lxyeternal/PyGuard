  "purpose": "Extracts browser cookies for specified domain and name, and outputs the cookie value or detailed info in JSON.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, and loads cookies from browser or specified cookie/key files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs cookie data to stdout, depending on user options.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> loading cookies -> filtering for specific domain and name -> outputting data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard command-line tool that uses 'browser_cookie3' to load cookies from browsers or files. It filters cookies by domain and name, then outputs the value or full details in JSON. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code only interacts with the user's browser cookie store and command-line output, which are typical behaviors for cookie extraction tools. No network connections, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with legitimate cookie management functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cookie extraction utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It handles cookie data securely and only outputs information based on user-specified filters. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
