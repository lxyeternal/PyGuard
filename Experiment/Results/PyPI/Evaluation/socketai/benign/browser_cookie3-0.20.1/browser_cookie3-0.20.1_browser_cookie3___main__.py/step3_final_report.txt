  "purpose": "Extract browser cookies for a specified domain and name, with options for JSON output and browser selection.",
  "sources": "User input arguments, browser_cookie3 library for loading cookies, optional cookie and key files.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (print), either cookie value or JSON details.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> cookie loading -> filtering cookies by domain and name -> outputting cookie data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for extracting cookies from supported browsers or specified files. It validates input arguments, loads cookies accordingly, and filters based on domain and name. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. Exception handling is appropriate, and output formatting is standard. The code does not perform network activity or system modifications. The potential security concern is the exposure of cookies if misused, but this is inherent to such tools and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard cookie extraction utility with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2—are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
