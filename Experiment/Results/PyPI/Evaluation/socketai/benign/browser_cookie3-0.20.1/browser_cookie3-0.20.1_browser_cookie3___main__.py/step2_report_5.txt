  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward utility for extracting cookies from browsers, based on user input.\n- It uses the 'browser_cookie3' library, which is standard for such tasks.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The primary security concern is potential exposure of sensitive cookies if run maliciously, but this is inherent to cookie extraction tools, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Legitimate cookie extraction.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, overall confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.\n- Security risk is set at 0.2, reflecting the potential for cookie leakage if misused, which is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- No issues. The reasoning and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Cookie extraction.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly lower security risk.\n- The analysis correctly states no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- Scores and reasoning are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Cookie extraction.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report emphasizes the absence of suspicious behaviors and states the code is legitimate.\n- The security risk score is appropriate, considering the potential exposure if misused.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- Well-founded and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Cookie extraction.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same reasoning applies; no malicious code detected.\n- The note about potential cookie exposure is valid but not indicative of malware.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- Appropriate scores and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Purpose: Cookie extraction.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same conclusion; no malicious behavior detected.\n- The security risk is acknowledged as inherent to cookie extraction tools.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **General Recommendations:**\n\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- Obfuscation is correctly scored as 0.\n- Security risk is set at 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting potential cookie exposure if misused, which is appropriate for such tools.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9), consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected or suspected).  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation).  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2, considering the potential for sensitive data exposure if misused.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (average of 0.1 and 0.2, acknowledging the inherent risks but no malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a legitimate cookie extraction utility with no malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The security risks are inherent to the nature of cookie extraction tools but are not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the scores or reasoning based on the provided code and reports.",
