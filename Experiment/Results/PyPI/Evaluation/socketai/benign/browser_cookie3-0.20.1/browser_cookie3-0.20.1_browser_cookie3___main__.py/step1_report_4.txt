{
  "purpose": "The script extracts browser cookies for a specified domain and cookie name, providing options for output format and browser selection.",
  "sources": "User input via command line arguments (--domain, --name, --json, --browser options, --cookie-file, --key-file).",
  "sinks": "Printing cookie values to standard output; potentially exposing sensitive cookie data if run maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input arguments determine the browser and cookie file sources; extracted cookies are matched against domain and name; matching cookies are output in plain text or JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. Usage of browser_cookie3 library is standard for cookie extraction; no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses the browser_cookie3 library to load cookies based on user input. It includes argument parsing for flexible browser and file options. The main function attempts to load cookies and outputs matching cookie data. The script does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration; it only prints cookie data. No anomalies such as hidden behaviors, backdoors, or malicious flows are observed. All inputs and outputs are consistent with legitimate cookie extraction use cases. The security implications relate only to the potential exposure of cookies if run maliciously, but this is typical for such tools and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard browser cookie extractor tool with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is designed for legitimate purposes, and while it can leak sensitive cookie data if misused, it does not contain malware or malicious code within its structure.",
