{
  "purpose": "The script extracts cookies from supported web browsers for a specified domain and cookie name, outputting the details either as plain text or JSON.",
  "sources": "User inputs through command-line arguments: domain, name, optional flags for browser selection, cookie file, key file, and output format.",
  "sinks": "Outputting cookie value or JSON data containing cookie details; no external data sinks like network connections or files are directly involved in the code shown.",
  "flows": "User provides domain and cookie name → arguments are parsed → browser cookies are loaded based on options → script filters cookies matching domain and name → outputs cookie data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious or unusual code patterns. Usage of browser_cookie3 is standard for cookie extraction; no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard libraries (argparse, json) and a well-known package (browser_cookie3) to access browser cookies. It carefully handles command-line arguments, including mutually exclusive options for browser selection, and validates input dependencies. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The script reads user input, loads cookies from browsers, filters by domain and name, and outputs data as specified, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate cookie extraction tool without malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard utility for extracting browser cookies based on user-specified criteria. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware signatures. The code is straightforward, uses common libraries, and follows standard practices without suspicious anomalies.",
