  "purpose": "Defines string constants for CSV report fields and test metadata in pytest-csv plugin.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments of string literals representing field names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flow; constants are used as labels or identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants used as labels or field identifiers. There are no functions, data processing, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The licensing comments are standard. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code is typical for configuration or constants modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of static constants with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. No further action is necessary.",
