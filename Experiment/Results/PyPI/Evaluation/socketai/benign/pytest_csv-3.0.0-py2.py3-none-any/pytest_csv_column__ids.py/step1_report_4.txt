  "purpose": "Define constants for CSV report fields related to pytest testing framework",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments defining CSV column headers",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output functions present",
  "flows": "N/A - constants are static values without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of constant string assignments used as identifiers for CSV columns in pytest reporting. It includes licensing comments and standard constant definitions. No code executes dynamic logic or handles untrusted data. The constants are static and directly assigned string literals. There are no obfuscation indicators, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration file defining constants for test report fields. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
