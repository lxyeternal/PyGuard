  "purpose": "Define string constants for a pytest CSV plugin to be used in testing and reporting.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; constants are statically defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static assignment of string constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant variable definitions representing field names or metadata used in the pytest-csv plugin. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of string constants used as labels or keys in the pytest-csv project. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
