  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a set of constant string variable definitions, primarily representing field names or labels used in CSV reports or test metadata.\n- The code includes licensing comments, which are standard and indicate good practice.\n- There are no functions, input/output operations, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data processing.\n- The constants are static, hardcoded string literals.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is just constant definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The reports are accurate; the code is straightforward and benign.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware: 0`\n  - `securityRisk: 0`\n  - `obfuscated: 0`  \n  These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports suggest any behavior that warrants a higher risk score. The code is static and harmless.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The malware score is correctly 0 in all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports are based on factual observations of the code's static nature.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code appears to be a simple constants module, typical in configuration or reporting components.\n- No signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- The licensing comments are standard and do not introduce any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe overall security assessment of this code is very low risk. It is a benign constants definition file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
