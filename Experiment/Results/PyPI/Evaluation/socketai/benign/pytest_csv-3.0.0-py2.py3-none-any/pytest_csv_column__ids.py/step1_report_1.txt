{
  "purpose": "This code defines constant string variables likely used for CSV data processing or test reporting within the pytest-csv plugin.",
  "sources": "Constants are initialized with static string values; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; only static variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for string constants representing field names or labels. There are no functions, input handling, external data processing, or dynamic behaviors. This is typical for configuration or constant definitions. The code appears to be part of a larger project that uses these constants for CSV reporting or test metadata. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. No security risks or malware indicators are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions intended for use as identifiers or labels. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. The presence of licensing comments indicates good software practice and transparency.",
