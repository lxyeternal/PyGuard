{
  "purpose": "These functions extract and format pytest test item and report metadata for reporting purposes, including node identifiers, status, markers, parameters, environment info, and test outcomes.",
  "sources": "Test item attributes (nodeid, location), report attributes (status, longrepr, duration), environment info (os.getcwd()), and test markers.",
  "sinks": "Formatted key-value pairs for reporting; no untrusted data sinks, no data exfiltration, no network or file system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test item/report attributes through formatting functions to output yields; no external or untrusted data influences system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward functions that extract test metadata and environment info, then yield formatted strings for reporting. All data sources are controlled test framework attributes or environment calls like os.getcwd(). No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies on standard libraries and utilities. The use of six and local modules is typical. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest utility module for extracting and formatting test metadata. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting minimal environmental info access. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
