{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate various columns for reporting test results in pytest, including metadata such as test node ID, module, class, function, status, duration, markers, parameters, and properties.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include test item attributes (nodeid, location, longrepr, etc.), report objects (status, duration, markers, user_properties), environment data (os.getcwd()), and test mark details.",
  "sinks": "Data is primarily formatted and yielded as strings for report output; no data is sent over the network or stored persistently within this code segment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test item attributes and report properties through formatting functions into yielded report columns; no external data or untrusted sources are processed in a way that affects system security.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The code relies on well-known pytest mechanisms and standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically extracts test metadata and formats it for reporting purposes, using standard Python and pytest conventions. It imports necessary modules, defines multiple data extraction functions, and handles different report statuses and attributes cleanly. No indicators of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are present. The only external interaction is fetching the current working directory, which is safe. There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The code is structured and documented for clarity, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest reporting utility module focused on formatting and outputting test metadata. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its design and implementation are consistent with legitimate testing report generation. The overall security risk is minimal.",
