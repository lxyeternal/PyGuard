{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple functions to extract and yield various test metadata and properties for reporting purposes within pytest.",
  "sources": "Data sources include test item attributes such as nodeid, location, and report object properties, as well as environment information like current working directory.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the yields which output test metadata; however, these are standard for test reporting and do not directly lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test item attributes and report objects through the functions to output formatted test information; no untrusted external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The code primarily consists of data extraction and formatting functions, with no network, file modification, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and local modules, then defines multiple functions to extract specific test-related data such as node id components, status, duration, markers, parameters, properties, and environment info. All data sources are test framework attributes, and the functions yield formatted information. No external data input, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to be a straightforward test reporting utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for collecting and reporting pytest test metadata. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or security vulnerabilities. It only formats and outputs test information for reporting purposes.",
