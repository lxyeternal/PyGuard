  "purpose": "Define constants for test statuses and include license comments.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments (PASSED, FAILED, ERROR, SKIPPED, XPASSED, XFAILED). License comments and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; static constant definitions and comments, no data flow or external input.",
  "flows": "No data flows; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with license comments and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and simple string constants representing test statuses. There are no dynamic elements, input/output handling, external data dependencies, or obfuscated code. The constants are standard and benign. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is static and straightforward, with no data flows or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of constant definitions with licensing comments. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or revision is necessary.",
