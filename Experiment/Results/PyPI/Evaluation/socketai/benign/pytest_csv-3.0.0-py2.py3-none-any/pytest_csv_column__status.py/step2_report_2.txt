  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is purely declarative, consisting of comments, license information, and simple string constant definitions.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, input/output handling, external data processing, or obfuscated code.\n   - No embedded payloads, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for defining test status constants.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and non-malicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated nature of the code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The code is static and contains no external dependencies or inputs, so there are no vulnerabilities based on the code itself.\n   - The only consideration might be if the constants were manipulated elsewhere, but based on this code snippet alone, there is no risk.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriately reflect the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, harmless set of constant definitions with licensing comments. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, non-malicious, and does not pose any security threat.",
