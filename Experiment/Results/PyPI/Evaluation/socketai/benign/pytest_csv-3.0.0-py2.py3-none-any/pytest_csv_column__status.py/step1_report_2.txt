  "purpose": "This code provides licensing and attribution information for the pytest-csv project, defining status constants.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines string constants and comments.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, external calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code is purely declarative and comment-based.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior are present. The code consists of license comments and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing information and defines several string constants related to test statuses. It contains only comments and straightforward constant assignments, with no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of licensing comments and constant definitions for test status labels. There is no malicious behavior, security risk, or obfuscation detected.",
