  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and license information for the pytest-csv project, defining constants for test result statuses.",
  "sources": "Constants definitions for test result statuses such as PASSED, FAILED, ERROR, SKIPPED, XPASSED, XFAILED.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, containing only constant definitions and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely informational, consisting of comments, license text, and constant string definitions. No input/output handling, no external data sources, and no dynamic code execution are present. The license information is standard, and constants are typical for a testing framework. No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard module that defines constants for test result statuses and includes license information. It does not contain any malicious or security-risk code.",
