  "purpose": "This code defines constants for test result statuses in a testing framework, specifically related to pytest and CSV output handling.",
  "sources": "No input sources; all constants are predefined string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted input or produce output beyond defining constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely declarative with no logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward constant definitions with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments explaining the license and purpose, followed by simple string constant definitions for test status indicators. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, or data processing. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, license-related constant definitions for a pytest plugin. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
