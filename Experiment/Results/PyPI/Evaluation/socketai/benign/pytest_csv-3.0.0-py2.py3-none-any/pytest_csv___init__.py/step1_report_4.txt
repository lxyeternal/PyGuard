  "purpose": "Provide metadata and licensing information for the pytest-csv plugin, including authorship, licensing, and project details.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments defining metadata (__prog__, __author__, __email__, __url__, __copyright__, __license__, __description__, __keywords__, __version__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects external systems or data leaks; only static data definitions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static strings to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is a standard metadata header.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and variable assignments for project metadata, licensing, and author information. There are no functions, input handling, or external communications. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The presence of licensing comments and metadata indicates a typical open-source project header.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign metadata header for an open-source Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious code. It is a standard practice to include such metadata in Python modules.",
