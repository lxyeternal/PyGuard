  "sources": "Static variable assignments and comments containing project metadata",
  "sinks": "None; no data input or output handling present",
  "flows": "None; code contains only static metadata without data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward metadata and comments",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments defining project metadata and licensing comments. There are no executable statements, data processing, input handling, or network interactions. The code is standard for open-source project headers, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, with high confidence, reflecting the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard project header containing only metadata and licensing information. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
