  "sources": "No input sources; all data are hardcoded string literals and metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there is no execution of untrusted data or external system calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code only assigns string literals to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is purely declarative with license and author info, no executable logic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of comments and variable assignments that store project metadata. It does not process any input, perform network communication, or execute dynamic code. The license and author info are standard and do not pose any security risk. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only project metadata and licensing comments. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected.",
