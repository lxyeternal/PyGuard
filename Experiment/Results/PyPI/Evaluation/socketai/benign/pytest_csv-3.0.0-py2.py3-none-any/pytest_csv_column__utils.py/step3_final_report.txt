  "sources": "Regex pattern matching, getpass.getuser(), os.path.expanduser(), item attributes (__doc__, callspec.params, iter_markers, keywords).",
  "sinks": "Internal data handling; no external network, file, or system modifications involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Parsing node IDs, retrieving environment info, accessing test item attributes, formatting markers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries and practices for test metadata parsing and environment info retrieval. Exception handling is appropriate. No external communication or data exfiltration occurs. Regex parsing is straightforward. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The functions are typical for test utility modules and do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for pytest testing environments. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are accurate and justified.",
