  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or output; no external network or file operations with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input from getpass, environment variables, regex matching, test item attributes flow to formatting and returning functions without external or malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or backdoors; use of exception handling in get_user, but benign in context.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions used for parsing test node IDs, retrieving user info, test documentation, arguments, and markers. It performs regex parsing, environment inspection, and data formatting. No external network, file, or sensitive data handling that could be malicious. The functions use standard libraries and follow typical patterns. There is no indication of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, with proper exception handling where needed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility functions for pytest plugin development, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
