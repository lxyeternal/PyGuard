  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for parsing and extracting information related to pytest test nodes, including node IDs, user information, test documentation, test arguments, and markers.",
  "sources": "Reads data from system environment (getpass, os), regex pattern matching, and test item attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes user information via getpass.getuser() and os.path.basename(os.path.expanduser('~')). No data is sent externally or used maliciously within this code.",
  "flows": "User info and environment data are retrieved and returned; no external communication or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of try-except for get_user() is normal fallback behavior. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and defines functions to parse node IDs, get current user info, retrieve test documentation, args, and markers. The regex pattern is used for parsing node IDs, and the functions handle exceptions gracefully. No external data transmission, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code relies solely on standard library functions and typical test utility patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for pytest test data extraction. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
