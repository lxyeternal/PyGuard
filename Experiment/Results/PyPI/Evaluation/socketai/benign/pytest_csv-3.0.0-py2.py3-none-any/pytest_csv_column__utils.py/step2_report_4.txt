  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, security risks, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for parsing pytest node IDs, retrieving user info, test documentation, arguments, and markers. Uses standard libraries, no external network or file operations with untrusted data.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The functions are standard and do not handle untrusted data in a risky way.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions for parsing test data, with safe data handling. No suspicious code or external communication.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature as benign test utilities. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for pytest test item info extraction, with safe environment data access. No external data leaks or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with exception handling and no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Functions for parsing pytest node IDs, user info, and test metadata, all standard operations. No external communication or data leaks.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Uses environment info and test attributes.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, straightforward, and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified because the code performs benign utility functions without security implications.\n\n**Final estimation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a standard, well-written utility module for pytest plugins, with no security concerns or malicious behavior.",
