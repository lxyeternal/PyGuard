      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign pytest plugin for CSV reporting. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal and primarily related to user-controlled file paths, which is standard for such tools. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the low potential for misuse but no actual threat."

The import of get_user does not imply malicious intent, and the code appears to be a standard setup component. All reports' scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score (0)."
