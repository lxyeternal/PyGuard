{
  "purpose": "The code provides a custom CSV reporter for pytest, generating CSV test reports with specified columns, delimiters, and quoting characters.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters (csv_path, columns, delimiter, quote_char) during initialization and accesses report data during pytest hooks.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file specified by csv_path; potentially unsafe if path is manipulated externally. No other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters → Data collection during pytest hooks → Data stored in self._rows → Final CSV file writing in pytest_sessionfinish.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code dynamically writes to a user-specified file, which is standard for report generation. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a pytest plugin component that captures test report data and writes it to a CSV file. It uses standard Python libraries (csv, os, six) and pytest hooks. It does not include any network access, code injection, or malicious behavior. The dynamic file path could be misused if user-controlled, but as a standard reporting feature, it is not inherently malicious. No unusual or suspicious logic, no embedded obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. The code appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest CSV report generator with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It solely handles report data collection and writing to a CSV file, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
