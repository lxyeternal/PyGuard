  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code contains only function definitions with extensive documentation. No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security Risk:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (default low risk). Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0.5 seems slightly high; a score of 0 is more appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is purely documentation and function signatures without logic.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low; no external data or security-sensitive operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low). This seems appropriate, perhaps even 0, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative measure.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—functions are placeholders with documentation, no logic.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** Minimal.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns well with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, straightforward plugin interface code with detailed docstrings, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, standard plugin setup code with no suspicious features.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security Risk:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are consistent; no malicious activity detected. The malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated code:** No obfuscation detected; scores should be 0.\n- **Risk score:** Since all code is documentation and plugin interface setup, the overall security risk is negligible. The risk scores should be 0 or very close to it.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a benign code snippet, serving as plugin interface documentation and hooks for pytest. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.",
