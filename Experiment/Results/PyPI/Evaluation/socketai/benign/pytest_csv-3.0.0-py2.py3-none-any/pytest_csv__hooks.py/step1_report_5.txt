{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions related to registering CSV columns and handling CSV write events for the pytest-csv plugin, facilitating customization and reporting.",
  "sources": "The functions are called during plugin initialization and after CSV file writing, which can be triggered by test runs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that process untrusted data directly; it mainly sets up configurations and callbacks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; functions are invoked as hooks during test execution or CSV output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and appears standard for plugin setup.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions: one for registering custom columns in the pytest CSV plugin, allowing users to add or override columns, and another for handling actions after CSV files are written. The functions contain detailed docstrings explaining their intended use, including examples. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. All operations are related to configuration and reporting, with no external data transmissions or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard plugin configuration code for pytest-csv with no malicious intent or security issues. It is safe, well-structured, and intended to extend reporting capabilities. No malware or security risks are detected.",
