{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for a pytest plugin that registers custom CSV columns and handles CSV writing events.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it is purely defining functions and documentation.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling points; the functions do not process or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the functions are static and primarily serve as callbacks with no data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present; the code is straightforward documentation and function definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions, 'pytest_csv_register_columns' and 'pytest_csv_written', intended as plugin hooks for pytest. These functions contain only docstrings and no executable or malicious code. The functions serve as interfaces for plugin extensions and callbacks without processing untrusted data or performing any operations beyond documentation. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard plugin interface code for pytest with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as documentation and placeholder callbacks for plugin extensions. No security issues, malware, or anomalies are detected.",
