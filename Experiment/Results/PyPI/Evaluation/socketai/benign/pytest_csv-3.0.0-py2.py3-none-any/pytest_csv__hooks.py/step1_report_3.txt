{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for registering custom CSV columns and handling CSV write events for a pytest plugin related to CSV reporting.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present; functions accept parameters (columns dictionary, csv_path) passed by pytest framework.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; no data is written, transmitted, or processed insecurely within the code.",
  "flows": "The code defines registration and callback functions invoked by pytest framework; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The functions are straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two functions: pytest_csv_register_columns, which allows adding custom columns to CSV output by modifying a dictionary; and pytest_csv_written, which signals when a CSV file has been written. Both functions are designed as hooks for a pytest plugin. There are no external data inputs or outputs handled within these functions that could lead to security issues. The code uses clear, standard patterns for plugin configuration and event handling. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of pytest plugin hooks for CSV report customization and event notification. It does not contain any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities based on the provided code.",
