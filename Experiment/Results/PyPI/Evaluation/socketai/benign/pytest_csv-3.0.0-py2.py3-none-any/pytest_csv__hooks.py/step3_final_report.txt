{
  "purpose": "These functions serve as plugin hooks for registering CSV columns and handling CSV file writing events in pytest, primarily for plugin configuration and extension.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines functions with docstrings but no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows leading to potential data leaks or external effects, as the code contains only function definitions with no executable logic.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the functions are placeholders for plugin registration and event handling without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are present; the code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of function definitions with detailed docstrings explaining their purpose. There is no executable logic, data handling, network activity, or external interactions. The functions are designed for plugin configuration and event callbacks, which are standard and benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The minimal risk score (0.1) in some reports is justified as the code could be extended or misused if modified, but as-is, it remains safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard plugin interface code with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
