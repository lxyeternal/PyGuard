{
  "purpose": "The code defines two functions related to a pytest plugin for CSV reporting: registering columns and handling CSV write completion.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters 'columns' (a dictionary) and 'csv_path' (a string). No external input or untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sensitive data output, network communication, or file modifications are directly present. The functions perform registration and callback handling without writing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "The code accepts data via parameters and stores or passes it to callbacks; there are no transformations or flows leading to potentially malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward and well-commented, following typical plugin registration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions for a pytest plugin: one for registering custom CSV columns, and another for signaling when a CSV file has been written. Both functions are documentation and callback handlers without any data processing logic or external data interactions. There are no network calls, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious logic, nor storage of sensitive information. The code appears to be standard plugin setup code, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard plugin registration and callback handling for pytest CSV reporting, with no malicious behavior detected. It performs no network, file modification, or secret handling beyond documented callback invocations. Overall, it presents no security risks or malware indications.",
