{
  "purpose": "This code provides plugin functions for pytest-csv, allowing users to register custom CSV columns and handle post-writing events.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'columns' dictionary in pytest_csv_register_columns, 'csv_path' in pytest_csv_written",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform potentially harmful actions are present",
  "flows": "User-provided functions (columns) are stored in the 'columns' dictionary and invoked during pytest execution; 'csv_path' is used after CSV writing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed; code primarily contains documentation and straightforward function definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for pytest plugin: one to register CSV columns with user-defined logic, and another to handle events after CSV files are written. It includes extensive docstrings explaining usage, which are static documentation. There is no data manipulation, external network calls, or execution of untrusted code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The code appears to be standard plugin setup code for pytest, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard pytest plugin interface for CSV reporting with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an extension point for users to customize CSV output. The code is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscated logic.",
