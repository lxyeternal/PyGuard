{
  "purpose": "Constructs a registry mapping column identifiers to functions or data sources for pytest reporting, including system and user info.",
  "sources": "platform module functions (node, system, release, version, python_implementation, python_version), get_user() utility function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data is used internally for reporting",
  "flows": "System info and user info functions are called and their outputs stored in the registry dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard modules and functions",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a utility function, then creates a dictionary mapping identifiers to functions or data sources. It uses 'platform' functions to gather system info and 'get_user()' for user info, storing these in a registry for pytest plugin use. No untrusted input, network activity, or code execution is present. The code is static and intended for configuration. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The use of system info functions could raise privacy considerations but is typical for environment reporting. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to potential privacy exposure but no actual security threat. The code is benign and standard for such purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet for a pytest plugin, collecting system and user info for reporting. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward, standard nature.",
