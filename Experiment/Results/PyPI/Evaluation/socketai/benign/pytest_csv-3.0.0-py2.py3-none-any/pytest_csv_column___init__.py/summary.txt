  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The import of get_user does not imply malicious intent, and the code appears to be a standard setup component. All reports' scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score (0)."
