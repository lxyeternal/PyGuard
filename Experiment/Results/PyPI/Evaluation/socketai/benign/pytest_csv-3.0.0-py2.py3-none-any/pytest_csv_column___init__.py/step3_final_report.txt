  "purpose": "The code is a set of licensing comments and import statements for internal modules, including a function get_user, likely part of a pytest plugin setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_ids, _registry, _status, _utils), including get_user",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Static import statements; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward imports, no obfuscation, no suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and static import statements from internal modules. The get_user function could access user data, but there is no evidence of its usage or malicious intent. No network, file, or external data interactions are present. The code is typical for a plugin setup and shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The import of get_user does not imply malicious intent, and the code appears to be a standard setup component. All reports' scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score (0).",
