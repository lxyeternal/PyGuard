  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of licensing comments and straightforward import statements from internal modules.\n- The only potentially concerning element is the import of `get_user` from `_utils`, which could access user data, but no evidence of malicious activity or data handling is present.\n- No network, file, or external data interactions are observed.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard setup for a pytest plugin.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; standard plugin component.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity, benign code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly more cautious, noting that `get_user` *could* access user info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — possibly overestimating the risk.\n- **Justification:** Without evidence of actual data access or malicious behavior, assigning a security risk of 0.1 seems unwarranted.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep securityRisk at 0, unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- Similar to previous, emphasizing benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and obfuscation scores:\n- All reports correctly assign 0 to malware and obfuscated, as no suspicious or obfuscated code is present.\n\n### Risk scores:\n- The only questionable score is in Report 3, where a small securityRisk of 0.1 is assigned due to `get_user`.\n- Given the limited context, this appears to be an overestimate. The import alone does not imply a security risk; unless the function is known to perform malicious actions, the risk should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — consistent and justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all, including Report 3, unless additional context indicates otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The slight elevation in securityRisk in Report 3 is unwarranted based solely on import statements.\n- I recommend setting all risk scores to 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's actual content and the absence of any suspicious behavior.",
