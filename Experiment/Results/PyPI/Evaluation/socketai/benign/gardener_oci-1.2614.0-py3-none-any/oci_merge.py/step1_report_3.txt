{
  "purpose": "This code merges OCI and Docker image manifests or indexes into a single OCI Image Index, for use in container image management.",
  "sources": "Reads image references (src_image_refs, tgt_image_ref), retrieves manifests and blobs via oci_client methods, and reads configuration data (cfg) from blobs.",
  "sinks": "Uploads combined manifest data via oci_client.put_manifest.",
  "flows": "Image references are used as sources; manifests are fetched and processed; combined manifest is created and uploaded.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic code execution. Usage of hashing for manifest digest is standard; no clear malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code processes OCI and Docker image manifests, consolidating them into an index. It uses standard hashing (SHA-256) for manifest digest calculation and JSON serialization for manifest data. No indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. It relies on the oci_client for operations, which appears to be a standard SDK usage. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate container image management function without malicious behavior. It follows standard practices for manifest handling and does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious intent.",
