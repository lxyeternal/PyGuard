{
  "purpose": "The function merges OCI or Docker image references into an OCI Image Index, handling different media types and ensuring consistency among sources.",
  "sources": "Reads image manifests via oci_client.manifest and oci_client.manifest_raw, and reads blob data via oci_client.blob.",
  "sinks": "Writes the combined image index manifest via oci_client.put_manifest.",
  "flows": "Source data (manifests and blobs) flow from oci_client to internal processing and then to oci_client.put_manifest after merging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of hashing is standard. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with the OCI registry through the oci_client interface, retrieving and combining image manifests based on media types. It handles OCI and Docker image types carefully, raising errors if incompatible types are encountered. The use of hashlib for digest calculation and JSON for manifest serialization is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No code injection, insecure data handling, or suspicious external communication is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate image management utility that safely merges image references into an OCI index. It does not exhibit malicious intent or behavior. It is a well-structured, standard implementation with no security concerns based on the provided code.",
