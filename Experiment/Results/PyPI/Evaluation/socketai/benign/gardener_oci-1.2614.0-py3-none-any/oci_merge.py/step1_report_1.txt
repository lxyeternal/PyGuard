{
  "purpose": "This code merges OCI or Docker image manifests and image indexes into a consolidated OCI Image Index.",
  "sources": "Reading image manifests via oci_client.manifest and oci_client.manifest_raw, reading blob data via oci_client.blob.",
  "sinks": "Uploading the final manifest with oci_client.put_manifest.",
  "flows": "Sources (manifests and blobs) flow into processing logic which constructs a combined manifest, then the combined manifest is uploaded.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No obfuscated code, no hidden network connections, or credential leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs data retrieval from OCI registry via oci_client, processes manifests, and constructs a new combined manifest. It uses standard library functions, hashing, and JSON serialization. There is no indication of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code. The only notable aspect is the use of hashlib.sha256 for digest computation, which is standard. No use of environment variables, insecure eval, or dynamic code execution. The code functions within expected parameters for OCI image manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for merging OCI/Docker manifests into a single index. It does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from the provided code.",
