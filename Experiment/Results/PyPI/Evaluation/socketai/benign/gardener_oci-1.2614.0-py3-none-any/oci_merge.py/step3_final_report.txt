{
  "purpose": "Merge OCI or Docker image manifests into a consolidated OCI Image Index, handling different media types and ensuring format consistency.",
  "sources": "OCI registry via oci_client (manifest fetch, raw manifest, blob, put_manifest), input image references.",
  "sinks": "Uploading the final merged manifest back to the OCI registry.",
  "flows": "Fetch manifest from source references -> validate media type -> process and extend index -> compute digest -> upload combined index.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OCI/Docker image management tasks: fetching manifests, validating media types, handling OCI and Docker formats, computing SHA-256 digest for manifests, and uploading the combined index. It uses well-established libraries and APIs without obfuscation or suspicious behavior. No external data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. Error handling is appropriate, raising exceptions on unexpected media types or format mismatches. The digest calculation via hashlib.sha256 is standard practice. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for container image management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for merging OCI/Docker image manifests into an OCI index. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior is evident. The security and malware scores are appropriately low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
