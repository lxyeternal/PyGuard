{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous OCI registry client for managing container images, including authentication, manifest retrieval, blob management, and tagging operations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, HTTP response headers, and response content streams.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to OCI registry endpoints, logging outputs, temporary files during large uploads, and response data processing.",
  "flows": "Source data (parameters, headers, response content) flows through network requests, credential handling, and response parsing to produce manifests, blobs, or status responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard use of temporary files for chunked uploads, no suspicious network activity or code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured async client for OCI registries, managing credentials via callbacks and cache, handling retries, and performing standard operations securely. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Use of temporary files for large uploads is a common pattern. Logging practices do not expose secrets. The overall behavior aligns with legitimate OCI client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure OCI registry client with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It employs standard patterns for credential management, network communication, and resource handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
