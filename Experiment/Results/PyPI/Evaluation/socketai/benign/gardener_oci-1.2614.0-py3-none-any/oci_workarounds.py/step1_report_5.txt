  "purpose": "The code manages OCI container image configurations, sanitising and updating image manifests and configuration blobs.",
  "sources": "Reads image configuration blobs (`cfg_blob`) from OCI registry via `oci_client.blob()`, and image references via `oci_client.manifest()`. It also reads manifest data from input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writes updated blobs back to OCI registry with `oci_client.put_blob()` and updates manifests with `oci_client.put_manifest()`. Constructs new image references with digest info.",
  "flows": "Fetches manifest and configuration blob → Checks and sanitises config blob if needed → Re-uploads sanitised blob → Updates and re-uploads manifest → Constructs new image reference with digest.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code appears to perform image configuration validation and sanitisation without suspicious side-effects. No obfuscation or unusual code structures detected. No external or hidden network connections are present.",
  "analysis": "The script processes container image configuration blobs and manifests, verifying their consistency and sanitising them if necessary. It reads data from OCI registry APIs, performs JSON parsing, and uploads data back. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code handles image data securely by re-uploading only after validation and sanitisation, with no indications of malicious intent. The only potential risk is if `oci_client` is malicious or compromised, but based on this code snippet alone, no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for sanitising OCI image configuration blobs and manifests, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on this analysis.",
