{
  "purpose": "The code handles OCI image manifests and configuration blobs, sanitizing and updating them within an OCI registry.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the cfg_blob parameter, image_reference, and manifest data fetched via oci_client methods.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via oci_client.put_blob and oci_client.put_manifest, which upload blobs and manifests to the OCI registry.",
  "flows": "Cfg_blob is read and processed to check and modify history layers; sanitized blobs are uploaded back; manifests are updated with new digest and uploaded.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. External library usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data validation, JSON parsing, and image manifest manipulation. It duplicates history entries to 'sanitize' configuration blobs, and updates registry data accordingly. All operations seem related to image management without suspicious or malicious intent. No network activity beyond standard registry interactions, no data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware signatures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate OCI registry client utility for sanitizing image configuration blobs and updating manifests. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain sabotage. It performs data validation and registry updates in a standard manner.",
