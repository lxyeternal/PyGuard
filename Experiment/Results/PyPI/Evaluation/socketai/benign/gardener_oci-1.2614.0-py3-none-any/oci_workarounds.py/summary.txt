  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for OCI image sanitization and registry updates. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects minor concerns about potential misuse through malformed inputs, but no malicious activity is evident. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
