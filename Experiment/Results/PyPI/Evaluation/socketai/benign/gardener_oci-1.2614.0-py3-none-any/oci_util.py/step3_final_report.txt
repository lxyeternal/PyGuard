  "purpose": "Utility functions for normalizing container image references, joining URLs, and proxying file-like streams with thread-safe duplication for processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'image_reference' strings, 'fileobj' stream objects, and internal data flows within functions.",
  "sinks": "Data read from 'fileobj' streams, passed into queues, and consumed by generator functions or thread callbacks.",
  "flows": "The 'read' method of 'fileobj' is patched to duplicate data into a queue; a thread runs a generator that yields this data; URL normalization and image reference functions process input strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity; threading and method patching are standard for stream processing.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard utility functions for string normalization and safe stream duplication using threading and queues. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is evident. The threading and method patching are controlled and well-documented, serving legitimate purposes in container image handling. The code is straightforward, with no signs of security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for legitimate container image and stream processing tasks. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate; the low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the complexity of threading but remains justified given the benign nature.",
