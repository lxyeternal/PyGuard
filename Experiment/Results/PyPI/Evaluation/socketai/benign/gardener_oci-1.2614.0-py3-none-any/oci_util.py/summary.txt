  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for legitimate container image and stream processing tasks. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate; the low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the complexity of threading but remains justified given the benign nature."
