{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and utility functions for handling legacy OCI images and Docker configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports modules: dataclasses, datetime, hashlib, random; generates timestamp and container ID.",
  "sinks": "Uses hashlib.sha256() to generate a container ID; no other sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Random integer converted to string and hashed to produce container ID; timestamp generated; data structures instantiated for Docker configs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No external data sources or network operations. Use of randomness for container ID is typical for unique identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for Docker configurations, including container settings, filesystem layers, and overall configuration. It uses Python's hashlib and random modules to generate unique identifiers and timestamps, which are standard practices. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of random and hashing for IDs, which is common in container image generation. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for creating Docker configuration objects with unique IDs and timestamps. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
