  "purpose": "Define data structures and utility functions for managing Docker OCI image configurations and filesystem layers, primarily for legacy Docker images.",
  "sources": "Random integer generation (`random.randint`), current timestamp (`datetime.datetime.now()`), and input data from the user (not explicitly shown but implied through class attributes).",
  "sinks": "Hashing function (`hashlib.sha256`) for generating container IDs, string manipulations for Image identifiers, and timestamp outputs.",
  "flows": "Random integer used to generate a container ID -> hashed via SHA256 -> assigned as Image SHA256 digest in the configuration -> timestamp generated and assigned to created field.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `random.randint()` for generating container IDs; this is not inherently malicious but can lead to non-deterministic or predictable IDs if not properly managed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed. No obfuscated code or malicious code injection detected. Usage of standard library functions is typical for configuration generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines dataclass structures for Docker configuration objects, including container configuration and filesystem layers. The `docker_cfg()` function generates a configuration with a container ID derived from a SHA256 hash of a random number, and timestamped creation time. The randomness used here is acceptable for non-security-critical identifiers, but it does not generate cryptographically secure IDs. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The use of `hashlib` and `datetime` functions appears benign. Overall, the code seems to serve a utility purpose for Docker image configuration and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration utility for Docker OCI images, generating container IDs and timestamps with no evidence of malicious behavior. Use of `random.randint()` for ID generation is not secure but not malicious. No malware or supply chain attack signals detected.",
