  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious activity. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the nature of container image operations, which involve network communication and data handling but no evident vulnerabilities or malicious payloads."
