  "purpose": "Provides data structures, enums, and utility functions for handling OCI and Docker image references and manifests, including parsing, normalization, and serialization.",
  "sources": "JSON deserialization (`json.loads()`), URL parsing (`urllib.parse`), external normalization function (`oci.util.normalise_image_reference`), and class properties accessing image reference strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects if untrusted JSON or image reference strings are maliciously crafted, especially through deserialization or normalization functions.",
  "flows": "Input JSON or strings → deserialization or parsing → normalization and property access → potential data leakage or processing of malicious data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of external normalization utility is noted but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured utility for container image references and manifests, relying on standard libraries and external utilities. No network or system modification code is present. JSON deserialization is standard but could be risky if inputs are malicious. External normalization functions are external and their security properties are unknown but assumed safe. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, considering standard data handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended for managing container image references and manifests. No malicious activity or high security risks are evident. The minor risk score reflects typical concerns with deserialization of untrusted data, which is standard in such utilities.",
