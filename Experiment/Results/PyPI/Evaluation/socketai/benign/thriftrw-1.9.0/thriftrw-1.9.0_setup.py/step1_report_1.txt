  "purpose": "Setup script for building and distributing the 'thriftrw' Python package, including Cython extension modules.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'thriftrw/__init__.py', environment variables ('THRIFTRW_PROFILE', 'THRIFTRW_COVERAGE'), filesystem for modules and files, user environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Importing Cython modules, executing setup functions, potentially executing 'cythonize' during sdist, file operations, environment variables for configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence Cython directives; reading version from file; running setup and sdist commands; importing modules and extension building.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious file operations. Use of environment variables for build configuration is standard. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup and build procedures for a Python package with optional Cython compilation. It includes checks for modules, environment-based configuration, and version extraction. No malicious logic, network connections, or privacy violations are evident. The code is well-structured and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for building and distributing a Python package with optional Cython extensions. No malicious behavior or security threats are detected.",
