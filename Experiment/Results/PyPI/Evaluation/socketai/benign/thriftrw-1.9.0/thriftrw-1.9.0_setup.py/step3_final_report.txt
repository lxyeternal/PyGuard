  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building a Python package with optional Cython extensions, managing build configurations via environment variables, and ensuring module consistency.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'thriftrw/__init__.py', reads long description from 'README.rst', and checks filesystem for '.pyx' files in 'thriftrw' directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence build directives; version info flows from source file; module verification ensures consistency.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard build practices observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks, including version extraction, environment-based build configuration, and module verification. It does not execute untrusted code or contain malicious payloads. Environment variables are used for profiling and coverage during development, which is typical. No code injection, network activity, or data leaks are detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to common practices for Python package setup with Cython support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script for a Python package with Cython extensions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is negligible.",
