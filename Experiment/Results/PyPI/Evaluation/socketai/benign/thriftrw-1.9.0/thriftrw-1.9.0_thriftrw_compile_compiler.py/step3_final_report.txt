{
  "purpose": "This code manages the compilation of Thrift IDL files into Python modules, handling includes, linking, and serialization setup.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads for include files, source code strings, and header data; data input during parsing and include processing.",
  "sinks": "File reads via open(), parsing functions, module linking, and serialization setup (Serializer/Deserializer).",
  "flows": "Source code and include paths lead to filesystem reads, then into parsing, module creation, and linking processes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Filesystem access is validated and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module management tasks typical of a Thrift compiler component. It reads files from the filesystem with validation, processes includes, links modules, and sets up serialization functions. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The filesystem interactions are properly validated, and the code structure is clear and well-organized.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Thrift compiler component with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The low risk score (around 0.2) is justified by controlled filesystem access. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0.",
