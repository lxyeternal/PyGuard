{
  "purpose": "The code provides licensing and module metadata, and imports functions 'load' and 'install' from a local loader module.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments and imports from local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks that process untrusted input or data outputs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists; the code only imports functions and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; code is straightforward and contains standard licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The script contains licensing information, versioning, and imports of functions from a local module. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or credential storage present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module entry point. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It primarily sets metadata and imports functions for package use.",
