{
  "purpose": "This code is the header and import section of a Python package, likely related to loading and installing modules or data.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local 'loader' module, and module metadata (__version__ and __all__). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no untrusted data handling or system calls are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a licensing comment, import statements, and module metadata definitions. It references local module functions but does not invoke them. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling is observed. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign module initialization snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is typical boilerplate code for a Python package.",
