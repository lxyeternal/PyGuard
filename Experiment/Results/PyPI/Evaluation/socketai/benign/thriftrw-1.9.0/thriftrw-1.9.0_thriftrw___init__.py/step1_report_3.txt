  "purpose": "The code provides licensing and import statements for a Python package, including versioning and module exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own license comments, import statements, and module attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output functions that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; standard licensing comments and import statements without suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of licensing comments, import statements, and module attribute definitions. No input handling, data processing, or network interactions are present. The import statements reference local modules, and no sensitive information or untrusted data sources are involved. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a standard package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only contains license comments, version info, and imports. The code poses no security threat.",
