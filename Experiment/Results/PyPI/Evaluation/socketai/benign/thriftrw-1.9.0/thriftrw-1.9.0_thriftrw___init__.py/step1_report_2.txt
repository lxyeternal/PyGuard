{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package providing functions for loading and installing components, likely related to a larger library or framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module (.loader) and the version declaration (__version__). No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or environment variable modification detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly imports functions and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, mostly metadata and imports. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package initializer, importing functions from a local module and defining metadata. No external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior. The licensing comments are standard open-source licensing statements. No malware or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup file with no malicious intent. It serves to provide access to 'load' and 'install' functions from the local loader module, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
