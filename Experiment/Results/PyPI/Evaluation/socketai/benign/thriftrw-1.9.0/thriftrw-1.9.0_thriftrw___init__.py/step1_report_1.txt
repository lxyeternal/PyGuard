{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a package initialization module for a Python library, providing importable functions 'load' and 'install'. It primarily sets up module metadata and imports functions from a local loader module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module's own source files and the local '.loader' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions from a local module and assigns metadata, with no dynamic execution or data flow from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains no obfuscated elements, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical package initializer with copyright, license information, and module setup. It imports functions from a local module named 'loader' and sets version info. No user input, environment variables, or external data are processed. No code execution, network communication, or suspicious behavior is detected. The code adheres to standard Python packaging conventions and contains no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package initialization script with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It simply imports functions and sets metadata for a Python package.",
