  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a typical Python package initialization module, containing licensing comments, version info, and import statements from a local 'loader' module.\n- There are no signs of dynamic behavior, user input processing, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- All reports agree on its benign nature, with a confidence level of 1.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not include any executable code beyond imports and metadata.\n- No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign package initializer.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, safe Python module setup.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- No further action needed.",
