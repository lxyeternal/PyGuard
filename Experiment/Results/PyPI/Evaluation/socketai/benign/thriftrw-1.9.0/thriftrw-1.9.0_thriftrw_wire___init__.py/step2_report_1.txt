  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes module setup, imports, and documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or sensitive data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None; static class references, documentation, import statements.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on module organization, imports, and documentation.\n- No external data, no dynamic code, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Emphasizes the code as a typical library module, mainly import statements and documentation.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — aligned with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar pattern: import setup, documentation, no external data or code execution.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also a straightforward module defining types and message classes.\n- No external data, no runtime logic, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. All reports describe static, import-based module setup with no runtime or external data handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are set to zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with my assessment. The code is standard library setup code, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
