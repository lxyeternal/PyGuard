{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports various data type classes and message handling classes for a Thrift-related library, focusing on type definitions and module structure.",
  "sources": "Module imports (__future__, relative imports of internal modules), no external data inputs or user inputs present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network operations, file writes, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code mainly declares class imports and module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code is a standard module structure for a library.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of import statements, class definitions, and an __all__ export list. It includes licensing comments and documentation strings. There are no network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution. All classes and modules appear to be part of a standard data type and message handling library, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a typical library code for defining data types and message classes, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains no external data sources, sinks, or flow paths that could lead to security issues.",
