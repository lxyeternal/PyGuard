  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling errors related to the Thrift protocol.\n- It includes classes for general errors (`ThriftError`), parser errors (`ThriftParserError`), compiler errors (`ThriftCompilerError`), protocol errors (`ThriftProtocolError`), end-of-input errors (`EndOfInputError`), and unknown exceptions (`UnknownExceptionError`).\n- The `UnknownExceptionError` class has a custom `__str__` method that formats its message and associated `thrift_response`.\n- The code uses `from __future__ import` statements for compatibility.\n- No external data input/output, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- Exception classes are standard and serve typical error handling purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears correct, well-structured, and free of bugs or security flaws.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  The code contains no malicious payloads, external communications, or obfuscation. The `__str__` method in `UnknownExceptionError` is standard for exception classes.  \n  **Score: 0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  The code is clear, with no obfuscation or code hiding techniques.  \n  **Score: 0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The code is purely for error handling and does not perform any data processing, network activity, or external input/output.  \n  **Score: 0** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The `__str__` method in `UnknownExceptionError` outputs exception details, but this is standard practice and not malicious.\n- No signs of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The use of `super()` and exception inheritance is conventional.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports' conclusions are consistent with the code. The code is a typical, benign set of exception class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a standard, secure implementation of custom exception classes for a Thrift Python library. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The assigned scores are appropriate, and I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe and does not pose any security concerns.",
