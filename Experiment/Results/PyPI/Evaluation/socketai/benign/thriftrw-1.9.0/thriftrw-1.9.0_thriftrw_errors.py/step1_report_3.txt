{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Thrift RPC framework, including error types for parsing, compilation, protocol handling, and unknown exceptions.",
  "sources": "Import statements (from __future__ import ...), class definitions, exception initializations, string representations.",
  "sinks": "Exception message formatting in __str__ and __repr__ methods.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated and converted to strings for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as network activity, code execution, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code is standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes with constructors and string representation methods. It imports future features for compatibility but does not include any input/output operations, network calls, or data processing. No malicious behavior or security issues are apparent. The purpose appears to be straightforward error handling within a library.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves a typical purpose in error management for the Thrift framework.",
