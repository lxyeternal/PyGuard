  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Thrift-related errors used in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements; class definitions; exception initializations and string representations.",
  "sinks": "String formatting in __str__ and __repr__ methods; exception raising; inheritance chain.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exceptions -> string conversion (__str__ / __repr__) -> output or logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of exception classes is standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from base exception classes. The __init__, __str__, and __repr__ methods are standard, with no indications of malicious payloads or suspicious data handling. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or environment variable usage. The code is clean, conventional, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of custom exception class definitions for a Thrift-related Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is likely safe for use.",
