  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any malicious or security concerns are present.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for handling Thrift protocol errors.\n- No external data input/output, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The exception classes are standard, with a minor customization in __str__ for UnknownExceptionError.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, assigning maximum confidence and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n**Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n- The code is syntactically correct and aligns with typical Python exception class patterns.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n- The use of `super()` in `__init__` and `__str__` methods is standard.\n- The import of future features is for compatibility and is safe.\n\n**Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:**\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or external communications.\n- The custom __str__ method in `UnknownExceptionError` only formats strings; it does not perform any suspicious activity.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- No external data handling, network calls, or code execution.\n- The exception classes are purely for error handling and do not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Score Evaluation:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0              | No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Standard exception classes, no suspicious behavior. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Clear, straightforward error handling code. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0              | No external data, obfuscation, or malicious activity. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Standard exception definitions, safe. |\n\nAll scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only notable feature is the customized string representation in `UnknownExceptionError`, which is typical and harmless.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose for error handling in a Thrift Python library.**  \nNo changes to the scores are necessary.",
