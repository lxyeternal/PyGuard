{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a Thrift-related Python library, mainly for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; code defines classes and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class definitions do not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; standard class inheritance and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python class definitions for custom exceptions related to Thrift protocols. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded credentials, nor external data handling. The only notable feature is the customized __str__ and __repr__ methods in UnknownExceptionError, which are typical for exception classes and do not indicate malicious intent. The imports and class structures are straightforward and serve typical error handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a Thrift Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
