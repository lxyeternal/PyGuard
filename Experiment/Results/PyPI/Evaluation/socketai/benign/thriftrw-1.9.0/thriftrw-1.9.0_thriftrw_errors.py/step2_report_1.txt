  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Content:**\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to Thrift protocol errors.\n   - It uses standard Python exception inheritance.\n   - The only notable customization is in `UnknownExceptionError`, which overrides `__str__` and `__repr__` to format exception details.\n   - The import statement uses `__future__` features for compatibility, which is common and benign.\n   - No external data input/output, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - The code is purely for error handling.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - The `__str__` method in `UnknownExceptionError` only formats strings; nothing indicates malicious intent.\n   - The exception classes are standard practice.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Anomalies:**\n   - No logical flaws or anomalies are present.\n   - The exception hierarchy and methods are straightforward.\n   - The code is clean, conventional, and does not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, with some at 0. Given the code's nature, a risk score of 0 is justified because it's standard exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n   - **Confidence:** 1.0, as the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n5. **Potential for Leaking Sensitive Data:**\n   - The only exception class with a custom string method is `UnknownExceptionError`, which could potentially leak internal exception details if it included untrusted data. However, it only formats the message and `thrift_response`, which appears to be an object or data structure, not raw untrusted input.\n   - Since the code does not process or log untrusted data directly, no leakage risk is evident.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions for a Thrift protocol handling library.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if being very conservative, but 0 is justified)\n- **Justification:** The code is purely for defining exception classes, with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive; I agree with their assessments.",
