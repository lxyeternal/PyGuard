  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling errors related to the Thrift protocol, including parsing, compilation, protocol errors, and unknown exceptions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, exception instantiations, string formatting in __str__ method of UnknownExceptionError.",
  "sinks": "Exception message outputs via __str__ and __repr__, but only formatting strings; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects, calling __str__ or __repr__ for error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a Thrift library. It uses conventional inheritance, no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The __str__ method in UnknownExceptionError only formats messages and does not process untrusted input. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is clean, straightforward, and serves its error handling purpose effectively.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
