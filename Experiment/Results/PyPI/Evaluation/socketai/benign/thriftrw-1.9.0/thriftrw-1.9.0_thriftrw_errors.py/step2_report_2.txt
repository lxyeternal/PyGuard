  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for handling Thrift protocol errors.\n   - It imports future features for compatibility and defines exception classes with standard constructors and string representations.\n   - No dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n   - The `UnknownExceptionError` class customizes its `__str__` method, but this is a common pattern for detailed exception messages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard, with no malicious patterns.\n   - They emphasize the absence of suspicious behavior, external communications, or obfuscation.\n   - The analysis aligns well with the code's content; no significant logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The high confidence levels (mostly 1) are justified because the code is simple, standard, and free of suspicious elements.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5. The code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious intent.\n   - Therefore, the overall risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious activity or payload.\n   \n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they accurately describe the code as standard exception handling classes.\n   \n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, benign implementation of custom exception classes for a Thrift Python library. The reports correctly identify the lack of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat.",
