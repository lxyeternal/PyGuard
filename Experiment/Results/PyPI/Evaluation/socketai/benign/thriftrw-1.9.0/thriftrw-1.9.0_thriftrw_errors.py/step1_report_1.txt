{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Thrift protocol handling and errors within a Python application or library.",
  "sources": "Import statement for absolute_import, unicode_literals, print_function; class definitions; exception initializations and string representations.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling and string conversion methods, which could potentially log or display exception details.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated and converted to strings, which could lead to leaking internal error information if untrusted data is included (though not in this case).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. Exception classes are standard and do not perform external communications, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for Thrift protocol errors, including classes for parsing, compilation, protocol errors, and a special 'unknown exception' with a custom __str__ method. The import statement uses future annotations for compatibility. No external data input/output, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The exception class 'UnknownExceptionError' has a __str__ method that formats and outputs exception info, but nothing appears malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a Thrift-related Python module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or security risks.",
