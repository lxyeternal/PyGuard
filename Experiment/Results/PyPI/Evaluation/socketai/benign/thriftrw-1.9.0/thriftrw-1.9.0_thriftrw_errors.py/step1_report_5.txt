  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in Thrift-related operations.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exception class initializations and internal code execution.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines exception classes and a custom __str__ method; it does not perform any data processing or I/O operations. There are no external inputs, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. It follows standard Python exception class patterns without any obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a Thrift library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
