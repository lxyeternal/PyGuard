  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the open source Python dependency based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, command-line arguments, data processing functions, and external library calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, and data output points where untrusted data could cause leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, args) to processing functions, then to output or network sinks, potentially via unsafe data handling or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code segments detected; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies. Malware scores are consistently 0, reflecting no malicious intent. Security risk scores are 0.2, slightly conservative but acceptable given the benign descriptions. Confidence levels range from 0.7 to 0.9, justified by the thoroughness of reviews and lack of suspicious patterns. The code is described as straightforward data processing with typical input/output handling, no external malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation. The assessments are consistent across reports, and no anomalies or suspicious signals are evident. Given the lack of actual code snippets, conclusions are based solely on report summaries, which are cautious and reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are justified and consistent with the descriptions. No further action or score adjustments are necessary based on current information.",
