{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, used for installing and configuring the package 'harness-featureflags'.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata files (README.md, HISTORY.rst), defines requirements, and calls setup() with package info.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; no sinks that handle untrusted input or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static files into variables (readme, history), then into setup() parameters; no untrusted data flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; all parts are standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading documentation files, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. No evidence of code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling. The code does not import or execute external code dynamically, nor does it contain obfuscated segments. All dependencies are declared explicitly and safely. The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python SDK package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It safely prepares the package for distribution.",
