{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, specifying dependencies, metadata, and package details.",
  "sources": "File reads for README.md and HISTORY.rst; package requirement lists; package discovery via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points for untrusted data; no code execution or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reading files to assemble long description; passing dependency lists to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading documentation files, defining requirements, and configuring package metadata. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No external data input is processed at runtime, nor are there any network connections, code injections, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
