  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'harness-featureflags', used to install dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads content from 'README.md' and 'HISTORY.rst' files; imports modules from 'sys' and 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setup()' to process package installation parameters, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads README and HISTORY files -> constructs dependency lists -> passes data into 'setup()' -> package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup routines: reading documentation files, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. It imports necessary modules safely, reads files to include descriptions, and specifies dependencies explicitly. The 'setup()' function is used with conventional arguments for packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. All operations are standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal, benign package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
