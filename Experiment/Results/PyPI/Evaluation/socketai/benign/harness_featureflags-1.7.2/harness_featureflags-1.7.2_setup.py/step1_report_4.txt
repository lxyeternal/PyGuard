  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python SDK related to feature flags.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'README.md' and 'HISTORY.rst', and external package requirements listed in 'requirements' and related variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or outputs that could leak data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Reading files (sources) for long description, and passing dependencies to setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external communications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: reading documentation files, defining dependencies, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No user input, no environment variable manipulations, no code injections, or external network activities. The dependencies are well-defined with version constraints. The structure follows common packaging conventions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
