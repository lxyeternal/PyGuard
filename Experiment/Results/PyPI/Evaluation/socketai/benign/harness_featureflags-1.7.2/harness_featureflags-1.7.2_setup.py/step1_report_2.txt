{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and configure a Python package for distribution, specifying dependencies, metadata, and package inclusion.",
  "sources": "File reads for 'README.md' and 'HISTORY.rst', and static package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reading files to variables; static setup configuration flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools. It reads long descriptions from markdown and rst files, defines dependencies, and specifies package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, or external data flows that could be exploited. The code follows typical Python packaging patterns and does not contain suspicious behaviors or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely configures package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
