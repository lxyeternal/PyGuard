  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a library, reading static documentation files, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static files ('README.md', 'HISTORY.rst') for long description; dependency declarations in code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external inputs, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static data used for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup code with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional 'setup.py' script for packaging a Python project. It reads static documentation files, specifies dependencies explicitly, and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with project metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, external data handling, or network communications. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The dependency list is standard and safe. The only minor point is a security risk score of 0.1 in one report, which is unwarranted given the static and benign nature of the code; it should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign Python package setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature; the only correction needed is to set the security risk score to 0 across all reports for consistency.",
