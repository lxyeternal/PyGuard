  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard telemetry collection implementation with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. The network communication is typical for such SDKs. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the network activity but does not indicate malicious behavior."
