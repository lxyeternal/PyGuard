  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the Feature Flag Server SDK project.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and featureflags modules; reads environment path; reads version info from featureflags module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> sets sys.path -> reads featureflags.__version__ -> proceeds with configuration setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic present. Standard configuration code; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up documentation build configurations for Sphinx, including paths, extensions, themes, and project info. It imports 'featureflags' and accesses its __version__, but this is standard and expected for versioning info. No untrusted input handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing are observed. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets up the documentation environment without performing any suspicious actions.",
