  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and featureflags modules; reads environment and project version.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; primarily static configuration.",
  "flows": "Imports featureflags to obtain version info; sets configuration parameters for documentation generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The import of featureflags could potentially be used to access version info, but this is standard practice in documentation scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static configuration for Sphinx documentation generation. It manipulates sys.path and imports the featureflags module to get version information. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration file used for setting up documentation with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
