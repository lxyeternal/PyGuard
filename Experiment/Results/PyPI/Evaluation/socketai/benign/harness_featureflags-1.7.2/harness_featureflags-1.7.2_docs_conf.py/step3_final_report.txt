  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation generation, including module imports and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Importing 'os', 'sys', and 'featureflags' modules; accessing 'featureflags.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from 'featureflags' module; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard configuration code with straightforward module imports and variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx conf.py file, importing standard modules and a local 'featureflags' module solely to retrieve version info. It modifies sys.path to include the parent directory for local module access. There are no network operations, user inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns. The code is static, purpose-specific, and free of suspicious elements. The import of 'featureflags' for version info is common practice and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The overall structure and content are consistent with benign documentation configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All indicators confirm it is safe, with no security risks or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and accurate.",
