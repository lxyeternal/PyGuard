  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation using Sphinx, setting up paths, extensions, themes, and output options.",
  "sources": "Imports 'os', 'sys', and 'featureflags' module; sys.path modification; reading version info from 'featureflags.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data output, network connections, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads version information from 'featureflags' and uses it for documentation metadata. No external data flows or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs. Standard configuration code; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports standard modules and a local 'featureflags' package to configure documentation generation. It modifies 'sys.path' to include a parent directory, likely to import the package. Version information is extracted from 'featureflags' to set project version data. All other configurations relate to Sphinx documentation options. No network activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious code or obfuscated elements are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for a documentation build setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file for building project documentation. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected. It is safe and purposeful for its intended use.",
