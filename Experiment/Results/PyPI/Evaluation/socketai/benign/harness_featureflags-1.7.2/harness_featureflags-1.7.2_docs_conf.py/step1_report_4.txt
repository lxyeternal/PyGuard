  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the Feature Flag Server SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os, sys, and featureflags module; sys.path modification; usage of featureflags.__version__.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data or external output is handled in a manner that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(\"..\")) -> import featureflags -> use featureflags.__version__ for version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior. The script performs typical documentation configuration tasks with standard modules. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file generated by sphinx-quickstart. It modifies sys.path to include the parent directory for module discovery, then imports a module named featureflags solely to retrieve version information. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. All operations are read-only configuration steps without any apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical configuration file for generating documentation with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It simply sets up paths, extensions, and output options for Sphinx, and safely imports the featureflags module to obtain version info.",
