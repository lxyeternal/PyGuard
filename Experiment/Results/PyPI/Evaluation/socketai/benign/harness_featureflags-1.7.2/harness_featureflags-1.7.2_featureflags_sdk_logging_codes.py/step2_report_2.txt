  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides utility functions for logging SDK statuses and errors, with no external data reads.\n- **Sinks:** Logs only status/error messages, no sensitive data or untrusted inputs.\n- **Flows:** Structured message formatting; no data flow issues.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, benign logging utility. No malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (minimal, mostly about log data exposure risk).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with focus on SDK events, errors, and warnings.\n- **Sinks:** Logs untrusted data like 'event_json', 'reason', 'error', which could contain sensitive info but are used only for logging.\n- **Flows:** Data from parameters into logs; standard practice.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The functions are wrappers for logging, with potential minor concern about logging untrusted data, but this is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Logging for SDK events, with input parameters that could be untrusted.\n- **Sinks:** Data like 'event_json', 'reason', 'error' are logged directly.\n- **Flows:** Straightforward data flow into logs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard logging utility, no malicious activity. Slight concern about logging untrusted data but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, for SDK event logging.\n- **Sinks:** Logging potentially sensitive info.\n- **Flows:** Data from parameters into logs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, standard logging functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for SDK statuses and errors.\n- **Sinks:** Possible logging of sensitive info if untrusted data is passed.\n- **Flows:** Data flows into logs.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK logging utility, no malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely for logging SDK events and errors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, primarily related to potential logging of untrusted data, which is standard in logging utilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes needed; the code is benign.\n- Given the consistent pattern, I would assign a **malware score of 0**, **obfuscated score of 0**, and a **risk score of around 0.1** to reflect minimal potential data leakage concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (due to logging untrusted data, but not malicious)\n\nThis analysis confirms the code is a standard, safe logging utility with no malicious or obfuscated components.",
