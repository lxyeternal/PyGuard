  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured logging utility for SDK events and errors. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The potential security concern is logging untrusted data, which is standard in logging utilities but should be managed appropriately outside this module. The overall assessment indicates no malicious intent or security threat."
