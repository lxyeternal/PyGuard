{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for logging various SDK-related events and errors, including informational, warning, and error messages based on SDK state, connection, and fetch operations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as error codes, error messages, reasons, durations, event JSON objects, intervals, attempts, and error descriptions.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can potentially be logged via the log.warning or log.info calls, especially when including error messages, event data, or retry details, which could expose sensitive information if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs (error codes, messages, event JSON, reasons, attempts) into formatted log messages via get_sdk_code_message, then into logging functions, potentially exposing data in logs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a logging utility; there are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated or malicious behavior is evident. No dynamic code execution or hidden data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of mappings between numeric SDK codes and their descriptive messages. It then provides wrapper functions to log specific SDK states or errors with context. Inputs are incorporated directly into log messages, which is typical for logging behavior. The structure and formatting suggest straightforward logging logic without hidden or malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, code injection points, or data exfiltration mechanisms are apparent. All data flows are safe as they are limited to formatted log strings; however, care should be taken to avoid logging sensitive info if passed into functions like 'info_stream_event_received' or 'warn_*' functions with untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility for SDK events and errors, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It serves to record SDK operational states and errors, with no indicators of malware or security risks. Proper handling of sensitive data in logs should be enforced externally. Overall, it appears safe and intentionally designed for diagnostics.",
