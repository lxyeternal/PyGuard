{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) for a Python package, serving informational purposes during packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string assignments for __author__, __email__, and __version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static metadata without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. No executable code, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present. The code is standard for Python package setup files and contains no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and transparency support these conclusions, and no further analysis or action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall risk is negligible. The code is safe for use in any environment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
