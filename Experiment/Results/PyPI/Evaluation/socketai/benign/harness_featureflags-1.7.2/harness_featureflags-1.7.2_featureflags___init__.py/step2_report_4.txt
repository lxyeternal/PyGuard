  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, consisting solely of module-level metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__). There are no executable statements, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code. This aligns with the actual code snippet provided.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \nNo report detects any suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code. All mention that the code is benign, standard, and only serves as package metadata.\n\n3. **Analysis of Security Risks and Scores**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious activity or code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's straightforward nature—no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which makes sense because the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Inconsistencies**  \n- The reports are very consistent and accurate.  \n- Since the code is just metadata, there are no grounds for higher scores or concern.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**  \n- The reports do not mention any external dependencies or potential for malicious payloads elsewhere in the package.  \n- Given only this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk indicators. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided analysis, given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious elements.\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo changes needed. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet.",
