  "anomalies": "Lack of code execution, data handling, or dynamic elements; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variable assignments (__author__, __email__, __version__). There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears to be a standard package-level comment or docstring with metadata attributes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple metadata declaration with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It is standard in Python packages for identifying authors and versioning. No security concerns are identified.",
