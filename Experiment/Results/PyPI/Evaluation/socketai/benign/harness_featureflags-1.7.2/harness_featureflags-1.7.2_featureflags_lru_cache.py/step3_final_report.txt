  "purpose": "Implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using OrderedDict to manage cache entries with eviction policy.",
  "sources": "Initial cache data from args, cache get/set/remove methods, logging during eviction.",
  "sinks": "Logging warnings about evicted keys; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from cache insertions/updates to eviction logging; no external untrusted data processed beyond internal cache operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard cache logic, no obfuscation, no hidden backdoors or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an LRU cache with standard Python practices. It uses OrderedDict to track access order, evicts least recently used items when exceeding size, and logs evictions. No external data is processed insecurely, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns are present. The only minor concern is logging potentially untrusted keys, which is a common practice and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard LRU cache implementation with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to logging practices, which are typical and not malicious. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the overall security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the logging activity but not representing a security threat.",
