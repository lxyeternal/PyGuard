  "purpose": "Implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache mechanism for storing key-value pairs with a fixed size limit.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters for cache content, method arguments for get/set/remove operations, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Cache operations (get, set, delete) which modify or retrieve data from the internal OrderedDict.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (keys, values, initial cache state) through method calls to modify or access the internal cache.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated logic detected. Use of logging is standard for cache eviction notifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an LRU cache with standard methods for cache manipulation. It uses an OrderedDict to maintain insertion order and implements eviction policy when exceeding size. The cache operations are straightforward and do not involve untrusted data sources or network interactions. The only notable activity is logging cache evictions, which is standard. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard cache implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical cache operations without any suspicious behavior. No security concerns are evident based on the provided code.",
