  "purpose": "Implementing an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache mechanism for caching data with a size limit.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; cache keys and values are stored internally.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; cache operations involve internal data structures only.",
  "flows": "N/A - no external data flow to untrusted sources or sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of logging for cache eviction; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an LRU cache using an OrderedDict, managing cache size and eviction policy. It uses standard Python practices without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No external input is processed insecurely, and no data leaks or malicious behaviors are evident. The cache uses a 'log.warning' call during eviction, but this is typical for cache management and not suspicious. Overall, the implementation appears standard and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward LRU cache implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs cache operations internally without processing untrusted data or executing suspicious actions.",
