{
  "purpose": "A streaming client connecting via SSE to process feature flag and segment messages, updating local cache accordingly.",
  "sources": "Network connection to stream URL, message data received from SSEClient",
  "sinks": "Processing functions that update cache or fetch configurations, no external data leaks or malicious actions observed",
  "flows": "Network input from SSEClient -> message parsing -> conditional processing -> cache update or fetch",
  "anomalies": "Typo in attribute '_environemnt_id' (should be '_environment_id'), no hardcoded secrets, standard use of randomness for backoff",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK component for feature flag management, establishing SSE connections, handling messages, and updating cache. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Credentials are passed via parameters, not hardcoded. The retry logic with exponential backoff and randomness is typical. The typo in '_environemnt_id' is a minor bug but not security-related. No suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured streaming client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, and malware and obfuscation scores are 0. The code appears safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
