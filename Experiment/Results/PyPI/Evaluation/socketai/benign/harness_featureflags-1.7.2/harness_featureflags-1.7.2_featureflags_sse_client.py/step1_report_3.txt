  "purpose": "Implement an SSE (Server Sent Events) client for streaming real-time events from a server.",
  "sources": "HTTP response stream from requests.get; request headers for connection setup; parsing of SSE data from stream.",
  "sinks": "Parsing of event data from server stream; updating internal state such as last_id and retry values.",
  "flows": "Response stream data -> decoder -> buffer -> event parsing -> Event object -> update last_id/retry if specified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code found. Uses standard libraries and request module. No obfuscated code or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of an SSE client using Python's requests library. It connects to an event stream URL, streams data, decodes and buffers incoming data, and parses SSE messages into Event objects. The logic for reconnecting on failure, updating retry intervals, and handling message IDs appears standard. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The only data involved is streaming event data, and there are no dangerous system calls or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, legitimate implementation of an SSE client without malicious intent. It does not contain malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The use of requests and standard parsing is typical for such functionality.",
