{
  "purpose": "Implementing a Server-Sent Events (SSE) client to connect to a streaming server and process event messages.",
  "sources": "HTTP request to the specified URL in the __init__ and _connect methods, reading raw response data in iter_content, parsing lines in Event.parse.",
  "sinks": "Parsing and processing of event data in the Event.parse method, where event data can be stored in self.data, but no direct sink of untrusted data to system or network is present.",
  "flows": "HTTP response data flows from requests.get to iter_content(), then accumulates in buf, parsed into Event objects in __next__, and data is stored in Event instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected. The code performs standard SSE client functions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious API calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard SSE client with connection handling, streaming, and parsing logic. It utilizes the requests library for HTTP requests and codecs for decoding response streams. Event parsing uses regex matching, and the code handles reconnects upon stream termination. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, network connections to unknown domains, or code injection, are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an SSE client without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SSE client implementation with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It safely handles streaming event data and manages reconnections. No security risks or malicious activities are detected.",
