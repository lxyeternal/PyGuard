{
  "purpose": "Implement a Server Sent Events (SSE) client for receiving real-time streaming data from a server.",
  "sources": "HTTP request to the specified URL via requests or session; reading response stream and raw data from response object",
  "sinks": "Processing of incoming event data; potential logging functions",
  "flows": "HTTP request → response stream → buffering and decoding → event parsing → returning Event objects",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data; no suspicious network connections; no unusual or obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution or command injection; standard use of requests library and regex; no evident backdoors or hidden functionality",
  "analysis": "The code defines an SSE client that connects to a server endpoint and processes incoming event streams. It uses the requests library to make HTTP GET requests with specified headers and streams response content. Incoming data is buffered, decoded incrementally, and split into events based on a regex pattern matching end-of-field delimiters. Events are parsed into structured Event objects with attributes such as data, event type, id, and retry interval. The Event class handles parsing lines according to the SSE spec and assembling complete messages. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The code primarily focuses on network communication, data streaming, and event parsing, with no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of an SSE client with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical streaming and parsing functions without any suspicious or malicious behaviors. Overall, the code is safe, with low malware and security risk scores.",
