{
  "purpose": "Standard implementation of a Python Server-Sent Events (SSE) client for streaming real-time events from a server.",
  "sources": "HTTP response stream via requests.get, reading raw data chunks, parsing SSE lines with regex.",
  "sinks": "Parsing incoming data into Event objects; no untrusted data is written to system files or network beyond the SSE stream itself.",
  "flows": "HTTP response raw data → buffer accumulation → regex parsing → Event object creation → handling of 'retry' and 'id' updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured SSE client that manages network streaming, reconnections, and event parsing according to the SSE spec. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. Error handling and reconnection logic are typical for such clients. No data leaks, code injection, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an SSE client with no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
