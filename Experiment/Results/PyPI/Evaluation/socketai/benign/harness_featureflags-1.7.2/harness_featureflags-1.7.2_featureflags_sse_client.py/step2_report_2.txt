  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and determine if the scoring aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard SSE client implementation.\n- It uses well-known libraries (`requests`, `codecs`, `re`) with no signs of obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded credentials, malicious network calls, or code injection points are present.\n- The parsing logic follows the SSE spec, with proper handling of event fields.\n- Error handling and reconnection logic are typical for such clients.\n- No suspicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Implementing a standard SSE client.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, safe, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is a legitimate SSE client with no malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** SSE client for processing event streams.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, standard usage, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The security risk score is appropriate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** SSE client for streaming real-time events.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** SSE client for consuming real-time event streams.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The scoring matches the code's behavior. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** SSE client for real-time event streams.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Security risk score:** Given the code's nature—network communication, data parsing, reconnection logic—these are typical and do not introduce significant security risks. The scores of 0.1 to 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a standard, safe implementation of an SSE client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
