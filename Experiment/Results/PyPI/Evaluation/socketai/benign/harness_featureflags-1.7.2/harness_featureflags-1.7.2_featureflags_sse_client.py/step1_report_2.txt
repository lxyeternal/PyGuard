  "purpose": "Implement an SSE (Server-Sent Events) client to connect to and process event streams from a server.",
  "sources": "HTTP response stream, request headers, request parameters, and server-sent event data.",
  "sinks": "Parsing of event data, updating of last_id and retry variables, potentially logging warnings.",
  "flows": "HTTP request → server response stream → chunk reading → decoding and buffering → event parsing → updating state variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. Usage of requests library is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. Logging warnings for malformed lines are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an HTTP streaming connection to a specified URL with appropriate headers to receive server-sent events. It reads chunks from the response stream, decodes them, buffers partial data, and splits complete events based on the end_of_field regex. The Event class parses individual SSE messages, extracting fields such as data, event, id, and retry. The code updates internal state like last_id and retry based on incoming messages. No user input is directly processed, nor are there data leaks or code injections. No external or secret data is accessed or transmitted. The only notable activity is standard streaming and parsing of server events with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical SSE client with standard libraries and practices. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for use in legitimate applications.",
