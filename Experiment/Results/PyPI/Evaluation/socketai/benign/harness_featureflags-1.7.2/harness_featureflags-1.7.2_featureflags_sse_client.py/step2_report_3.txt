  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a standard SSE client implementation using Python's requests library, with proper handling of streaming, parsing, and reconnection logic. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears legitimate and aligns with typical SSE client patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code:\n   - Uses standard libraries and practices.\n   - Properly handles network streams and parsing.\n   - Does not contain hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.\n   - Does not perform any malicious activities or obfuscation.\n\n   No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - malware: 0\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - securityRisk: around 0.1–0.2\n   - confidence: 0.9\n\n   These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero, reflecting no malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk is low, considering the code's functionality and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a high risk score. The code is a straightforward SSE client with no malicious intent, no data exfiltration, no code injection, and no suspicious network activity. Therefore, risk scores above 0.5 are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's structure, libraries used, and behavior. They do not speculate about hidden functionalities or vulnerabilities that are not present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct, no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct, code is clear and standard)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1–0.2 (appropriate, low risk, standard implementation)\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\nConsidering all the above, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a legitimate, standard SSE client with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0.1 (to reflect minimal inherent risk due to network communication, but overall very safe)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is safe, with no security risks or malicious behaviors detected.",
