  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; however, Report 4's use of obfuscation and dynamic execution suggests moderate suspicion. Increasing its malware score from 0.3 to 0.5 aligns better with the identified risks. Other reports are appropriately scored. Overall security posture remains low risk, with a need for cautious review of suspicious constructs."
