  "sources": "Assignment of version string and version tuple",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data handling",
  "flows": "None; static assignment of version data",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating auto-generated code; no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns version information to variables, indicating it is auto-generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no data input, external communication, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior are present. The comments suggest it should not be manually changed, consistent with standard version management practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, auto-generated version info for a Python package. It poses no security risk or malware threat.",
