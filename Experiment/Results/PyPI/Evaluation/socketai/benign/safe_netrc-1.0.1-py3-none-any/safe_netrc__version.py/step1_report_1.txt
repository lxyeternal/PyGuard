{
  "purpose": "To define and expose the version information of the package using setuptools_scm",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string assignment (__version__ and version variables)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is standard versioning metadata",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets version variables using hardcoded strings, indicating the package version. It notes that the file is generated by setuptools_scm, a common version control tool. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious code structures. The comments indicate this file should not be altered or tracked, which is typical for auto-generated metadata files. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, auto-generated version metadata file with no malicious intent or security risks.",
