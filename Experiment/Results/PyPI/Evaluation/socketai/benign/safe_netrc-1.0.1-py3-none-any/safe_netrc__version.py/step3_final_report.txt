{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information variables for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples; no external inputs or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communication points.",
  "flows": "N/A - static assignments with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version metadata snippet with no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, auto-generated, and free of malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. No obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present. The code does not perform any operations beyond static variable assignments, and there are no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified. All reports are accurate and require no modifications.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
