  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward, auto-generated version metadata file.\n   - The code only assigns static version strings and tuples to variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`).\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external data handling.\n   - The comments indicate that the file is generated by setuptools_scm, a standard version control tool.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is found.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data leaks, code execution, or contain suspicious patterns.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**\n   - The code is purely static, with no external dependencies or dynamic behavior.\n   - The reports correctly conclude that there are no security risks or malicious behaviors.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n   - Obfuscation is 0, which is correct given the straightforward code.\n   - Confidence is 1, as the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a benign, auto-generated version metadata snippet with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a simple, static assignment of version info, generated by setuptools_scm.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
