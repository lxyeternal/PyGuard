{
  "purpose": "Define package version information using setuptools_scm conventions",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings assigned to variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; code comments indicate autogenerated content and version info",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, setting version variables with static strings. No input, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior. The comments suggest it is an autogenerated file created by setuptools_scm, which is common in Python packaging. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, harmless autogenerated version declaration for a Python package. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior.",
