  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, auto-generated version metadata file.\n- The code assigns static version strings and tuples to variables.\n- There are no external inputs, no dynamic code, no network activity, and no suspicious code structures.\n- The comments indicate the file is generated by setuptools_scm, a standard tool for version management in Python projects.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected in any report.\n\n**Review of the Code and Reports:**\n- The code snippet provided matches the descriptions in all reports.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no security risks or malware.\n\n**Scores and Reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified based on the code's simplicity.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version metadata file with no security concerns.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The scoring is appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
