  "purpose": "Define static version information variables for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, conditional import for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of version variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, boilerplate, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated version info snippet, with static version strings and type hinting constructs. It does not perform any runtime logic, data processing, or external communication. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The code's purpose is purely to hold version metadata, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
