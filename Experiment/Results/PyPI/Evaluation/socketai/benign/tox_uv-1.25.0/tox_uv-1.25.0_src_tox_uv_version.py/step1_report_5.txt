{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples, and conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks related to untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version information variables, including version string and tuple, with static values. It includes a conditional import block for type checking purposes, which is standard practice. The version data is hardcoded but not malicious, serving typical package versioning purposes. There are no dynamic evaluations, network operations, or sensitive data handling. Overall, this code appears to be boilerplate generated code for version management, with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to set version variables for a Python package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
