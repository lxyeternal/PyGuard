{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage versioning data.",
  "sources": "The version string assigned to '__version__' and 'version', and the 'VERSION_TUPLE' data.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining conditional type checking imports to assigning static version information to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no dynamic execution or secret handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up versioning variables based on setuptools_scm. It uses conditional type checking imports which are standard for type hints, and assigns fixed version values. There are no external inputs, user data, or potentially dangerous operations. The code is purely informational and generated for version control purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated version definition snippet with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation present.",
