  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, without any functional or operational behavior beyond version management.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string (__version__ and version variables), conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING",
  "sinks": "No external data input or untrusted data output points",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; version data is statically assigned",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward version info assignment with standard type checking pattern",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information for a Python package, including a version string and tuple. It uses a typical pattern for conditional type checking with 'TYPE_CHECKING'. The version is hardcoded as '1.25.0' and stored in various variables. There are no inputs, external data flows, or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard for version management generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version info assignment with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply sets version variables for the package and uses conditional imports for type checking, which is common practice. No malware or security risks are present.",
