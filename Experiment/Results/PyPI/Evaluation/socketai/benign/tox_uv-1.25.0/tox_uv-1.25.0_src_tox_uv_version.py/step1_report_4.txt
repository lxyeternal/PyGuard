{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and does not perform any runtime logic beyond variable assignments.",
  "sources": "Constant assignment of version strings and tuples; conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only static data definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard versioning pattern with no suspicious constructs or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines version variables for the package, with a conditional import based on type checking. It uses static assignment and a typical pattern for version handling. There are no external inputs, no data flow, and no dynamic or malicious code segments. The code is straightforward and appears to be auto-generated metadata. No security issues or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated version metadata snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
