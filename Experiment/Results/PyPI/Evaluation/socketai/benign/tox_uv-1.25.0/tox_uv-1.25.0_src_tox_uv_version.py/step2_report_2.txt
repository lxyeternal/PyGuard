  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a standard auto-generated version info snippet, setting variables like `__version__`, `version`, and `VERSION_TUPLE`.\n- It uses a conditional `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block for type hints, which is common.\n- The version is hardcoded as `'1.25.0'`, with the tuple `(1, 25, 0)`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**1. Presence of Reported Issues:**\n- The reports state that the code only defines static version variables, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- No external data input, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Verdict:** The reports are accurate; the code does not contain malicious or security-compromising elements.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports uniformly describe the code as benign and standard. They do not misrepresent the code's function.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident; all reports correctly interpret the code as boilerplate version info.\n\n**Verdict:** No flaws or mistakes in the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis and Justifications:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious actions, dynamic code execution, or contain obfuscated/malicious payloads.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code is static, with no external dependencies or inputs.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, auto-generated code.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies:**\n- None observed; scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports assume that because the code is static and straightforward, it cannot be malicious. This is correct.\n- No hidden behaviors or vulnerabilities are implied or evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The overall analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Estimate:\nGiven the code and the reports, I concur that:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is purely boilerplate version metadata, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No issues, anomalies, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The assigned scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n**Final verdict:** The code is safe, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
