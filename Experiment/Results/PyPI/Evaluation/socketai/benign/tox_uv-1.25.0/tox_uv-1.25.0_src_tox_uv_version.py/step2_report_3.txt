  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims and assess the scores.\n\n**Code Content Summary:**\n- Defines version variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) with static, hardcoded values.\n- Uses a conditional `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block to import typing annotations, which is standard for type hints.\n- No external input, dynamic code, or data processing.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious behavior, no network activity, no data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is straightforward and matches the description. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; the code only assigns static version info.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is clear and generated boilerplate.\n- **Security risk:** None; no external inputs or sensitive data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \n- All reports consistently describe the code as benign, standard version management boilerplate generated by setuptools_scm.\n- The reasoning is sound, and no suspicious behavior is claimed or observed.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Scores for each issue:**\n- **malware:** 0 (correct, no malicious code)\n- **obfuscated:** 0 (correct, code is clear)\n- **securityRisk:** 0 (correct, no security issues)\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across all reports.  \n- Given the code's nature, no higher scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no challenge to their reasoning is necessary.\n- The code is standard boilerplate for version info, with no malicious or risky elements.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, auto-generated version info snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reported assessments and scores are accurate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
