  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, without any malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string and version tuple variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or data leaks",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from sources to sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hidden behavior observed; the code is straightforward version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version variables using static assignments, with conditional type hints that do not affect runtime behavior. No external input is read, and no data is transmitted or processed insecurely. The structure is simple and typical for generated version info files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purpose is to define version information. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified.",
