{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a minimal module defining the package version information for a Python project, possibly intended for GitHub Actions integration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version information from an internal module '.version'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data can lead to data leaks or execution effects; the code does not process external inputs.",
  "flows": "The source (importing version from '.version') is assigned to __version__, which is then included in __all__ for module export.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely simple and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from an internal module and exposes it via __all__, which is a common pattern for versioning in Python packages. There are no dynamic or suspicious behaviors, no external inputs, and no code execution beyond standard import. The code is straightforward and minimal, indicating no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
