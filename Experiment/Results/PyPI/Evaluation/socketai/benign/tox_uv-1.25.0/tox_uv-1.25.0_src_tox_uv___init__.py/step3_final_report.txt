{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal version declaration module, likely used for version management in a Python project or CI/CD pipeline such as GitHub Actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.version' to import the 'version' string.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code only exposes a static version string.",
  "flows": "The version string is imported from '.version' and assigned to '__version__', then exposed via '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module that imports a version string and exposes it. It contains no dynamic behavior, external inputs, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose and behavior are clear, and the security assessment aligns with its minimal nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version management module with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
