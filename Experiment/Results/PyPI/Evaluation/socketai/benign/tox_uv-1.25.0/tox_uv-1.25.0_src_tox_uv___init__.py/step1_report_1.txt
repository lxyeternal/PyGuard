{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module versioning and exposure of the version variable for a package.",
  "sources": "Reading the module's own __version__ from an imported version file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The module imports version info and exposes it via __all__, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module and exposes it in the module's namespace. The use of __future__ import suggests compatibility considerations. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data processing, no suspicious functions, and no code that could lead to malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for version management. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected.",
