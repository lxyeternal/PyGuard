  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is extremely minimal, consisting solely of importing a version string from a local module and exposing it via `__all__`.\n- No inputs from untrusted sources, no data processing, no network calls, no dynamic code execution.\n- The code comments suggest integration with GitHub Actions, but this is purely descriptive.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, and no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Confirmation of issues:**\n- The code as provided does **not** contain any malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious constructs.\n- It is a standard pattern for version management in Python packages.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and typical.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident; the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The `risk` score is also 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Risk justification:**\n- Since the code is purely for version exposure with no external input, no network activity, and no dynamic behavior, the risk is negligible.\n- No reason to assign a higher risk score.\n\n**Malware and obfuscated scores:**\n- Both are correctly set to 0.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No unverified assumptions are made.\n\n**Score consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriate for this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration module.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No external data handling or dynamic execution.\n- The code is safe and typical for its purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The scores are appropriate, and there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
