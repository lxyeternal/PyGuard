  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports a version string and exposes it via __all__ for package distribution or identification.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .version import version as __version__",
  "sinks": "None present; no data handling or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports and exports a version string",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard import and export statements with no obfuscation or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module and makes it publicly available. It includes a comment indicating GitHub Actions integration, likely for CI/CD purposes. No user input, network communication, or data processing is present. No suspicious or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for version management, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
