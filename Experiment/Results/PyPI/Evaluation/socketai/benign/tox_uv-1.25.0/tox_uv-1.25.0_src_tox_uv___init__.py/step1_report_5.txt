{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module documentation string and module-level variables defining the version of the package.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement from .version import version as __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "The version import flows directly to the __version__ variable, which is then exposed in __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a relative module, likely for package versioning purposes. It contains a docstring indicating GitHub Actions integration, but no code that performs any data processing, network operations, or untrusted input handling. The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or version management file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on defining package versioning information with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
