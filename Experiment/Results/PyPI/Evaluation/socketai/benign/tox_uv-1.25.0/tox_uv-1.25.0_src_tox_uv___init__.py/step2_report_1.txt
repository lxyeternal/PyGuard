  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, straightforward module that imports a version string from a local `.version` module and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- No untrusted data sources, data sinks, or data flows involving external inputs are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code is typical for package version management and seems benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious behavior:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is benign, with malware scores of 0. They correctly identify that the code only imports and exposes a version string without any malicious logic.\n\n2. **Code correctness and logic:**  \n   The code is minimal and appears correct. The version string is imported from a local module, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores and reasoning:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n   - **Malware score:** All are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security risk score:** All are 0, justified by the lack of external inputs, data processing, or network activity.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**  \n   - The reports assume that the `.version` module is safe and not malicious. Since the code only imports from it, the security depends on that module's integrity. However, given the context, this is standard practice.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or exploits are made, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Any anomalies or suspicious claims?**  \n   No. The reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or assessments.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe version declaration module with no security concerns.",
