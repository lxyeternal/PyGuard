{
  "purpose": "This code appears to serve as a version information module, likely for a Python package, providing a version string.",
  "sources": "The code imports the version string from a local module '.version'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or external output.",
  "flows": "The version information is imported and then exposed via the __all__ list, which is a standard pattern for defining module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a relative module, indicating modular organization. It then declares __all__ to specify that __version__ is publicly accessible. The code contains no input handling, no external network calls, and no suspicious logic. The comment about 'GitHub Actions integration' is merely descriptive and does not influence the code's behavior. Overall, the code functions as a typical version info module with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for Python packages.",
