  "purpose": "Collects environment information such as Python implementation, version info, and system architecture, then outputs it as JSON.",

  "flows": "Sources (environment data) passed to json.dumps(), then printed via print()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data collection with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and gathers environment details without user input, network activity, or obfuscation. It serializes this info into JSON and prints it. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is purely informational, and all signals indicate benign behavior. The reports correctly identify the code as a simple environment info collector with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and justified based on the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment information reporter with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
