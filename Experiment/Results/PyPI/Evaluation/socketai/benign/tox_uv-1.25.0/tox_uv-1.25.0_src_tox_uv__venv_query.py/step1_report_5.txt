  "purpose": "The code gathers and outputs information about the Python environment, including implementation, version, and architecture.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sys.version_info, sys.version, and platform.python_implementation() functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.dumps to output the gathered environment data as a JSON string.",
  "flows": "Sources (sys, platform) -> Data collection -> json.dumps (output)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code performs straightforward environment info reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and prints a JSON string containing Python implementation details, version info, and architecture. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The functions used are standard Python library calls for environment introspection. The only minor note is the use of print with a noqa comment, but that is unrelated to malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple environment info reporter with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
