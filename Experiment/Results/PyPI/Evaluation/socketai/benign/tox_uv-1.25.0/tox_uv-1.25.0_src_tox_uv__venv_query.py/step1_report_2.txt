  "purpose": "The code gathers and outputs environment and platform information such as Python implementation, version, and architecture.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys.version, python_implementation()",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() outputs data; no untrusted data sources or sinks are involved",
  "flows": "Data from sys and platform functions flows into json.dumps() for output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed; code only collects environment info",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and platform modules, retrieves Python implementation details, version info, and system architecture, then outputs this data as JSON. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. The use of print with noqa comment indicates awareness of linting but no malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely collects and prints environment details for informational purposes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
