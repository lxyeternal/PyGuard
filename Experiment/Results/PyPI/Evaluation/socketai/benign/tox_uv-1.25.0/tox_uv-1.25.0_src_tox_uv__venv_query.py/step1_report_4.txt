  "purpose": "The code collects environment information such as Python implementation, version, and system architecture, then outputs it as a JSON string.",
  "sources": "Reads environment data via platform.python_implementation(), sys.version_info, sys.version, and sys.maxsize.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data using print(), which writes to stdout.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from environment functions and then passed directly into json.dumps(), ultimately printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code simply retrieves system info and prints it. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses platform and sys to gather environment info. It outputs this info as JSON via print(). There are no dynamic code executions, no data leaks, no external network connections, and no suspicious obfuscation. It appears to be a benign environment info script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment information collector with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It only outputs system environment details.",
