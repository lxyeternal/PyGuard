  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and retrieves Python environment details. It then serializes this information into JSON format and prints it. No external inputs or untrusted data are used. The use of 'print' is benign in this context. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purpose appears to be environment reporting. No malicious behavior or security concerns identified.",
