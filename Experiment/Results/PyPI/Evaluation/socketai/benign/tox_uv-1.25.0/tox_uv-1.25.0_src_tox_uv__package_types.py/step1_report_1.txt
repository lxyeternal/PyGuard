  "purpose": "Define package classes for uv build and install processes, including editable and wheel variants.",
  "sources": "Import statements and class attribute definitions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; class instantiation does not involve external inputs or network operations",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; uses type hints and conditional imports appropriately",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of classes inheriting from a base package class, intended for building and installing packages with uv. No external data input, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The imports are standard, with type hints and conditional import for typing checks. The class attributes and methods are straightforward, serving as data containers with no dynamic execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of package classes for uv, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
