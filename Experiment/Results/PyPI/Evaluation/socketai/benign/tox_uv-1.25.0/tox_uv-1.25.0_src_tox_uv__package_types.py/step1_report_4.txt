  "purpose": "Define classes for uv package management, including built, wheel, and editable wheel variants.",
  "sources": "Import statements and class initializations. No external data inputs; class attributes are static or derived from parameters.",
  "sinks": "None apparent. No data handling, network operations, or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures for package handling, inheriting from an existing class. It imports typing modules and a package class from a tox module. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing occurs. The classes serve as data containers with no malicious or risky behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard class definitions for package management, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation focused on organizing package types.",
