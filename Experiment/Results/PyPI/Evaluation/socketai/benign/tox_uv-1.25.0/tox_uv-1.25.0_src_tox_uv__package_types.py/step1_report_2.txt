  "purpose": "Define classes for packages managed by 'uv' build system, including built and editable wheel packages.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up class structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines class hierarchies for package types, extending from an imported base class. It uses type hints, conditional imports for type checking, and assigns class constants. There are no input/output operations, external data handling, or security-sensitive functions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard class definitions for packaging without any malicious intent or security issues. No anomalies or malicious signals detected.",
