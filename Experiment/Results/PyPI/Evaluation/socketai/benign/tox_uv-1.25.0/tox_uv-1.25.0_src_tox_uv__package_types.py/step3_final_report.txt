  "purpose": "Define package classes for the uv build system, enabling installation and editable installation modes.",
  "sources": "Path input during class instantiation, provided externally when creating class instances.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Path input flows into class constructors, but no data flows to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three classes inheriting from a base package class, setting class attributes and initializing with a path and extras. It uses conditional imports for type checking, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely structural, intended for package management within a build system, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. All signals indicate no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
