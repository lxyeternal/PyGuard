  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided scores, and assess the validity of their conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The report states no suspicious behaviors, malware, or anomalies are detected. Given the summary, it appears the code is benign.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (consistent)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.1 (low, aligns with no detected issues)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n  - confidence: 0.9 (high confidence)\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The report's conclusion seems justified. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The report notes dynamic eval/exec usage but considers it not necessarily malicious. This is a common pattern that warrants caution but isn't inherently malicious.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (no explicit malware detected)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.3 (moderate risk due to dynamic features)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation mentioned)  \n  - confidence: 0.75\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The use of eval/exec increases potential risk, but without evidence of malicious payloads, the malware score remains at 0.  \n  The securityRisk score of 0.3 seems appropriate given the dynamic features, but perhaps slightly conservative.  \n  The overall scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The report indicates limited information, no suspicious activity, and no malicious signs.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (low, consistent with benign assessment)  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - confidence: 0.6\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The lack of explicit code makes the assessment cautious but reasonable. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The report highlights obfuscation, dynamic code execution, encoded strings, and suspicion of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0.4 (moderate, given obfuscation and dynamic code)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.6 (higher due to obfuscation and potential malicious techniques)  \n  - obfuscated: 0.8 (high, matching the description)  \n  - confidence: 0.7\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The high obfuscation and dynamic execution are valid concerns. The malware score of 0.4 reflects suspicion but not confirmed malicious activity.  \n  The risk score of 0.6 seems justified, considering the obfuscation and potential for malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The report notes insecure patterns, dynamic execution, and suspicious domain connections, but no confirmed malicious payloads.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0.3 (moderate, due to insecure patterns)  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - confidence: 0.7\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The absence of confirmed malware justifies a malware score of 0. but the insecure patterns warrant some concern, reflected in the securityRisk score.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring consistency:\n\n- The malware scores are generally aligned with the level of suspicion.  \n- Obfuscation scores are only high in report 4, matching the description.  \n- Security risk scores are proportional to the presence of obfuscation, dynamic code, or insecure patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nGiven the overall reports, most do not show confirmed malicious behavior. Only report 4 indicates obfuscation and dynamic code, which raises suspicion but not confirmed malware. I would assign a **malware score around 0.2** overall, considering the potential but unconfirmed malicious traits.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nOnly report 4 explicitly mentions obfuscation with a high score (0.8). Others are clear. I suggest an overall obfuscated score of **0.2** to reflect that only one report indicates obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nMost reports indicate low to moderate risk, with report 4 being the most concerning. An overall risk score around **0.3** seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | **0.2**         |\n| Obfuscated     | **0.2**         |\n| Security Risk  | **0.3**         |\n\nThese estimates balance the evidence across all reports, considering the presence of obfuscation and dynamic code as potential vectors but without confirmed malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the reports are generally consistent, the most concerning is report 4, which warrants closer inspection before deployment. The overall scores should reflect the cautious stance due to obfuscation and dynamic features, but not overstate the malware threat without concrete evidence.",
