  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code review indicates no confirmed malicious activity in the provided reports, but report 4's obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques warrant a higher suspicion level. Adjusting report 4's malware score to 0.5 and risk to 0.65 improves alignment with observed behaviors. Other reports are appropriately scored. Overall, the dependency appears low risk but warrants cautious handling due to obfuscation techniques present in certain reports."
