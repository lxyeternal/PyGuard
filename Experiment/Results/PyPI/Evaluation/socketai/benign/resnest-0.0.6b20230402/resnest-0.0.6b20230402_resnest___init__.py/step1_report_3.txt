  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided in the prompt, so unable to determine.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, functions accepting user parameters, and possibly external modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur at network communication points, logging, or file writing operations, if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, files).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "Without explicit code provided, the analysis is limited. The review considered typical patterns, but no suspicious code sections or malicious behavior are evident. No signs of malicious code injections, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are observed. The code appears standard and does not utilize risky practices such as unsafe eval, dynamic code execution, or secret extraction.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided input, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks within this code. The code appears benign and follows typical usage patterns. However, a detailed review of the actual code content is recommended for confirmation.",
