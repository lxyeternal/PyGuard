  "purpose": "Define loss functions and criteria for training models, including label smoothing and mixup data augmentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from torch and resnest libraries; configuration parameters from 'cfg'; input tensors 'x' and 'target' in forward methods.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to malicious activity; data flows are typical for machine learning training processes.",
  "flows": "Data from input tensors flows through softmax, loss calculations, and returns a scalar loss value.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard loss functions with label smoothing and multi-label smoothing, along with a mixup wrapper for data augmentation. No malicious logic or external network activity is present. The code appears to be legitimate for machine learning purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of loss functions used in training neural networks. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities within this module.",
