  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to __version__. It contains no input handling, external data reads, or untrusted data flows. The string appears to be a standard version format with a 'b' indicating a beta release and a date suffix. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This file contains only a version identifier with no malicious behavior or security issues. It is a typical version declaration used in Python packages.",
