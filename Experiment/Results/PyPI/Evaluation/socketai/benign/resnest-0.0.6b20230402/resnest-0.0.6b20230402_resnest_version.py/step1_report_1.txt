  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the resnest package.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no unusual constructs, no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single line assigning a version string to __version__. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no use of environment variables, or any other suspicious activity. The version string appears to follow a naming convention indicating a pre-release or beta build with a date suffix.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, static version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be standard practice for package versioning.",
