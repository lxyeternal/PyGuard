  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no dynamic behaviors, no input handling, no external data flows, no code execution, and no obfuscation.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and follows standard versioning practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The assessments correctly note the absence of suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n   - The confidence scores are 1.0, which seems justified due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary for these scores.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely a static version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior, the scores of 0 for malware and security risk are correct.\n   - The obfuscated score is also correctly 0, as there is no obfuscation present.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities; the reports correctly avoid speculation.\n   - The assumption that version strings are benign is valid here.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No inconsistencies or overestimations are observed.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify that this is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or adjustment is needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scores. The code is safe and standard; no malicious or obfuscated behavior exists.",
