  "purpose": "Assigns the version string for the package, indicating its release or development stage.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '__version__ = '0.0.6b20230402''",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output points",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple static assignment with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, straightforward assignment of a version string to the __version__ variable. It contains no dynamic behavior, input handling, external data fetching, or code execution. The version string includes a 'b' (beta indicator) and a date suffix, which are standard in versioning. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
