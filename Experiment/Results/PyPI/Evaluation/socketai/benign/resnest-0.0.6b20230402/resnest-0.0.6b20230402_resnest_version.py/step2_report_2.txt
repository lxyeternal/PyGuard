  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - The code is static, with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external data sources.\n   - The version string includes a 'b' (beta indicator) and a date suffix, which is standard in versioning schemes.\n   - No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Behavior**:\n   - There is no evidence of malware, malicious code, or any behavior that could compromise security.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or execute dynamic code.\n   - The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet.\n\n3. **Error or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they all recognize the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The scoring appears appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated**: 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n   - **Malware**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n   - **Security Risk**: 0 (no security concern)\n   - The scores are reasonable and align with the analysis.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since this is a minimal, static version declaration, there is no reason to assign any higher risk scores.\n   - The confidence level of 1.0 is justified, as the analysis is straightforward and consistent.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports are accurate. The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security issues. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is harmless.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Note**: Always remain vigilant for more complex or dynamic code snippets, but this particular case is straightforward.",
