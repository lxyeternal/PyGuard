  "purpose": "Utility functions for downloading, unzipping, directory creation, and file integrity checks, likely for managing datasets or resources in a project.",
  "sources": "Reading URL inputs, reading local file paths, checking file existence, reading file content for hash verification.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to files, creating directories.",
  "flows": "URL input -> download function -> request response -> file write -> optional hash check.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. Uses standard libraries and common patterns. No unusual or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for unzipping files, downloading files with progress indication, verifying SHA-1 hashes, and creating directories. The download function includes URL validation, progress tracking via tqdm, and hash verification to ensure integrity. No external or untrusted data is processed in a way that suggests malicious intent. The code operates within typical data management scope, with no indications of malicious behavior such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logging is minimal and standard. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate utility module with no malicious functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility for file handling and downloading, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for resource management without attempting to exfiltrate data or execute hidden actions.",
