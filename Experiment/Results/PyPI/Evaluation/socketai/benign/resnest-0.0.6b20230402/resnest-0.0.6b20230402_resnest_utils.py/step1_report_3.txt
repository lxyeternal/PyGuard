  "purpose": "Utility functions for file management, including unzipping, downloading, directory creation, and SHA-1 checksum verification.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from URLs (in download), reading files for checksum (check_sha1), reading zip files (unzip).",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to disk, extracting zip files to disk, creating directories.",
  "flows": "Download URL -> Save file -> Optional checksum verification -> Unzip file -> Save files/directories.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. Use of tqdm for progress display is standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utilities for file handling. 'download' fetches files over HTTP, optionally verifying SHA-1 hash, which mitigates tampering risks. 'unzip' extracts archive contents, 'check_sha1' verifies data integrity, and 'mkdir' safely creates directories. No suspicious patterns, no external code execution, no hidden data transmission, or backdoors are evident. The code is typical for managing datasets or resources in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility module for file operations with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs legitimate tasks such as downloading, extracting, and verifying files securely. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are detected.",
