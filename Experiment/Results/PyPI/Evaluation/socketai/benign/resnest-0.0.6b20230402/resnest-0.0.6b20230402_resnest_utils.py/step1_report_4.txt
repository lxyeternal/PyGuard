{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for downloading, unzipping, and managing files, with a focus on verifying file integrity via SHA1 hashes.",
  "sources": "Input URL for download function; file paths for checksum verification and extraction.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to local files, extracting zip files to directories.",
  "flows": "URL input -> download() -> saves file locally -> optional sha1 check -> unzip() extracts contents.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code structures; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file handling and download operations. The download function fetches files from specified URLs with optional overwrite and SHA1 verification, which is typical for ensuring file integrity. The unzip function extracts zip files into a specified directory. No code appears to send data over the network beyond the download request, nor does it contain hidden or malicious behavior. No suspicious or backdoor code, no dynamic execution, nor code that could be used maliciously is present. The functions are typical utility implementations. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This module consists of standard, benign file download and extraction utilities with integrity checks. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is straightforward and does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malware.",
