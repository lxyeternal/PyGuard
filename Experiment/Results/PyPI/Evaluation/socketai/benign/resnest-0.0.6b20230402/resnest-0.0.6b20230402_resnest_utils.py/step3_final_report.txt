  "purpose": "Utility functions for downloading, unzipping, SHA1 verification, and directory creation, intended for file management tasks.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from URLs (requests.get), reading files for SHA1 checksum, extracting zip files, checking directory existence.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded files to disk, extracting files to directories, verifying file hashes.",
  "flows": "Input URL or file path → download or open file → verify hash or extract contents → save files/directories.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file handling operations with proper error handling and security checks like SHA1 verification. It uses common libraries appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The network requests are straightforward, and the functions are typical utility routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs legitimate file management tasks without malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk.",
