{
  "purpose": "The code defines a registry for models named 'RESNEST_MODELS' and provides a function to retrieve models by name from this registry.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'model_name' input parameter passed to the get_model() function.",
  "sinks": "The get_model() function may use untrusted input ('model_name') to access the registry, which could potentially lead to unintended behavior if the registry contains malicious or incorrect entries.",
  "flows": "Input 'model_name' -> RESNEST_MODELS_REGISTRY.get(model_name) -> returns model or None.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Usage of external registry object is standard for plugin/model registration systems. No obfuscation or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Registry class from an external library, initializes a registry for models, and provides a function to retrieve models by name. It relies on the external registry to manage models. The input parameter is used directly to access the registry, which is typical in plugin or model management systems. No signs of malicious code, data leakage, or backdoors are present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for registry-based model management.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard registry pattern for models with a retrieval function. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The use of untrusted input to retrieve registry entries is typical in such patterns, assuming the registry contents are managed securely.",
