  "purpose": "Retrieve a model from the RESNEST_MODELS registry using a model name.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'model_name' used in RESNEST_MODELS_REGISTRY.get()",
  "sinks": "The registry's get() method, which retrieves an entry based on 'model_name'",
  "flows": "Input 'model_name' flows directly into the registry's get() method to retrieve a model",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward registry access; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Registry class, creates a registry object, and defines a function to retrieve models by name. The core operation is a direct lookup with unvalidated input, which is typical in plugin or registry patterns. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The main security concern is the use of untrusted input to access registry entries, which could be exploited if malicious entries are present. The code itself is minimal and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk score should reflect the potential for external registry content issues, but the code remains benign. The malware score is zero, as no malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated score is zero, given the clarity of the code. The overall security risk is low, around 0.15, considering the external trust assumptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard registry pattern with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary concern is external management of registry entries and input validation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk (~0.15). No modifications are necessary.",
