  "purpose": "Define and retrieve models from a registry for ResNest models.",
  "sources": "RESNEST_MODELS_REGISTRY.get(model_name) - retrieves a model by name from the registry.",
  "sinks": "RESNEST_MODELS_REGISTRY.get(model_name) - potentially executing code based on untrusted input if the registry's get method is misused.",
  "flows": "Input 'model_name' flows into the get method of the registry to retrieve a model.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated code detected. The registry usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Registry class, creates a registry for models named 'RESNEST_MODELS', and provides a function to retrieve models by name. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The registry's get method relies on 'model_name', which if untrusted, could cause unintended behavior, but this is standard in registry pattern implementations. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard registry pattern for models with no malicious behavior. It appears secure, assuming the registry and models are used correctly and the input is validated elsewhere.",
