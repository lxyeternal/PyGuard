  "purpose": "Registering and retrieving models in a registry system for a machine learning framework",
  "sources": "The code reads input data when calling get_model, which takes a model_name parameter",
  "sinks": "The get_model function retrieves data from the registry, potentially leading to dynamic code execution if the registry contains malicious entries",
  "flows": "Input model_name -> RESNEST_MODELS_REGISTRY.get() -> returns model or data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; the registry mechanism could be exploited if malicious entries are added",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Registry class from a third-party library, creates a registry instance for models, and defines a function to retrieve models by name from this registry. The core functionality is registry lookup, which is standard in plugin systems. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. Potential security concern exists if the registry contains malicious or untrusted model entries that could be executed or used maliciously, but this depends on external input and management rather than the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward registry pattern implementation without malicious intent. Its security depends on the trustworthiness of the registry entries and how the registry is managed outside this code snippet.",
