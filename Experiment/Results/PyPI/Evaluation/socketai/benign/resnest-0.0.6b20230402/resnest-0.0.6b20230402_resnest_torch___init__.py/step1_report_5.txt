  "purpose": "Import all components from the local 'models' module, likely for use within a larger application or package.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present in this line.",
  "flows": "N/A - This line does not involve data flow from sources to sinks; it only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a wildcard import ('*') can be considered unusual or discouraged, but it does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple import statement, importing all objects from a relative 'models' module. There are no evident security issues, malicious actions, or obfuscated code. The use of wildcard import may hinder code clarity and static analysis but is not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior. The only concern is the use of a wildcard import, which is a best practice violation but not a security threat.",
