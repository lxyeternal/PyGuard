  "purpose": "Import all definitions from a local models module, likely for use within the current package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package directory.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported models could be a sink if they handle untrusted data or interact with sensitive operations, but the code itself does not show such behavior.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are demonstrated in this snippet; it only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports all contents from a local module named 'models'. It is a common pattern in Python projects to load models or components. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or unusual constructs. Since it is a single line import statement, it does not contain any logic or behavior that could be malicious. Without additional context or code, there are no indicators of security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security issues. It does not constitute malware or security risks by itself.",
