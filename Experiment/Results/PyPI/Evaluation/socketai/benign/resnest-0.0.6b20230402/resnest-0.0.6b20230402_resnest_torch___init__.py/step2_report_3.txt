  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: `from .models import *`.\n- The purpose across reports is to import all components from a local 'models' module.\n- No report indicates any actual malicious activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is a straightforward relative import, common in Python packages.\n- Use of `import *` is discouraged for clarity but is not inherently malicious or risky.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code is just an import statement, with no signs of malicious activity or security flaws.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The only potential flaw is the use of `import *`, which can lead to namespace pollution and maintenance issues, but this is a style concern, not a security issue.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a benign import statement.\n- No report makes unsupported assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting minimal concern; one report assigns 0. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- No evidence of malicious activity or security risk justifies higher scores.\n- The only concern is the use of `import *`, which is a style issue, not a security threat.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- The high confidence levels (0.8-1.0) are justified given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, style-related concern, not security-related)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign, a standard import statement.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the current scoring accurately reflects the low risk.",
