  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the original code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .models import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all components from a local 'models' module.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the import as straightforward, with no data processing or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just a common pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The low security risk score is appropriate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the import as standard, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning; wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The risk score could be zero since there's no evident security concern, but a small 0.1 is acceptable to reflect best practice concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the pattern as common, with no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** No supply chain threat.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The risk score is appropriately minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusion; wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) due to the wildcard import, which is a code quality concern but not a security threat. This is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious activity or data flow.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** None identified. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - Malware: All zero, appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: All zero, appropriate.\n  - Security Risk: Mostly very low (0.1), with one at 0.2 due to the wildcard import. This aligns with best practices and common understanding.\n- **Potential Overestimation:** No report suggests any actual malicious intent, so risk scores are not inflated.\n- **Potential Underestimation:** No, the scores are reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minor concern due to wildcard import, but not a security threat.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged for clarity and maintainability but does not pose a security risk in this context.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment. The overall assessment indicates no supply chain security threat from this import statement.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Maintain a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) due to coding style concerns, not security issues.",
