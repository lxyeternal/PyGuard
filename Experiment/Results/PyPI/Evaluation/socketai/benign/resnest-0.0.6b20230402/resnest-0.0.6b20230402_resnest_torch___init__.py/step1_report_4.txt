  "purpose": "The code imports all components from a local 'models' module, likely for use within a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.models'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported components elsewhere in the package; no direct sinks in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imported objects may be used downstream in the package, but no explicit data flow is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure what is being imported, but it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a standard import from a relative module, which is common in package development. It provides no direct malicious or suspicious behavior by itself. The 'import *' pattern can sometimes be risky for clarity but does not indicate malicious intent here. There are no anomalies or malicious indicators present in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It is standard for Python modules and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
