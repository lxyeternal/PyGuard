  "purpose": "Import all components from a local module named 'models'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module 'models'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the import itself does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow identified; this is a simple import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .models import *' can be considered poor practice due to potential namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious. No other anomalies present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import from a local module named 'models'. There is no input handling, data processing, or network activity. The use of wildcard import could be suspicious in large codebases but does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are apparent from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import from a local module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a common pattern, albeit with less recommended practice of wildcard imports.",
