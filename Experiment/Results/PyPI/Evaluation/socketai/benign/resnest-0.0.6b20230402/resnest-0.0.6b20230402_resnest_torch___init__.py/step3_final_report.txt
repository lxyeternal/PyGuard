{
  "purpose": "The code performs a relative import of all components from the local 'models' module, likely for use within a package or module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or data sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a static import with no data flow or execution path beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but it is not malicious or obfuscated. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage is evident. The wildcard import ('import *') is a style concern but does not introduce security risks. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The risk score is low (0.1 to 0.2), justified by the poor practice of using 'import *', which can lead to maintenance issues but not security vulnerabilities. The confidence score is high (around 0.9), as the analysis is based on the code's content and common Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and standard within Python packages. The scores assigned are appropriate: zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score reflecting style concerns rather than security threats. No further action is necessary.",
