{
  "purpose": "This script is used to set up and package the 'resnest' Python library, including versioning and requirements specification.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (RELEASE), filesystem files ('resnest/version.py', 'README.md'), and package metadata from variables and functions.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'resnest/version.py', reading 'README.md', and invoking setup() for package installation.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> Version string construction -> Creating 'version.py' -> setup() call with package info and requirements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The version string dynamically appends a date based on environment variable 'RELEASE'. The code prints build info but no malicious side effects are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes version info, potentially appending a date if the 'RELEASE' environment variable is not set. It writes version info to a file within the package directory and invokes setuptools.setup() to prepare the package for distribution. The process involves standard package setup procedures without suspicious or malicious code. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code is present. The code's purpose aligns with typical package setup and version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It only performs build and packaging tasks typical for Python projects.",
