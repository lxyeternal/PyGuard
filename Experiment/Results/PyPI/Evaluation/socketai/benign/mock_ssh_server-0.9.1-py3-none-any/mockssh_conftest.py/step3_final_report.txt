  "purpose": "Setup pytest fixtures for testing SSH server interactions using mockssh, managing temporary directories and loading a sample user key.",
  "sources": "Reading sample-user-key file, fixture definitions, tempfile and shutil for directory management",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into system or external systems; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Sample user key loaded from file -> used in server fixture; fixtures yield SSH server and client objects",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets beyond test key path, or unusual patterns; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test setup for SSH server testing, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution based on untrusted input. It manages temporary directories securely, loads a sample key for testing, and configures logging. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports correctly assess the code as safe. The minor overestimation of security risk in one report (0.1) can be set to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is a standard, secure test fixture setup.",
