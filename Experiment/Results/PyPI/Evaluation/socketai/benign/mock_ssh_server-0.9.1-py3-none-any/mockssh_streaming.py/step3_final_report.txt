  "purpose": "Manage SSH channel and subprocess stream transfer, facilitating data relay between network channels and local processes.",
  "sources": "channel.recv, process.stdin.readline, process.stdout, process.stderr, channel.sendall, channel.sendall_stderr",
  "sinks": "channel.sendall, channel.sendall_stderr, process.read, process.stdout.readline, process.stderr.readline",
  "flows": "recv() -> write() -> flush() (from SSH to process), process.readline() -> write() (from process to SSH), data transfer loops between these streams",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected; straightforward stream management",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries to implement asynchronous stream transfer between SSH channels and subprocesses. It registers streams with selectors, transfers data read from network to process input, and relays process output back to the network. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is readable, with clear purpose and typical data flow, and no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for managing SSH and subprocess streams. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (around 0.1) and zero malware and obfuscation scores are justified. Overall, it appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
