  "purpose": "Facilitates the transfer of data between an SSH channel and a subprocess, managing I/O streams efficiently.",
  "sources": "Reading from SSH channel via channel.recv() and process streams via process_stream.readline().",
  "sinks": "Writing to SSH channel with channel.sendall and channel.sendall_stderr; writing to process streams.",
  "flows": "Data flows from channel.recv() to process_stream.write, and from process_stream.readline() to channel.sendall or sendall_stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code. No unusual or suspicious function calls. Use of standard selectors for I/O multiplexing.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a typical stream transfer mechanism between an SSH channel and a subprocess. It uses standard Python libraries and follows conventional I/O handling patterns. No signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden actions are evident. The code does not contain any obfuscation or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a legitimate data transfer utility.\n\nSources include channel.recv() and process_stream.readline(). Sinks include channel.sendall, channel.sendall_stderr, and process stream writes. Data flows follow expected source-to-sink paths for stream transfer. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing I/O streams between an SSH channel and subprocesses. No malicious or maliciously intended code detected. It functions as a data transfer utility without signs of sabotage or malware.",
