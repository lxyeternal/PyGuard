  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for managing SSH and subprocess streams. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (around 0.1) and zero malware and obfuscation scores are justified. Overall, it appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose."
