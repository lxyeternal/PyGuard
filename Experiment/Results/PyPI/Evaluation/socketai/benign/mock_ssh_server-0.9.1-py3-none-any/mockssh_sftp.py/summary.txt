  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an SFTP server interface with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor security risks relate to input validation and log exposure, which are operational concerns rather than malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe for use if proper input validation and log management are enforced externally."
