  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SSH server implementation with a significant security vulnerability due to executing commands via subprocess.Popen with shell=True without validation. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary concern is the potential for remote command injection, which could be exploited if the server is accessible to untrusted clients. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and a risk score of approximately 0.6 is appropriate."
