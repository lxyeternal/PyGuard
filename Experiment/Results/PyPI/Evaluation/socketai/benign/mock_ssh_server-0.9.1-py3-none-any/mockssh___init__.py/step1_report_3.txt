{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an alias for a Server class imported from the mockssh.server module, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Importing 'server' from 'mockssh', and the string assignment '__all__' for module exports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing points are present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'server' -> assignment of 'Server' -> module exports declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'server' object from the 'mockssh' library and creates an alias 'Server' for 'server.Server'. It also declares the module's public API with '__all__'. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. No credentials, network calls, or other suspicious activity is present. The module seems to serve as a simple re-export or wrapper for 'mockssh.server.Server'.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It functions as a minimal re-export or alias definition, with no suspicious or harmful activity detected.",
