  "flows": "No data flow or data manipulation within the code; just an import and assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a third-party library and exposes it in the module's namespace. There are no functions, no data handling, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious behavior or malicious intent. The minimal nature of the code indicates it serves as a simple wrapper or re-export.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a straightforward re-export of a class from an external library, with no anomalous or malicious elements.",
