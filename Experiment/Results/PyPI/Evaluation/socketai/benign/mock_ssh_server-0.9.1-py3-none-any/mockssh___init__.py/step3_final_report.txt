{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'server' module from the 'mockssh' package and re-exports 'server.Server' as 'Server' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from mockssh import server'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, outputs, or external interactions present",
  "flows": "Assignment 'Server = server.Server' creates a direct reference without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs; straightforward re-export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class from a third-party library and exposing it via __all__. No data flows, user inputs, network operations, or obfuscation are present. The code serves as a simple alias or re-export, with no malicious or security-related behaviors. All signals indicate benign intent and no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks or malicious behavior. It functions solely as a re-export of a class from the 'mockssh' package, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
