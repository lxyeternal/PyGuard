{
  "purpose": "The code imports a Server class from the mockssh library and exposes it for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the mockssh library during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations present.",
  "flows": "Importing mockssh and assigning server.Server to Server, with no further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only re-exporting a class from a third-party library without modification.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain any input reading, data processing, or output operations. It merely imports a class and exposes it. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The simplicity suggests this is a standard re-export pattern, with no malicious intent or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward re-export of a class from a third-party library, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
