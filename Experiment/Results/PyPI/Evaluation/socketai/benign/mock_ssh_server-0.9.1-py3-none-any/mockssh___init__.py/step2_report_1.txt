  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n```python\nfrom mockssh import server\n\n__all__ = [\n    \"Server\"\n]\n\nServer = server.Server\n```\n\nThis code simply imports the `server` module from the `mockssh` package, assigns `server.Server` to the name `Server`, and exposes it via `__all__`. There are no data flows, no user inputs, no network operations, and no code obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and only re-exports a class from a third-party library. No issues or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`. Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from `0` to `0.1`. Given the code's simplicity, a `0` or very low score is justified.\n\n### Justification of risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- No scores above 0.5 are assigned; all are very low or zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- Some reports mention that the `mockssh` package might be used for testing SSH functionalities, but this is context-dependent and does not imply malicious intent. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The code is a simple re-export, common in modular Python projects.\n- No vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the code and reports, **the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be 0**. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign and poses no security concerns.",
