  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code snippet:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom mockssh import server\n\n__all__ = [\n    \"Server\"\n]\n\nServer = server.Server\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is minimal, importing a module/class from a third-party library (`mockssh`) and re-exporting `server.Server` as `Server`.\n- No data flows, user inputs, or outputs are present.\n- No obfuscated code, secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code functions as a simple re-export or aliasing pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states that the code imports `server` from `mockssh` and exposes `Server`. No malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code reads the `mockssh` package and assigns `server.Server` to `Server`. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly notes the import and aliasing. No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code is a re-export with no data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also correctly identifies the minimal re-export pattern. Slightly notes a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which seems inconsistent with the rest of the analysis.\n- **Observation:** Given the code's simplicity, a `securityRisk` of 0.1 appears unjustified. There are no external calls, no data handling, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — likely overestimated.\n\n**Verdict:** The `securityRisk` score should be 0, consistent with other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- The security risk score in report 5 is slightly inflated; it should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should be 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Remains 0.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Should be 0 for report 5 to match the benign assessment.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward re-export with no security issues. The scores should reflect this.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly assess the benign nature of the code. The only adjustment needed is lowering report 5's `securityRisk` from 0.1 to 0.0. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately low across all reports.",
