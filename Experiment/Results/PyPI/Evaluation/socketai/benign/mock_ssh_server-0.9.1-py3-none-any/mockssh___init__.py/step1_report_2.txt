{
  "purpose": "The code imports a server class from the mockssh package and exposes it under the name 'Server'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'mockssh' package import and the assignment to 'Server'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only performs import and assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded credentials or unusual code constructs. It imports a 'mockssh' package which might be used for SSH simulation or testing but does not by itself indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'server' module from the 'mockssh' package and assigns 'server.Server' to the name 'Server'. It only exposes this class via __all__. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. The 'mockssh' package could be used for testing SSH functionalities; without additional context, this appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and only re-exports a class from a third-party module. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
