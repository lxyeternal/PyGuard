{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a debugging utility for dumping internal cache data of the Meson build system, including configuration options, compiler info, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads data from command line options, filesystem (build directory check), and internal Meson cache (via cdata.load).",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting internal data and cache contents to stdout.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from filesystem and internal cache; then filtered and printed to stdout based on options.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious file operations, or obfuscated code are present. Usage of standard library functions and straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages command-line argument parsing and displays cached build data. It verifies directory existence before proceeding, loads internal cache via cdata.load, and conditionally prints various build configuration details. No untrusted input handling or unsafe data processing is observed. The code does not perform network operations, system modifications, or contain hidden backdoors. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; it appears to be a standard debugging tool. The data printed is internal cache info, with no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a debugging utility to dump internal Meson cache data. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or malware. Its purpose is to aid developers in debugging build configurations. Overall security risk is minimal.",
