{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to dump and display internal cache data from the Meson build system for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include command-line arguments ('options'), filesystem checks (os.path.isdir), and loaded data from 'cdata.load()'.",
  "sinks": "Output to the console via print statements, which display data retrieved from internal cache and system checks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line options and filesystem checks into print statements that output debug information; internal cache data is retrieved and formatted for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of os.path and pprint is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious network activity present. No dynamic code execution or unsafe input handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles command-line argument parsing, filesystem verification, and printing internal cache data from the Meson build system. It uses standard library functions and well-defined data structures without any signs of malicious behavior. No untrusted data processing or insecure practices are evident. The purpose is solely for debugging and diagnostics, with no indications of hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward debugging utility that displays internal cache data from the Meson build system. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It solely reads internal data and outputs it for user inspection.",
