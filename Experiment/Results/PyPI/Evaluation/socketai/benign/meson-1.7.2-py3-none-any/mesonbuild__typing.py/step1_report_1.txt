{
  "purpose": "Provide typing helper classes and protocols for the Meson build system, focusing on type safety and immutability interfaces.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and method definitions, type annotations, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data input or output points observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines protocols and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Python typing protocols and helper classes for use within the Meson build system. It imports necessary modules and extensions, such as typing and typing_extensions. The class definitions specify method signatures and behaviors expected of conforming objects, facilitating static type checking. No input/output operations, network interactions, or dynamic code execution are present. The structure and content are consistent with standard type hinting and interface protocols, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of type protocols and helper classes for static type checking purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears safe and solely intended to improve type safety within the Meson project.",
