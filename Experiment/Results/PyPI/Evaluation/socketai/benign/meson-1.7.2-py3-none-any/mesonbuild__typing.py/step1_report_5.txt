{
  "purpose": "Provide typing helpers and protocols for use within the Meson build system, mainly defining interfaces for immutable list-like structures and string protocols.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code defines interfaces and type signatures without actual data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type protocol definitions using Python's typing system and typing_extensions. It imports standard typing modules and defines several protocol classes to specify expected methods for string-like objects and list-like objects that are immutable. There are no data inputs, outputs, or runtime logic that could be exploited or manipulated maliciously. The code is static, intended for type checking, and contains no dynamic or external data interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as type helper definitions for the Meson project. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
