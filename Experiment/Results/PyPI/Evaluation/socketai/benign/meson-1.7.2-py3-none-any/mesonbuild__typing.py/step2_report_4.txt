  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as purely defining Python typing protocols and helper classes for static type checking.\n- No input/output, network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is consistent with standard Python typing practices and is intended solely for interface and type safety purposes within the Meson build system.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports from `typing` and `typing_extensions`, defines protocols like `StringProtocol`, `SizedStringProtocol`, and `ImmutableListProtocol`.\n- Method signatures and docstrings are consistent and standard.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or security risks.\n- The reports uniformly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's purpose and content.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — appropriate, as the code is purely structural and static.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The only point to consider is whether the code could be misused if imported into a malicious context. However, since it only defines protocols and type hints, this is unlikely.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their scoring.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard implementation of typing protocols.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely for static type checking, with no runtime behavior, data handling, or external interactions. The uniform reports support this conclusion, and there are no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or security concerns. The scoring is accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
