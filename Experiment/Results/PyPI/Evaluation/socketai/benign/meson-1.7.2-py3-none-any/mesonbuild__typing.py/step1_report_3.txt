{
  "purpose": "Defines typing helper protocols for use in the Meson build system, including immutable list and string protocols.",
  "sources": "Import statements for typing and typing_extensions; class definitions for protocols.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data input/output operations or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling; the code mainly provides type annotations and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares protocol classes for static type checking purposes, including StringProtocol, SizedStringProtocol, and ImmutableListProtocol. It uses standard Python typing features, with no runtime code execution or data manipulation. No source-to-sink data flow exists, as this code is purely type hints and interface definitions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard typing protocol definitions for static analysis and does not contain malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a foundation for type safety in the Meson project.",
