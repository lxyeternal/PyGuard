{
  "purpose": "The code defines Python typing protocols and helper classes to facilitate static type checking within the Meson build system, ensuring type safety and interface consistency.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported modules 'typing' and 'typing_extensions' to define protocols and type variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or sinks; the code contains only static type definitions with no runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "The code establishes source-to-sink paths only within static type annotations, with no dynamic data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and purely structural.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type protocol definitions for string-like objects and immutable list-like structures, with method signatures and docstrings. It imports standard typing modules and contains no runtime logic, data input/output, or external network interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with its purpose and content. The code's purpose is solely for static analysis and type safety, which inherently poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Python typing protocols intended for static type checking. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
