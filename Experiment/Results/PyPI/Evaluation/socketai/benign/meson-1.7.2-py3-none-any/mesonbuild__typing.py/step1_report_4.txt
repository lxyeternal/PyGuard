{
  "purpose": "Provide typing helper classes and protocols for safer code practices in the Meson build system.",
  "sources": "Import of typing and typing_extensions modules, class definitions, method signatures, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks are present. The code mainly defines protocols and type hints.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as the code only defines classes and protocols without runtime data flow or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is purely structural typing helpers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type hinting protocols and helper classes intended for static type checking. It imports modules safely, defines classes with method signatures, and contains no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no code injection mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, purely structural component used for type checking. It does not contain malware or security risks. Its purpose is to define type protocols for use elsewhere in the codebase.",
