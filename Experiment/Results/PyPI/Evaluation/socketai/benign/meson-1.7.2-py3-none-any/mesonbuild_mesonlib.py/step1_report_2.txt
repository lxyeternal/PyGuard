{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions and classes for a larger project, importing platform-specific modules based on the operating system.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), and imports modules from the relative utils package.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any clear sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or effects. It only performs conditional imports.",
  "flows": "os.name -> conditional import of platform-specific modules",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be straightforward platform-based module imports with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports utility modules based on the operating system, which is a standard approach for cross-platform compatibility. It reads the environment variable 'os.name' to determine the OS type, then conditionally imports the appropriate modules. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The comments and license information are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The import statements are static, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical platform-specific import setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, benign pattern used in cross-platform Python projects.",
