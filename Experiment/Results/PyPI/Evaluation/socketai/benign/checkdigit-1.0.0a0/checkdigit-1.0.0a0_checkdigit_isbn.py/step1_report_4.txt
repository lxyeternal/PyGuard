{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to calculate and validate ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 check digits, as well as to find a missing digit in ISBN codes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through function parameters (strings), particularly the 'data' argument in each function, and via 'convert' and 'cleanse' functions imported from an external module.",
  "sinks": "Returns calculated check digits or boolean validation results. Uses 'convert' for output formatting. No external data sinks or side effects are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input data is cleansed via 'cleanse'. Calculations process data to produce check digits or validation status. The 'missing' function iterates over possible digits to find a valid missing value by calling validation functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for ISBN validation; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. Uses a brute-force approach in 'missing', which is normal for such functionality but could be inefficient. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, implementing known algorithms for ISBN check digit calculation and validation. It relies on external 'cleanse' and 'convert' functions, which are not detailed here, but are likely for input sanitization and formatting. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling are present. No external network calls, file operations, or environment variable usage. The brute-force method in 'missing' is typical for such use cases and not inherently malicious. Overall, the code aligns with standard ISBN processing routines without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation for ISBN checksum calculation and validation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code functions as intended for its purpose, with no suspicious anomalies or harmful actions.",
