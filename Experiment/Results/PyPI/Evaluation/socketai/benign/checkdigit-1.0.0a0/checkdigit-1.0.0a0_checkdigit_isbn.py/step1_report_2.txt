{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to calculate and validate ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 check digits, as well as to find missing digits in ISBN codes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments (strings representing ISBN codes) and cleanses data via the 'cleanse' function imported from checkdigit.data.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are check digit strings or boolean validation results; no untrusted data is written or transmitted within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input data is cleansed, processed through checksum calculations, and validated. No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs straightforward checksum calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements ISBN checksum algorithms, involving data cleansing, numeric computations, and validation functions. It uses only standard arithmetic and imported helper functions for cleansing and conversion. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions operate solely on provided input strings and produce checksum results or validation booleans. The brute-force method for missing digits is benign in this context. No hardcoded credentials, sensitive info, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of ISBN checksum calculations with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a utility module for ISBN validation purposes only.",
