{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to calculate and validate ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 check digits, as well as to determine missing digits in ISBN codes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, specifically ISBN strings, and processes them for checksum calculations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted or external data directly; it mainly processes provided ISBN data for validation and calculation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments through cleansing and checksum functions, resulting in either check digit outputs or validation boolean results. There are no external data transmissions or untrusted data flows to other systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code relies on external 'checkdigit.data' module functions 'cleanse' and 'convert', but these are standard data processing functions, not malicious. No obfuscated or misleading code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement standard ISBN checksum calculations with proper input cleansing and validation. It uses straightforward arithmetic and control flow without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. External functions 'cleanse' and 'convert' are imported, but their typical purpose (data sanitization and conversion) does not suggest malicious intent. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is focused solely on checksum computations and validation, consistent with typical utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of ISBN checksum algorithms with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as expected for its purpose and does not contain suspicious or harmful code.",
