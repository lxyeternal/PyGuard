  "purpose": "Calculate parity bit for binary data, appending '0' or '1' based on even or odd parity.",
  "sources": "Input data string passed to 'calculate' function, processed by 'cleanse'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; data is sanitized and returned with appended parity bit.",
  "flows": "Input data -> 'cleanse' -> parity calculation -> output with appended bit.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external 'checkdigit.data.cleanse' function without provided implementation; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard parity calculation, appending a '0' or '1' based on the count of '1's in the input data. It relies on an external 'cleanse' function for sanitization, which is not shown but presumed benign. No network activity, file access, or system modifications are present. The logic is straightforward, well-documented, and free of obfuscation. The only potential concern is the trustworthiness of 'cleanse', but there is no evidence of malicious behavior. All reports agree on the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, low security risk, and high confidence in safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard parity calculator with a data sanitization step. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
