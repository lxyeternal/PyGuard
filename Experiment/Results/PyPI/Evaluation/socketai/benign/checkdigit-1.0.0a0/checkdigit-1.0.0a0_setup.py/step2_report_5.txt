  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- It uses static data, no dynamic input, no external data sources.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Presence of Issues:**\n- The code does not contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n- All reports correctly identify it as a straightforward setup script.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n- No errors or flaws are detected in the logic or reasoning.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1; this is reasonable given the static configuration nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the clear, readable code.\n\n**Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all assessments are cautious and accurate.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is a standard setup.py with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The detailed descriptions and badge links do not introduce any security concerns.\n- The assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe script is a benign, typical packaging configuration for a Python library, with no indications of supply chain risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, straightforward, and free of malware or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
