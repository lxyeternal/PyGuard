{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'checkdigit' Python package, including metadata, package data, and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package list, package data, and setup parameters; no external or untrusted input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the setup() function to initiate package installation, which is a standard build process; no data is sent or leaked outside this process.",
  "flows": "Static data from the variables flows into the setup() function call without manipulation, serving as configuration for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors; the code is a straightforward setup script with well-structured metadata. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package data and metadata variables, and calls setup() with these parameters. All data is hardcoded, with no user input, environment variable reading, or external data fetching. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It does not include any malware, backdoors, or security risks beyond normal package metadata. It appears safe and legitimate.",
