  "purpose": "This code is a static setup.py configuration script for packaging the 'checkdigit' Python library, containing metadata and package data definitions.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, package data, and configuration parameters hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; the script solely defines static data for package setup.",
  "flows": "Static data flows into the setup() function, with no dynamic or external data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; the script is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup.py script for Python packaging, with no dynamic code, external data, or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any network operations, handle untrusted input, or contain obfuscation. All indicators point to benign, intended use. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the static, well-understood nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. All reports correctly identify its safe and static nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
