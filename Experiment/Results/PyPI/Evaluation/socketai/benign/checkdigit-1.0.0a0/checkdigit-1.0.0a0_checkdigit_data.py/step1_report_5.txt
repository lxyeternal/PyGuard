{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing barcode data, specifically cleansing input data and converting digits for barcode representations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the 'data' parameter in 'cleanse' and 'digit' parameter in 'convert'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or places where untrusted data affects sensitive operations or leads to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data is cleansed by 'cleanse'; 'convert' transforms digits into barcode characters. No flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs straightforward string processing and digit conversion without external calls or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform basic string replacement and digit-to-character conversions without external dependencies or network activity. There are no obfuscated or suspicious code features. The code appears benign, serving a utility purpose for barcode data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs simple data cleansing and conversion functions with no external interactions or sensitive data handling.",
