{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for cleansing input data and converting digits for barcode or ISBN processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters 'data' and 'digit'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code; it does not write data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to return statements after processing; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The 'cleanse' function removes hyphens and spaces from input strings, likely for barcode processing. The 'convert' function maps numeric digits to characters, handling special cases for 10 and 11, replacing them with 'X' or '0' as appropriate. The code appears straightforward, with no external dependencies, no network access, and no suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for data normalization and digit conversion related to barcodes or ISBNs. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
