{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for cleansing barcode data and converting digits to barcode characters, likely for ISBN or similar codes.",
  "sources": "The 'cleanse' function reads input data (string), and the 'convert' function takes an integer digit as input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code that could lead to data leaks, code injection, or other security issues.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through 'cleanse' for sanitization; 'convert' processes digit input for barcode representation. No untrusted data flows to dangerous functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions perform straightforward string and numeric manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple utility functions with clear, limited scope. 'cleanse' removes hyphens and spaces, which is a benign sanitization. 'convert' maps digits to characters, with special handling for 10 and 11, based on barcode type. No external data sources, network calls, or obfuscated code are involved. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves straightforward data processing purposes with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
