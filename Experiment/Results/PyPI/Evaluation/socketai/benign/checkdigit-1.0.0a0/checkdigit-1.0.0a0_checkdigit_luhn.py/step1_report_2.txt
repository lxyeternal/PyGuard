{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to calculate, validate, and find missing digits in a Luhn checksum for given data strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, particularly the 'data' parameter in 'calculate', 'validate', and 'missing' functions. It also imports 'cleanse' and 'convert' functions from an external module 'checkdigit.data'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the check digit or validation result, but does not write or transmit data outside the process. No sinks are present that leak untrusted data or cause side effects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters to 'cleanse' functions, then through calculations, and finally results are returned. No external network or file operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code uses standard algorithms and external functions for data cleansing and conversion. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Luhn checksum algorithm with functions to calculate, validate, and find missing digits in the checksum. It relies on external 'cleanse' and 'convert' functions, which are assumed to handle data sanitization and conversions securely. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The implementation appears straightforward and adheres to expected practices for checksum calculations. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of the Luhn checksum algorithm without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs expected calculations and validation steps securely, assuming external functions are safe. No malware or security risks identified.",
