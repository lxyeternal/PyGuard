  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a request builder for Microsoft Graph API subscriptions; sources are typical method parameters and imported modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network request functions (`send_async`, `send_no_response_content_async`) are potential sinks; data flows from parameters into request info objects.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials or backdoors; the placeholder `'XXX'` in `error_mapping` is suspicious but likely a placeholder.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK pattern, no malicious behavior. The `'XXX'` key in `error_mapping` is probably an incomplete placeholder, not a security issue.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0. Not unreasonable given the placeholder.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar observations: standard SDK pattern, potential network sinks, placeholder `'XXX'` in error mapping.\n- No suspicious code or obfuscation; deprecation warnings are benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0. Not unreasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: typical request builder, no malicious activity, placeholder `'XXX'` in error mapping.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with previous: standard API SDK code, no malicious behavior, placeholder `'XXX'`.\n- No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis: typical request builder, no malicious activity, placeholder `'XXX'`.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard, SDK-generated request builder for Microsoft Graph API. It performs typical CRUD operations with proper request setup.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The network request functions are standard and do not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Placeholder Use:** The `'XXX'` key in `error_mapping` is suspicious but appears to be a placeholder or incomplete code, not malicious.\n- **Deprecation Warnings:** Present but benign, related to code generation and not security issues.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, primarily related to incomplete error mapping, which does not constitute a security threat.\n\n### Final Scores & Justification:\n\n| Aspect            | Estimated Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**      | **0**           | No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated malware.                                |\n| **Obfuscated**   | **0**           | Code is clear, standard SDK pattern, no obfuscation detected.                                |\n| **Security Risk**| **0.1 - 0.2**   | Minimal, mainly due to placeholder `'XXX'` in error mapping, which is likely incomplete.   |\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 (minor concern about incomplete error mapping placeholder, but not a security issue)\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nThe main point of attention is the `'XXX'` placeholder in `error_mapping`. It should be replaced with proper error codes (e.g., `\"4XX\"`, `\"5XX\"`). This is a minor code quality issue, not a security concern.\n\n**Summary:** The code is legitimate, standard SDK code with no malicious intent. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score reflecting the placeholder anomaly.",
