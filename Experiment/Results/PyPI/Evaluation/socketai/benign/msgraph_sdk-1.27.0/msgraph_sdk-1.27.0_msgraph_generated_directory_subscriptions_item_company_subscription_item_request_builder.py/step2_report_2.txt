  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's structure, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  The code appears consistent with SDK patterns. The only notable anomaly is the placeholder `'XXX'` in `error_mapping`. This is likely an incomplete placeholder rather than malicious code.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The `'XXX'` key in `error_mapping` is suspicious. Typically, error mappings should map HTTP status codes (like `'4XX'`, `'5XX'`) or specific error strings. `'XXX'` seems to be a placeholder, possibly an oversight.\n\n- **Scores and justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — low, since no actual vulnerabilities are evident.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - The deprecation warnings are benign, indicating outdated classes but not security issues.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The code is standard SDK code, with a minor placeholder issue in error mapping, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Similar to Report 1, the `'XXX'` key in `error_mapping` is suspicious. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The placeholder `'XXX'` indicates incomplete or placeholder code, which could lead to unhandled errors but not malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores and justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — minimal, just a placeholder.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Again, the `'XXX'` key in `error_mapping` appears, likely a placeholder. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  Same as above, possibly incomplete error handling setup.\n\n- **Scores and justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — placeholder issue, not security risk.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Standard SDK code, no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Consistent with previous, the `'XXX'` key in `error_mapping` is suspicious but not malicious.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  Placeholder likely; no security implications.\n\n- **Scores and justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  Same pattern; `'XXX'` in `error_mapping`.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  Placeholder issue, not security-related.\n\n- **Scores and justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher but still minimal, possibly due to placeholder concern)\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The code is benign SDK code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across reports; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (around 0.1–0.2), primarily due to placeholder error mapping entries, which are not security risks but indicate incomplete code or documentation.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The primary anomaly across all reports is the `'XXX'` placeholder in `error_mapping`. This is likely an incomplete or placeholder implementation, not malicious code.\n- No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity.\n- The code is consistent with SDK-generated request builders for Microsoft Graph API, following standard patterns.\n\n### Recommended scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor placeholder issue, not security-related.\n\n**Note:** The deprecation warnings are benign and typical in generated SDK code.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate SDK request builder with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The only concern is the `'XXX'` placeholder in error mapping, which should be corrected but does not pose a security threat.",
