  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SDK pattern; reads from method params and imported modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network request functions (`send_async`, `send_no_response_content_async`) are typical sinks; data flows from parameters into request info objects.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The placeholder `'XXX'` in `error_mapping` is suspicious but likely a placeholder or incomplete code, not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** The code appears to be a typical generated SDK class for Microsoft Graph API. It performs standard request setup, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected. The only concern is the `'XXX'` placeholder in `error_mapping`, which should be verified but is not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2 (low, due to placeholder concern).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard API client code, reading configuration, request bodies, URLs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network calls via `send_async`, data serialization.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or suspicious URL manipulations. The `'XXX'` key in `error_mapping` again appears as a placeholder.\n- **Analysis:** Typical SDK pattern, safe and standard. No malicious behaviors. The placeholder indicates incomplete code but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—request builder for API CRUD operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request functions transmitting data over network.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, suspicious code. `'XXX'` key in `error_mapping` again seems placeholder.\n- **Analysis:** Standard SDK code, safe, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard API request builder, reads configs, request bodies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests via request adapter.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL manipulations. Deprecated warnings are benign.\n- **Analysis:** Typical SDK pattern, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks or malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern, managing subscriptions via API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests, data serialization.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets. Deprecated warnings are benign.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, legitimate SDK code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. All reports describe standard SDK patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score justification:** Zero across all reports. The code does not perform any malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; mainly the placeholder `'XXX'` in error mappings, which suggests incomplete code rather than malicious intent.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The `'XXX'` placeholder in `error_mapping` should be corrected or verified, but it does not constitute a security risk.\n- The deprecation warnings in configuration classes are benign and typical in SDKs.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, standard code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — very low, primarily due to placeholder code that should be reviewed but not malicious.\n\n**In conclusion,** this code is a typical, legitimate SDK request builder with no malicious activity. The main point is to verify the placeholder `'XXX'` in `error_mapping`, which appears to be an incomplete or placeholder entry, not a security concern.",
