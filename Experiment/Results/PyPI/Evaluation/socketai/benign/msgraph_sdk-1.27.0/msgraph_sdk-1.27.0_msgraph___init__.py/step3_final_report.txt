  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python SDK module for Microsoft Graph API, importing version info and core classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_version, graph_request_adapter, graph_service_client), assignment of VERSION to __version__",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network activity, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows or untrusted data paths",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, serving as an SDK entry point with no dynamic behavior, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of security concerns. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK module initializer with no malicious or security issues. All reports are accurate and consistent. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1, reflecting the minimal risk profile.",
