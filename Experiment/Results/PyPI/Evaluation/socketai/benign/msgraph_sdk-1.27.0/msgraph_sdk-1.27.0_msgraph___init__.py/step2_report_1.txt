  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple, minimal module that imports version info and core classes for a Microsoft Graph API client.\n- No data flows, sinks, or external inputs are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code is consistent with standard SDK initialization modules.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign and straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** The securityRisk score is very low, which seems appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states the code is benign, with perfect confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, straightforward and benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low (0.1 in report 1, 0 elsewhere), which aligns with the minimal, non-sensitive nature of the code.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- The code in question is a standard, minimal SDK module with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned across reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No evidence suggests higher malware or obfuscation risks.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in this minimal setup)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider the broader context—if this code is part of a larger package, further review of the entire SDK would be necessary. But based solely on this snippet, there are no concerns.",
