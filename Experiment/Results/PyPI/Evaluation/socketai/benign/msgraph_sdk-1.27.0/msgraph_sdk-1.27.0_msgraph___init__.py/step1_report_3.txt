  "purpose": "To provide a Python client library for interacting with the Microsoft Graph API",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (. _version, .graph_request_adapter, .graph_service_client)",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is being processed or outputted",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily imports and sets a version variable",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, consisting of module imports and version assignment; no suspicious or unusual code features",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module with imports from local files and assigns a version number. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. It appears to be a straightforward library initialization file. No suspicious code, obfuscated features, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module initializer for a Python SDK. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident based on this fragment.",
