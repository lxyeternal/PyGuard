  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure the findings are accurate and consistent.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and a version assignment.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard for a client SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Score: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1**\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward. The risk score is very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Acceptable; no change needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Score: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0**\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious indicators or obfuscation. The risk score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Score: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the minimal, benign code.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Score: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0**\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Score: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0**\n- **Assessment:** Matches the benign nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low or zero, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable given the slight risk due to being part of an SDK that could be misused if compromised)\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a simple, standard module for a Python SDK, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to acknowledge the potential, albeit minimal, risk inherent in SDK modules that could be misused if compromised)\n\n**Note:** If further context indicates the SDK is from a trusted source, the risk score could be set to 0.",
