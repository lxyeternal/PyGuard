  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The report correctly states that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data flows.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The low risk score seems appropriate given the simplicity and lack of security concerns.  \n- **Justification:** No issues identified; the report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; the code is just module imports and version setting, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. No reason to increase the risk score.  \n- **Justification:** The report is accurate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Again, the code is minimal and standard.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Justification:** Correct assessment.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same conclusion—benign, standard module setup.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Justification:** Consistent with the code.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Justification:** Accurate.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no malicious behavior observed or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.  \n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable considering the code is purely structural and part of an SDK setup, with no data handling or network activity.  \n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The code is extremely minimal and standard for an SDK module, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.  \n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present.  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.  \n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)  \n\nThis aligns with the code's simplicity and the comprehensive analysis provided.",
