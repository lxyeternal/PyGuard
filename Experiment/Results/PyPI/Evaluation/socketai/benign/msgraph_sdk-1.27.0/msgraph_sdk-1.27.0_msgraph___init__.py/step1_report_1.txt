{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python client interface for the Microsoft Graph API, likely used to facilitate communication with Microsoft's cloud services.",
  "sources": "The code imports version information and two classes for request handling and client interaction from local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code segment; no data is processed, stored, or transmitted here.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists within this minimal code; it mainly defines imports and a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports version info and two components necessary for a Graph API client. It only assigns the imported VERSION to __version__, serving as module metadata. No data input, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection. The simplicity and conventional structure suggest it is a benign part of a larger SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard module setup for a Python Microsoft Graph API client. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation within this segment.",
