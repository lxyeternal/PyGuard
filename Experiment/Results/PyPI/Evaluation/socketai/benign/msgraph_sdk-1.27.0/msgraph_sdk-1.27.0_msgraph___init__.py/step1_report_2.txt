  "purpose": "This code is a simple Python module that serves as a client for the Microsoft Graph API, providing imports and version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: _version, graph_request_adapter, graph_service_client",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations are present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and assigns version info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is limited to importing modules and setting a version variable. There are no inputs, no processing, and no outputs beyond module imports. No data handling, user input, or network activity present. It appears to be part of a larger SDK or client library, with no signs of malicious code or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious module setup for a Microsoft Graph API client. No indicators of malware or security risks are observed.",
