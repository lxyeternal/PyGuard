  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for managing subscriptions via Microsoft Graph API. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The placeholder 'XXX' in error_mapping suggests incomplete setup but not malicious intent. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate; the slight increase in security risk score (to about 0.3) reflects the placeholder but does not indicate a security threat."
