There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The placeholder 'XXX' in error_mapping suggests incomplete setup but not malicious intent. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate; the slight increase in security risk score (to about 0.3) reflects the placeholder but does not indicate a security threat."

The anomalies are minor and related to configuration placeholders and deprecation warnings, not security threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), primarily due to minor configuration issues.
