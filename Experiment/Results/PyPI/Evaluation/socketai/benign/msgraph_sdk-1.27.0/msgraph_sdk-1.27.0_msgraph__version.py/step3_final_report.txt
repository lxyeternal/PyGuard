  "purpose": "Static assignment of a version string for release management purposes.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static string assignment in code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; straightforward variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Comments indicating release boundaries are standard; no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static string assignment with comments for release versioning. No external data, no dynamic behavior, no obfuscation, and no malicious constructs are present. All indicators point to benign, straightforward code. The comments are standard for version control and do not imply malicious intent. No data flows or sinks exist that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
