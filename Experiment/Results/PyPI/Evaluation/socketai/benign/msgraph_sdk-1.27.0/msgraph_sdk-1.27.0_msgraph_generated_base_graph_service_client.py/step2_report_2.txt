  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary & Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** The code is a client SDK for Microsoft Graph, providing access via properties and methods.\n- **Sources & Flows:** Uses parameters like `app_id`, `unique_name`, etc., validates them, and returns request builder instances.\n- **Anomalies:** Repetitive pattern, possible code generation, no obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is a standard SDK pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies this as a typical SDK class with no malicious intent. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary & Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Main client class for Microsoft Graph SDK, providing accessors for API endpoints.\n- **Sources & Flows:** Similar pattern with parameters, dynamic imports, and property methods.\n- **Anomalies:** Extensive repetitive patterns, no secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard SDK design, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign SDK code, safe, no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary & Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client class for Microsoft Graph API, with property accessors and initialization logic.\n- **Sources & Flows:** Uses constructor parameters, sets base URL, property methods instantiate request builders.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Use of dynamic imports is typical.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK code, safe, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary & Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client class for Microsoft Graph API, with accessors and configuration.\n- **Sources & Flows:** Similar pattern—parameters validated, dynamic imports, request builder instantiation.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, typical SDK pattern.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no backdoors, no code injection.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, legitimate SDK code, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary & Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client class for Microsoft Graph API, with property accessors and initialization.\n- **Sources & Flows:** Similar pattern, parameter validation, dynamic imports, property methods.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, standard SDK design.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK code, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. The code is primarily a structured SDK client, with no network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear, structured, and appears to be generated or boilerplate SDK code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in all reports (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security risk, mainly due to dynamic imports and parameter validation, which are standard in SDKs.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity, no code injection, no network exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, pattern is typical for SDKs, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, considering the code is an SDK setup, with standard practices and no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Additional notes:** The extensive repetitive patterns and dynamic imports are typical for modular SDKs and do not indicate malicious obfuscation or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
