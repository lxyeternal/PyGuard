  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the reasoning provided.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a client SDK class for Microsoft Graph, with no malicious intent. It validates parameters, dynamically imports request builder classes, and sets up serializers/deserializers.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The high confidence (0.9) and zero malware score align with this assessment.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard SDK boilerplate, with no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward SDK structure, dynamic imports, and parameter validation.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The dynamic import pattern is typical for modular SDKs.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is consistent. No malware or security risk detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the initialization and property accessors, validating parameters, setting base URL, and importing request builder modules.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is typical for SDK setup.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is appropriate; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Highlights the extensive use of property methods, dynamic imports, and setup procedures. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The pattern is standard for SDKs.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the parameter validation, dynamic imports, and standard SDK patterns.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is a typical SDK client class.\n- **Verdict:** The conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's structure.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Code Behavior:** The code is a well-structured, modular SDK client for Microsoft Graph API, primarily responsible for providing access to various endpoints via properties and methods.\n- **Potential Risks:** No evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- **Parameter Handling:** Proper validation for null parameters.\n- **Import Patterns:** Use of local dynamic imports is typical for SDK modularity and lazy loading, not malicious obfuscation.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Maintain low, around 0.1-0.2, as the code itself does not introduce security risks.\n- **Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), given the consistent pattern across reports.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign SDK client implementation with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It functions as an organized interface for API interactions, with parameter validation and modular import patterns typical for such SDKs.\n\n**Final malware score:** 0  \n**Final obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Final risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal inherent risk in SDK setup)",
