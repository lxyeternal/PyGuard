  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data flow, potential sinks, anomalies, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a client SDK class that provides access to Microsoft Graph API endpoints via properties and methods, primarily reading from parameters and internal attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The class constructs request builder instances, which may later perform network requests, but no actual network activity or data processing occurs here.\n- **Anomalies:** Extensive repetitive property patterns, possibly generated code; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK pattern, validating parameters, importing classes, and providing structured access. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The risk score is appropriately low (0.2), and malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on a main client class for SDK access, with dynamic imports and property methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Instantiates request builder classes, no network or code execution shown.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of dynamic imports within methods, which is typical for modular SDKs; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** This is a benign SDK setup, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The high confidence (0.9) and malware score (0) are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar purpose, with emphasis on property methods that instantiate request builders; input parameters validated.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Constructs request objects, no network activity or code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; dynamic imports are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK pattern, no malicious intent. Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a client class with property accessors, initializing serializers/deserializers, setting base URL.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Instantiates request builders; no malicious network or code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of local dynamic imports, which is typical for modular SDKs; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK code, no malicious activity or obfuscation. Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK client class, with parameter validation and dynamic import patterns.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Instantiates request builders; no network or malicious code.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation; pattern is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clear, legitimate SDK code, with no signs of malicious behavior. Scores align.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. The scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all are straightforward SDK patterns.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of SDK setup code.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation patterns.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal risk, mainly due to dynamic imports which are standard in SDKs but could be exploited if malicious modules are present. However, in this context, they appear legitimate.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical, well-structured SDK client class, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis.",
