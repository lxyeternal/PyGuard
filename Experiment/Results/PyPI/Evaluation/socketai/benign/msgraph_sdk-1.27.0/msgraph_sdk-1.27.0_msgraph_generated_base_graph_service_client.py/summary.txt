  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK client class with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It employs typical patterns for modular SDK design, with proper parameter validation and resource access methods. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the low inherent risk of SDK setup code."
