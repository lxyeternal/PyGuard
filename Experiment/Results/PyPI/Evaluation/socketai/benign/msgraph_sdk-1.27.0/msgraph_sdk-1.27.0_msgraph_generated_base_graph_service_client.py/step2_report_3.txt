  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the class as an SDK client for Microsoft Graph, sourcing data from parameters and internal attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network operations or code execution; primarily object instantiation.\n- **Anomalies:** Repetitive property patterns suggest code generation; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard SDK boilerplate, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It validates parameters and constructs request builders without executing any untrusted code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar observations: straightforward SDK pattern, dynamic imports, parameter validation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the class setup, property methods, and initialization logic.\n- No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation; standard SDK design.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Emphasizes the dynamic import pattern, parameter validation, and setting of base URL.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, confirms the code as a standard SDK client with property accessors and lazy loading.\n- No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — fitting.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a typical SDK client, with no security vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports agree on zero malware and obfuscation scores.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports, but justified by the nature of SDK boilerplate code, which involves dynamic imports and parameter validation but no malicious activity.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The dynamic import pattern, extensive property definitions, and parameter validation are standard for modular SDKs designed for extensibility.\n- No network calls, data exfiltration, code injection, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code functions as a structured interface to the Microsoft Graph API, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal, justified by the dynamic import pattern and SDK design, but not risky.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK client with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain low.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is standard SDK boilerplate.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- Scores are appropriate; I would keep malware and obfuscated at 0, risk at around 0.1-0.2.",
