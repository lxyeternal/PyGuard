  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard SDK client setup; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request adapters and request builders are used for API calls; credentials are handled properly.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder URL parameter ('me-token-to-replace') is intended for runtime replacement, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The code aligns with typical SDK patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on credential handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper use of authentication providers and request adapters.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder URL ('me-token-to-replace') is standard for dynamic URL substitution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; standard SDK design.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on client initialization and URL parameter modification.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper flow from credentials to request execution.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder URL is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious code; standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK client pattern; no secrets hardcoded.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper request setup.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder URL for 'user%2Did' is typical for URL templating.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SDK setup; credentials handled dynamically.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper request and token handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; URL placeholders are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, standard code structure.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern—mainly due to placeholder URL parameters, which are standard in SDKs.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a typical, well-structured SDK client for Microsoft Graph API. The placeholder URL parameters are standard for dynamic URL replacement and do not indicate malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the potential for misuse if credentials are mishandled outside this code, but the code itself is secure.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports and analysis)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate SDK code with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified given the placeholder URLs, which are typical in such SDKs.",
