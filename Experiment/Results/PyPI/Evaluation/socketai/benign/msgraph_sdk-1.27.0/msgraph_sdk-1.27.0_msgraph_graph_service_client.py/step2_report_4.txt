  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a standard SDK client with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None identified. The placeholder URL parameter ('me-token-to-replace') is typical for SDKs that perform dynamic URL replacement.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. These seem appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for Risk Score:** Low risk (0.1) is justified; no vulnerabilities or malicious activity detected.\n- **Overall:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is straightforward SDK code, with no malicious intent.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The placeholder URL is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Slightly higher but still reasonable; the risk is minimal.\n- **Justification for Risk Score:** The low score is justified, given no suspicious activity.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a typical SDK setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. Placeholder URL is intended for runtime replacement.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Justification for Risk Score:** The low risk is justified.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a standard SDK client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. Placeholder URL is a common pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification for Risk Score:** Low risk justified.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Again, a typical SDK client setup.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification for Risk Score:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. The code is a legitimate SDK client for Microsoft Graph API.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports assign 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varying but all low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's transparency.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose, structure, and lack of suspicious behavior, a risk score of **0.1** to **0.2** is appropriate. The reports' scores are reasonable.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly conservative, reflecting minimal inherent risk in SDK code, but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, well-structured SDK client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
