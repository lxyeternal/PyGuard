  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SDK pattern; reads configuration, path parameters, user input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into request info objects, then network requests.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; only note is the deprecation warning in request configuration classes, which is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. Error mapping with \"XXX\" is likely a placeholder, not malicious.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** High confidence (1). Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar standard SDK pattern; reads request parameters, body, URL info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into request info, then network transmission.\n- **Anomalies:** 'warn' in dataclasses, 'XXX' key in error mapping (non-standard). No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK code; 'XXX' likely placeholder, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9). Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Security risk: 0.1 (due to placeholder and warnings).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard resource management; input via parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request info creation, then send_async.\n- **Anomalies:** Deprecated warnings, 'XXX' key in error mapping (non-standard). No malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Likely auto-generated SDK code; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Security risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Typical request builder pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into request info, then network.\n- **Anomalies:** 'warn' in dataclasses, 'XXX' key in error mapping (placeholder). No malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard API request management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request info creation, then send over network.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, only 'XXX' in error mapping (likely placeholder). No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK code, safe.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Security risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** No. All reports describe standard SDK patterns, request building, and network transmission.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious code, payloads, or backdoors.\n- **Security risk:** Minimal; mainly due to placeholders and deprecation warnings, which are typical artifacts of code generation.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The placeholder 'XXX' in error mappings is likely an incomplete or auto-generated artifact, not malicious.\n- The deprecation warnings in dataclasses are benign and indicate ongoing maintenance or code evolution.\n- No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code is present.\n\n### **My estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low; mainly due to placeholders and warnings, not actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, legitimate SDK-style implementation for API resource management, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
