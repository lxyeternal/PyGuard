  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard SDK class for managing 'directory' resource.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Reads config data, parameters; sends requests via 'send_async'.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; deprecation warnings are benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, backdoors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Overall reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar SDK class with CRUD and sub-resource management.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Reads request data, constructs requests, sends via 'send_async'.\n- **Anomalies:** 'warn' in deprecated classes, placeholder 'XXX' in error mapping.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; placeholder suggests incomplete code or code generation artifact.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly elevated but acceptable given incomplete code). \n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Request builder for 'directory' resource.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Reads parameters, serializes data, sends requests.\n- **Anomalies:** Deprecated warnings, placeholder 'XXX' in error mapping.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; placeholder error key likely incomplete code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (slightly higher but still low).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard SDK request builder.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Similar data flow; uses 'send_async'.\n- **Anomalies:** Deprecated warnings, placeholder 'XXX'.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above SDK pattern.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Standard request construction and execution.\n- **Anomalies:** Deprecated warnings, placeholder 'XXX'.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; code is typical SDK code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (slightly elevated but acceptable).\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to placeholder error mappings and deprecation warnings, but these are common in generated SDK code and do not indicate security risks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The placeholder 'XXX' in error mapping dictionaries is likely an artifact of code generation or incomplete template filling, not malicious.\n- The deprecation warnings are benign and indicate legacy code or ongoing maintenance.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present.\n- The data flows are standard for SDK request builders, with no suspicious network or system activity.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for minor anomalies like placeholders and deprecation warnings, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe SDK implementation with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
