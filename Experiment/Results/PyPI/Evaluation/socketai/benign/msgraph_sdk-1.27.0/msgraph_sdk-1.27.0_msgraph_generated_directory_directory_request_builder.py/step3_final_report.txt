  "purpose": "SDK-style request builder class for managing the 'directory' resource in Microsoft Graph API.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration, path parameters, request data, and user input for constructing requests.",
  "sinks": "RequestInformation objects, network requests via 'send_async', URL construction with parameters.",
  "flows": "Source data flows into request info objects, which are then sent over the network through the request adapter.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder error mapping key 'XXX', deprecation warnings in dataclasses, which are typical artifacts of code generation but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard SDK patterns for request building and execution. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The 'XXX' key in error mapping suggests incomplete or auto-generated code, not malicious intent. Deprecation warnings are benign. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, standard SDK implementation for Microsoft Graph's 'directory' resource. No malicious or obfuscated code identified. Minor anomalies are typical artifacts of code generation and do not pose security risks.",
