  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard SDK pattern for managing 'directory' resource.\n- Sources: Reads configuration, path parameters, user input.\n- Sinks: Request info objects, network requests via 'send_async', URL construction.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns; deprecation warning in config classes is benign.\n- Analysis: No malicious payloads, backdoors, obfuscation, or secrets. Error mapping uses 'XXX' which suggests incomplete code, but not malicious.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard SDK code. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar SDK request builder for 'directory'.\n- Sources: Request data, parameters.\n- Sinks: 'send_async', 'set_content_from_parsable'.\n- Anomalies: 'warn' in deprecated classes; error mapping with 'XXX' key.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior; placeholder in error mapping suggests incomplete or generated code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent; safe SDK pattern. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.1 (slightly elevated due to placeholder and deprecation warnings).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: SDK for 'directory' with get/patch.\n- Sources: Parameters, request content.\n- Sinks: 'send_async'.\n- Anomalies: Deprecated warnings; 'XXX' key in error mapping.\n- Analysis: Standard SDK code, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Safe, typical SDK code. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.2 (again, minor due to placeholders).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources: Parameters, URL, request data.\n- Sinks: 'send_async'.\n- Anomalies: Deprecated warnings; 'XXX' key.\n- Analysis: No malicious patterns; standard request builder.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: SDK for 'directory' resource.\n- Sources: Config, parameters.\n- Sinks: Network requests, serialization.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets; standard patterns; 'XXX' in error mapping.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity; code is typical SDK code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate SDK code. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.2 (due to placeholder).\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected.\n- **Error mapping with 'XXX' key:** Likely placeholder or incomplete code, not malicious.\n- **Deprecation warnings:** Common in generated SDK code, not malicious.\n- **Request handling:** Standard, with no suspicious network activity or data leaks.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or backdoors:** None found.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** Given the placeholder error mapping and deprecation warnings are benign, I would set the overall risk score at **0.2**, reflecting minor concerns about incomplete code artifacts but no real security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, legitimate SDK implementation for Microsoft Graph API. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is evident. The minor anomalies are likely artifacts of code generation or incomplete templates, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Clarify or complete the error mapping to replace 'XXX' with actual error codes.\n- Remove or update deprecated warning classes if possible, but this is not a security concern.\n\n**Final scores:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.2**",
