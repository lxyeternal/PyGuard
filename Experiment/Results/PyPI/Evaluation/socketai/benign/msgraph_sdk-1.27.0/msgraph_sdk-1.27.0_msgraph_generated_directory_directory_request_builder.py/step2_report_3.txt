  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's structure, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as an SDK-like class for managing 'directory' resources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from parameters into request info and network requests; no suspicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns; the only notable aspect is the deprecation warning in a dataclass, which is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears standard, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is high (1). These are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly identifies the code as a request builder.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Request info is sent via `send_async`; no suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** The placeholder 'XXX' in error_mapping is unusual; the deprecation warnings are benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; the placeholder suggests incomplete code or auto-generation artifacts.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Slightly elevated risk due to placeholder, but overall minimal.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, standard SDK request builder.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into request info and network calls.\n- **Anomalies:** Again, 'XXX' in error_mapping; deprecation warnings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; the placeholder is likely incomplete code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Slightly higher risk but still low.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous; standard API client pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses `send_async`, no suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder 'XXX' in error_mapping; deprecation warnings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, standard request builder.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data sent via network requests; no suspicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder 'XXX' in error_mapping; deprecation warnings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; the code is typical SDK code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Slightly elevated due to placeholder but overall low.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is standard SDK pattern code, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to the placeholder 'XXX' in error mapping and deprecation warnings, which are likely artifacts of code generation or incomplete snippets, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The placeholder 'XXX' in error_mapping is a concern but appears to be an incomplete or auto-generated artifact, not malicious.\n- The deprecation warnings are benign but suggest the code might be generated or outdated.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor concern due to placeholder and deprecation warnings, but overall low.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, SDK-style request builder with no malicious or obfuscated content. The minor anomalies are likely artifacts of code generation rather than security issues.",
