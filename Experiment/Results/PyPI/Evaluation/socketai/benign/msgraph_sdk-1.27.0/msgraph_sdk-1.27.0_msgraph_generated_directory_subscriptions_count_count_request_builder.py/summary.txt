  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign SDK component for resource counting. The anomalies are minor and related to configuration placeholders and deprecation warnings, not security threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), primarily due to minor configuration issues. No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious activity are present."
