  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a request builder SDK for Microsoft Graph directory subscriptions, built with standard parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into request info objects and then into network requests via request_adapter.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder error mapping with 'XXX' indicates incomplete error handling; deprecated inner classes emit warnings but are not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to be a typical SDK pattern with no malicious logic. The placeholder error mapping is a minor concern but not security-relevant.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 seem reasonable given the context.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard SDK pattern, no untrusted input sources, and standard request flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Again, 'XXX' in error_mapping, deprecation warnings.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected, just minor artifacts from code generation.\n- **Scores:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the same pattern, with an emphasis on the use of 'XXX' in error_mapping.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder error codes, deprecation warnings.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just incomplete error handling.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar observations: standard SDK pattern, no suspicious code, placeholder error mapping.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK code, low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: request builder for Microsoft Graph, no suspicious activity, placeholder error mapping.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK code.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code being straightforward SDK boilerplate.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0.1 in all cases, justified by placeholder error mappings and deprecated classes, which are typical artifacts of code generation but do not pose security risks.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The placeholder 'XXX' in error_mapping dictionaries should be replaced with actual HTTP status codes (e.g., '404', '500') for completeness, but this does not impact security.\n- Deprecated classes emitting warnings should be updated or removed, but again, this is a maintenance concern, not a security issue.\n- No changes needed to the malware, obfuscated, or risk scores based on the provided analysis.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (minor, due to placeholder error mappings and deprecated classes, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, generated SDK request builder with no malicious or obfuscated content. The minor artifacts do not increase security risk meaningfully.",
