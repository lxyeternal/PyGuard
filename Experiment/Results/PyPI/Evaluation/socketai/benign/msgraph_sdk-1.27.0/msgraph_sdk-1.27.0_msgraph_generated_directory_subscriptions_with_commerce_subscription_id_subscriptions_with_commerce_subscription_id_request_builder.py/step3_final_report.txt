  "purpose": "SDK-like request builder for managing Microsoft Graph directory subscriptions, facilitating CRUD operations via request adapter.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as request_adapter, path_parameters, request configuration objects, and imported modules for request construction.",
  "sinks": "Network requests sent through request_adapter; data flows from input parameters into request info objects and then to external services.",
  "flows": "Parameters and request configurations are used to build RequestInformation objects, which are then executed via request_adapter to perform HTTP operations.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder error mappings ('XXX') indicating incomplete or auto-generated error handling; deprecated classes emitting warnings, but no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard SDK patterns for constructing API requests, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The placeholder error mappings and deprecation warnings are typical artifacts of code generation and do not pose security risks. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The flow of data is straightforward, and the structure aligns with typical request builder implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated SDK component for Microsoft Graph API interactions. It does not contain malicious logic, backdoors, or supply chain security issues. Minor artifacts like placeholder error mappings and deprecated classes are benign and common in generated code.",
