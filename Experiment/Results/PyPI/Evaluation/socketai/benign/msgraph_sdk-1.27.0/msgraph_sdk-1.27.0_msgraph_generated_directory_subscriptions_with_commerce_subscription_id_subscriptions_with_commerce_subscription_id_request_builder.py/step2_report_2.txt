  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes a request builder for Microsoft Graph directory subscriptions. Sources are internal parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from parameters into request info objects, then into network requests.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder error mappings ('XXX') and deprecated inner classes are noted. No malicious code or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK pattern, no malicious behavior. The placeholder error mappings are likely artifacts of code generation, not security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low). The risk score is justified as minimal.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code constructs requests for Microsoft Graph API.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder error mappings ('XXX') and deprecation warnings, but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on request construction with specific parameters.\n- **Anomalies:** Again, placeholder error mapping ('XXX') and deprecated classes, but no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar SDK pattern, with standard request building.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder error mapping ('XXX') and deprecation warnings. No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Slightly lower risk, consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern, typical SDK request builder.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder error mapping ('XXX') and deprecation warnings. No malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Presence of 'XXX' in error_mapping:** Likely a placeholder or incomplete code snippet, not malicious.\n- **Deprecation warnings:** Indicate outdated code but not malicious.\n- **No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.**\n- **Request flows are standard, with no suspicious data exfiltration or code injection.**\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and SDK-like.\n- **Risk score:** Generally low, around 0.1–0.2, justified by the placeholder error mappings and deprecation warnings, which are common in generated SDK code but do not pose security threats.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is standard SDK boilerplate for API interactions, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The minor issues are typical artifacts of code generation and do not impact security.",
