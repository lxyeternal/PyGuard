  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the argparse_addons Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads version from argparse_addons.__version__, reads long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "None.",
  "flows": "Version information from local module, description from file, passed to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, straightforward setup script utilizing setuptools. It imports the local module to access its version, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with standard metadata. No untrusted input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The code structure and content are consistent with benign packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python packaging setup file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
