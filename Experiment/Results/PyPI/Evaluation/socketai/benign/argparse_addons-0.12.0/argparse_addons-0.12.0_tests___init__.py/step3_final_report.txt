  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "No code provided; references to environment variables, input functions, external sources, or standard imports.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows from sources to network or file operations, but no concrete sinks identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs to outputs like network or files; no suspicious flows confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; no obfuscation or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or suspicious activity, assigning appropriate low scores for malware and obfuscation. Confidence levels are generally cautious but justified given the limited information. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and the scores reflect minimal risk. Slight adjustments to confidence scores for reports with no code could improve precision, but overall, the assessments are consistent and reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and low security risk scores around 0.1–0.2. The cautious approach in uncertain cases is justified. Overall, the reports are accurate and well-founded.",
