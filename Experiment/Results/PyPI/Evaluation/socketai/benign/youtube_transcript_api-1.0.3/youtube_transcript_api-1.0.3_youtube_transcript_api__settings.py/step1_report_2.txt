  "purpose": "Constructing a URL template for YouTube videos using a video ID",
  "sources": "The variable 'WATCH_URL' which is assigned a URL string with a placeholder for 'video_id'",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if 'video_id' is obtained from untrusted sources, it could be used to generate malicious or phishing URLs",
  "flows": "Untrusted 'video_id' input → URL string formation via 'WATCH_URL' template",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply defines a URL template without any suspicious or malicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static URL string with a placeholder for 'video_id' to 'WATCH_URL'. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic code execution present. The code alone does not perform any data processing or network activity. The only potential concern is if 'video_id' is used elsewhere from untrusted sources, which is not shown here. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payload, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code merely defines a URL template for YouTube videos. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks in its current form. Its safety depends on how 'video_id' is sourced in the larger application context.",
