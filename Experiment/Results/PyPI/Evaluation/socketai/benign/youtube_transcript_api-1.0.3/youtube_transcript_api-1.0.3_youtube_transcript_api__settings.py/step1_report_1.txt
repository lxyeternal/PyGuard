  "purpose": "Constructing a YouTube watch URL using a variable video ID.",
  "sources": "The code reads the variable 'video_id' (implied) to generate a URL.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if 'video_id' is untrusted, it could be used in malicious contexts such as phishing or URL manipulation.",
  "flows": "Input (video_id) → URL string formation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a URL template with a placeholder for 'video_id'. There is no indication of where 'video_id' is sourced from; if 'video_id' is derived from untrusted input, it could be exploited in URL manipulation. The code itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious logic or obfuscated code. It does not perform any data transmission, system modification, or other malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple URL template construction with no malicious intent. Its security implications depend solely on how 'video_id' is obtained and used elsewhere in the codebase. As-is, it does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
