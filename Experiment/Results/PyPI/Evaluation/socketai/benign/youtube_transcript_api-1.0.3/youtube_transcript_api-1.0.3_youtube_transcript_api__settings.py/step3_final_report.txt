  "purpose": "Define a URL template for YouTube videos with a placeholder for 'video_id'.",
  "sources": "The variable 'video_id' which is intended to be sourced externally or from user input.",
  "sinks": "None within this snippet; potential downstream use of 'video_id' could lead to URL manipulation or phishing if untrusted.",
  "flows": "External source assigns 'video_id' -> URL string construction using the placeholder.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple URL template assigning a string with a placeholder. No functions, input handling, or network activity are present. The security concern hinges on how 'video_id' is sourced externally; if untrusted, it could be manipulated downstream. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident within this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent risk. The code itself is benign, and the potential for misuse depends on external input handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL template with no malicious or obfuscated elements. Security implications depend solely on how 'video_id' is sourced outside this snippet. The assigned scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
