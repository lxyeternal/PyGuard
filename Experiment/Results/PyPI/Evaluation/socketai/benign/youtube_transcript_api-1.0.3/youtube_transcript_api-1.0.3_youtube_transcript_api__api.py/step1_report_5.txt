{
  "purpose": "Provides an API to fetch YouTube video transcripts, including listing available transcripts and retrieving transcript data with optional proxies and cookies.",
  "sources": "Reads cookies from a file in _load_cookie_jar; reads proxy configurations; reads video IDs as input parameters; loads and updates HTTP headers; fetches transcript data via network requests.",
  "sinks": "Uses the requests.Session object to perform network requests; loads cookies into session; may send or receive data over network connections; potentially transmits cookies and proxy data.",
  "flows": "Input video IDs and proxy/cookie configurations are processed to initialize a requests.Session; cookies are loaded from file; network requests made via session in _fetcher_; transcript data fetched and returned.",
  "anomalies": "None of the code performs suspicious or unusual operations; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified; no obfuscated code or hidden logic detected; no code that transmits data to suspicious domains or external entities outside of legitimate requests.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an API client for fetching YouTube transcripts. It loads cookies securely from specified files, supports proxy configurations, and makes network requests using the requests library. Deprecated methods are appropriately warned. No evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or unauthorized system access is present. The logic and flow align with legitimate API wrapper patterns, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The only potential concern could be network-related configurations, but these are standard and controlled via user-supplied parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API wrapper for YouTube transcripts with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly manages input, external data loading, and network requests without suspicious actions. No malware or malicious intent detected.",
