  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper for YouTube transcripts, handling cookies, proxies, and network requests. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity are present. The cookie loading is standard, and deprecation warnings do not imply malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable, given the nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, sabotage, or backdoors detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the API's legitimate purpose, standard handling of cookies and proxies, and absence of suspicious code. Deprecated methods are warnings, not malicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code appears to be a typical API wrapper with configurable network options. No evidence of malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low-risk code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous analyses; standard handling of cookies, proxies, and network requests. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure and legitimate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusions; the code is a typical API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, malware, or backdoors. The consistent malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report; all scores are 0.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are uniformly low (0.2), reflecting the code's nature as an API wrapper with configurable network parameters. While it handles potentially sensitive data (cookies, proxies), these are managed securely and with standard practices.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no signs of malware or sabotage.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper for fetching YouTube transcripts, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score is appropriate given its functionality and handling of user data.",
