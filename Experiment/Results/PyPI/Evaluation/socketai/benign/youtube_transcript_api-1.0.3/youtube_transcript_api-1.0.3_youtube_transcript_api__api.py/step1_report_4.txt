  "purpose": "This code implements a Python API client for fetching YouTube video transcripts, supporting proxy configuration, cookie management, and transcript retrieval features.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-provided cookie file paths, proxy configuration objects or dictionaries, and video IDs provided to class methods and functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests made via the `requests` Session object, specifically during transcript fetching, and loading cookies from files. No direct data leaks or dangerous actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (cookie path, proxies, video IDs) into cookie loading functions, configuration objects, and network request methods. The flow is straightforward: input data -> configuration -> network request -> transcript data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code. No unusual dynamic code execution or data exfiltration activities are present. Use of warnings and standard library functions appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an API interface for retrieving YouTube transcripts, utilizing standard Python libraries (`requests`, `pathlib`, `warnings`) and third-party modules for cookies and proxy management. The cookie loading process involves reading a cookie file, raising exceptions if invalid, which is standard. Proxy configuration is handled via provided objects or dictionaries, with no evident malicious manipulations. All network requests are made via the `requests.Session` object, with headers and proxies set appropriately. The deprecated class methods suggest backward compatibility without introducing suspicious behavior. No code segments perform data exfiltration, execute arbitrary code, or access sensitive environment variables. Overall, the code appears to perform its stated function securely without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client for YouTube transcripts, with proper handling of cookies, proxies, and network requests. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
