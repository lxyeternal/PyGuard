{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API for retrieving YouTube video transcripts, handling cookies, proxies, and network requests.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters, environment (cookies file path), and possibly external proxy configurations.",
  "sinks": "Network requests made via requests.Session, potential data leaks if cookies or proxies are maliciously controlled, loading cookies from file.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (video ID, cookies, proxies) flow into network request setup and data retrieval functions; cookie loading and proxy configuration influence request behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code. Use of deprecated methods emitting warnings but not malicious. No unusual code constructs or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an HTTP session, loads cookies from a specified file, and configures proxies if provided. Network requests are made via requests.Session, with headers updated and optional connection closure. The class offers methods to list and fetch transcripts for YouTube videos, with several deprecated methods warning about future removal. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious network connections. The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper with standard practices for network configuration and data handling. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API wrapper for YouTube transcripts with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It responsibly manages cookies and proxies and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, it poses low security risk.",
