  "purpose": "Provides an API for fetching YouTube video transcripts, including methods to list available transcripts and retrieve transcript data, with support for proxies, cookies, and language preferences.",
  "sources": "File system for reading cookie files; network requests via requests.Session; input parameters such as video IDs, proxies, cookies, and language lists.",
  "sinks": "Network requests made through requests.Session; loading cookies from files; passing untrusted input to network requests; warnings for deprecated functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like cookie_path, proxies, and video_id are used to configure network requests; fetch methods generate transcript data via network calls based on video_id and language preferences.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated methods with warnings; flexible handling of proxies and cookies, which is standard; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code or malicious URL usage.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a requests.Session with configurable proxies and cookies, used to fetch transcript data for YouTube videos. The cookie loading process reads from file paths, raising exceptions if invalid, which is standard. Proxy configurations are optional and flexible. The code contains multiple deprecated methods with warnings, indicating ongoing maintenance but not malicious intent. There are no signs of hidden backdoors, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration. The use of warnings and flexible configuration parameters aligns with typical API design, not malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper for fetching YouTube transcripts, with configurable network and authentication options. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The presence of deprecated methods suggests ongoing updates but does not indicate malicious intent.",
