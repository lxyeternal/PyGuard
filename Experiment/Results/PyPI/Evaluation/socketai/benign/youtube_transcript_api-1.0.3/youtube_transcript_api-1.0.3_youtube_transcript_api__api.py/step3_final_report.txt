  "purpose": "A Python API client for fetching YouTube video transcripts, handling cookies, proxies, and network requests in a configurable manner.",
  "sources": "File input for cookies, user-provided proxies, video ID parameters, network request functions within the requests.Session object.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to YouTube servers, cookie loading, proxy configurations, user-controlled video IDs and cookies.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (video ID, cookies, proxies) flow into network request setup, which then fetches transcript data from YouTube, returning structured transcript objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, suspicious URL patterns, or malicious network activity detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clear, well-structured API wrapper for retrieving YouTube transcripts, with standard cookie and proxy handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Network interactions are controlled via user inputs, and deprecated methods emit warnings but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the code's functionality and potential attack surface, which is minimal and typical for such an API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent API client with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score accurately reflects its safe nature, with minor considerations for user-controlled network configurations. Overall, it poses minimal security concerns.",
