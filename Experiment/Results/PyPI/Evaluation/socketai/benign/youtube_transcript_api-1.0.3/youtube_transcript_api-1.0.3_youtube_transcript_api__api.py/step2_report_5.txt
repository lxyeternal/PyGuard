  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking their conclusions with the code and considering the scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward API wrapper for YouTube transcripts.\n- No mention of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The code handles cookies, proxies, and network requests in a standard, transparent manner.\n- Deprecated methods emit warnings but do not introduce malicious behavior.\n- No suspicious URL usage, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n- The network interactions are typical and controlled via user inputs.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis:\n\n#### Malware Score Justification:\n- All reports assign a malware score of **0**.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions: no data exfiltration, no code injection, no suspicious network activity.\n- Cookie and proxy handling are standard; no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of **0**.\n- The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries.\n- No obfuscation or cryptic code patterns are present.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score of 0 is justified.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- All reports assign a low security risk of **0.2**.\n- The code involves user-supplied cookies and proxies, which could be misused if maliciously configured.\n- However, this is a typical risk for network-related code, not an indication of malicious activity.\n- No vulnerabilities or exploits are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- The code's logic and flow do not suggest any malicious or sabotage intent.\n- The deprecation warnings are standard and do not imply malicious behavior.\n- The overall assessment should remain: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (standard network handling with user inputs; low risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, transparent API wrapper for YouTube transcripts with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
