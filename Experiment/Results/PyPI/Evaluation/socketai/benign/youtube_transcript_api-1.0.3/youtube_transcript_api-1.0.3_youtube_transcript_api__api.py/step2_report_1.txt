  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper for YouTube transcripts. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity. Cookie loading is standard, network requests are made via requests.Session, and no backdoors or data leaks are detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable given the benign nature, but a slightly elevated risk score might be justified due to external network requests and user-controlled inputs.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on flexible proxy and cookie handling, deprecated methods, and no malicious activity. The code appears legitimate, with no signs of sabotage.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, standard API wrapper behavior, no suspicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation. Network activity is user-controlled via parameters.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same conclusion; code is a typical API client with secure cookie and proxy handling, no malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with others; no malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and there is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code is a standard API wrapper, with network requests and cookie handling, but nothing malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The highest risk factor is the network request capability and user-controlled inputs (cookies, proxies, video IDs). While these are standard for such an API, they could be exploited if misused. The current scores of 0.2 are reasonable; however, considering the external network dependencies and user inputs, a slightly higher score (e.g., 0.3) might better reflect potential misuse in a supply chain attack context.\n\n- **Purpose & Flows:** The code's purpose is clear, with straightforward data flow. No anomalies or suspicious logic are detected.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Based on the detailed analysis, **there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage**. The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for YouTube transcripts.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2–0.3 (current 0.2 is acceptable, but a slight increase to 0.3 could better reflect potential attack surface)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2–0.3|\n\n**Overall, I agree with the current malware and obfuscated scores. The risk score is slightly conservative; I would suggest increasing it marginally to 0.3 to account for network exposure and user-controlled inputs, but 0.2 remains reasonable.**",
