  "purpose": "This code provides an API to retrieve YouTube video transcripts, handling cookies, proxies, and network requests.",
  "sources": "User inputs include cookie file paths (`cookie_path`), video IDs (`video_id`), and optional proxies (`proxy_config`, `proxies`). External data sources include cookie files and network requests to YouTube via the `requests.Session` object.",
  "sinks": "Network requests made through the `requests.Session` object, especially in `TranscriptListFetcher`. Potential data leakage could occur if cookies or proxies are maliciously configured. No explicit data leaks or malicious data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "User supplies cookie paths or proxies → `_load_cookie_jar` loads cookies → `http_client` configured with cookies and proxies → network requests fetch transcript data → data returned to user.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, cryptic variables, or dynamic code execution. Usage of deprecated methods (`list_transcripts`, `get_transcripts`, `get_transcript`) warns about future removals but does not introduce malicious behavior. No backdoors or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes HTTP sessions with user-provided cookies and proxy configurations, then performs network requests to retrieve transcripts. The `_load_cookie_jar` function loads cookies securely from specified paths. The class methods handle fetching transcript data, with deprecation warnings indicating evolution of the API. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden malicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper with standard network handling, not exhibiting any malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API wrapper designed for retrieving YouTube transcripts, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles user inputs and network requests securely, with no evidence of malware, data leaks, or backdoors. The deprecation warnings suggest ongoing development but do not impact security.",
