  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \n- It provides an API for fetching YouTube transcripts, handling cookies, proxies, and network requests.  \n- It loads cookies from specified files, configures an HTTP session, and performs network requests to retrieve transcript data.  \n- It includes deprecated methods, warnings, and standard network handling.  \n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are evident.  \n- The code appears to be a typical API wrapper with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** API to retrieve transcripts; handles cookies, proxies, network requests.  \n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity. The cookie loader is straightforward.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate API wrapper, no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (low, due to configuration flexibility)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 (reasonable)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** API for fetching transcripts, with support for proxies, cookies, and language preferences.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation. Deprecated methods emit warnings but do not imply malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Code appears legitimate, standard network handling.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** API for retrieving transcripts, handling cookies, proxies, network requests.  \n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code. The cookie loading and proxy handling are standard.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low risk.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** API client for fetching transcripts, supporting proxy and cookie management.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no data exfiltration, no backdoors. Use of standard libraries and practices.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** API for fetching transcripts, with cookie and proxy handling.  \n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, no suspicious operations, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate API wrapper, low security risk.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the clear, straightforward code.  \n- **Security risk score:** Set at 0.2 across all reports, reflecting standard configuration flexibility without evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Are any scores unreasonable?**  \nNo. All scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code or activity)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to configuration options but no actual vulnerabilities)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' scores are reasonable and accurately reflect the code's security posture. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward API wrapper for YouTube transcripts, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scoring aligns well with the analysis.",
