{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for configuring proxies, including generic and Webshare-specific rotating proxies, providing methods to generate proxy URLs with embedded credentials and dictionaries compatible with the requests library.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters such as proxy URLs, usernames, passwords, and configuration options within class constructors and properties.",
  "sinks": "The constructed proxy URL strings and dictionaries used by the requests library to route HTTP/HTTPS traffic through specified proxies.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (credentials, URLs) flow into URL construction methods, which embed credentials into URLs, then into the `to_requests_dict()` method, producing configuration dicts for network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected. URL embedding of credentials is standard in proxy configs but warrants caution outside this context.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a clear, standard implementation of proxy configuration classes. It handles user input for proxy URLs and credentials, constructs URLs with embedded credentials, and outputs configuration dictionaries for the requests library. No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The potential security concern is the handling of credentials, which is typical in proxy setups but should be managed securely outside this code. The code's logic is straightforward, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of proxy configuration classes, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware. The handling of user credentials is standard practice, and the overall security risk is minimal. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2 to reflect the inherent sensitivity of credential handling but no malicious activity.",
