{
  "purpose": "Define proxy configuration classes for use with the requests library, including generic and Webshare-specific rotating proxies.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, property methods, and the to_requests_dict method that generate proxy URLs based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The to_requests_dict method outputs proxy URLs; the url property constructs proxy URLs with embedded credentials.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy credentials and configuration) flow into URL construction within properties and methods, which produce proxy dicts or URLs for network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data; proxy URL construction uses user-supplied inputs. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns detected. No external network calls or data leaks evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes to configure HTTP/HTTPS proxies, including rotating residential proxies with user credentials. It performs input validation, constructs URLs with embedded credentials, and returns configuration dictionaries compatible with the requests library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or unsafe code patterns. The only potential concern is the handling of user-provided proxy credentials, but this is standard practice and not malicious. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or hidden functions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of proxy configuration classes for legitimate use. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malware are detected. It primarily constructs proxy URLs and dictionaries based on user inputs, with no indications of security risks or malicious behavior.",
