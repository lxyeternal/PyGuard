  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe classes that configure proxies, including Webshare-specific rotating proxies.\n- The code constructs proxy URLs with embedded credentials and returns dictionaries compatible with the requests library.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present.\n- The primary concern relates to handling user-supplied credentials, which is standard practice but requires careful handling to avoid leaks.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the descriptions: classes for proxy configs, URL construction, and dictionary output.\n- No issues are present in the code logic or implementation.\n- The URL construction embeds user credentials as expected.\n- No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Issues in reports:\n- **No factual inaccuracies** or logical flaws are identified in any of the reports.\n- The reports correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious network behavior.\n- The concern about handling user credentials is valid but not malicious per se.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the inherent risk of handling user credentials, which is reasonable.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Risk justification:\n- Since the code only constructs proxy URLs and dictionaries, with no malicious payloads or network activity, a **risk score of around 0.1-0.2** is appropriate.\n- The potential risk is mainly if user credentials are compromised or misused outside this code, but that is external to the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, due to handling of sensitive info but no malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of proxy configuration classes. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present. The handling of user credentials is standard and not inherently risky in this context.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware score at **0**.\n- Keep obfuscated score at **0**.\n- Set security risk score at **0.1** to reflect minimal inherent risk.\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
