{
  "purpose": "This code defines various formatter classes for converting transcript data into different formats such as JSON, pretty-printed text, SRT, and WebVTT, primarily for presentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads transcript data from instances of FetchedTranscript and FetchedTranscriptSnippet via the to_raw_data() method, as well as from class attributes like 'start', 'duration', and 'text' within transcript and snippet objects.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted transcript strings via methods like json.dumps() and pprint.pformat(), which generate text but do not execute or evaluate untrusted input. No direct sinks for data leaks, network communication, or code execution are present.",
  "flows": "Transcript objects are converted into raw data through to_raw_data(), then passed to formatting methods that generate string outputs; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code uses standard formatting libraries and simple data transformations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple formatter classes that convert transcript data into various formats. It accesses transcript data via safe methods like to_raw_data() and attribute access. No execution of dynamic code, input evaluation, or network operations occurs. The only external library used is standard Python modules (json and pprint). The class structure includes error handling for unsupported formatter types. Overall, the code appears purely for data formatting with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, standard formatters for transcript data, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to convert data into display-friendly formats without executing or transmitting untrusted data. The malware score is low, and the security risk is minimal.",
