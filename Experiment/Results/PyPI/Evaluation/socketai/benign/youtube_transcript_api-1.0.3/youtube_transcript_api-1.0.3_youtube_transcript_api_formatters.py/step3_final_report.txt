{
  "purpose": "The code provides various formatters for transcript data, converting transcript objects into different string formats such as JSON, pretty-printed, plain text, SRT, and WebVTT.",
  "sources": "Reads data from FetchedTranscript objects via to_raw_data() method and transcript line attributes (start, duration, text).",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted strings via json.dumps(), pprint.pformat(), string joins, and string formatting functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal transcript objects through formatting functions to output strings; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely handles data serialization and formatting using standard Python libraries. It accesses transcript data via trusted methods and outputs formatted strings without executing external code or network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of straightforward data access and serialization functions indicates benign utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of transcript formatters with no malicious intent or security risks. The current malware score of 0.0, obfuscation score of 0.0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
