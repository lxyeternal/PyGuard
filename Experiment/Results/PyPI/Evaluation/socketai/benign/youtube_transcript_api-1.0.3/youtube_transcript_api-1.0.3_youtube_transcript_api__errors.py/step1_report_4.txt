{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions and error handling for the YouTube transcript API, including error messages for various failure scenarios such as invalid cookies, request failures, age restrictions, and unavailability of transcripts.",
  "sources": "Imports from requests, pathlib, and internal modules (_settings, proxies); uses class initializers and property methods that generate error messages.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising and message formatting; no direct sinks involved in data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation triggers message construction; no untrusted data flow leading to code execution or data leaks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code primarily creates descriptive exception classes with message templates.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for various error conditions in the YouTube transcript API. The classes generate detailed error messages, some incorporating dynamic data such as video IDs and request causes. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity. No external network requests or system modifications are performed within this snippet. The structure and behavior are consistent with standard error handling, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in a YouTube transcript API. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain threats. It primarily serves as an organized way to handle and report errors, with no security risks identified.",
