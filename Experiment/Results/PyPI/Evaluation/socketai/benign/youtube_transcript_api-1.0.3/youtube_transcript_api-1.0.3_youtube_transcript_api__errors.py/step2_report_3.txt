  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines custom exceptions for error handling.\n- Sources: Constants, class initializers, properties, message formatting.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Purely exception classes, no network or data processing.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining error classes.\n- Sources: Standard modules, no external data reading.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior, no secrets.\n- Analysis: Exception classes, no active data flows.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious code.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes with some configuration-based messages.\n- Sources: Reads configuration values, proxies.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Exception classes with formatted messages; no active network or data processing.\n- Security Risk: Slightly above zero (0.1), possibly due to inclusion of configuration info, but still benign.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, only error handling.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Defines error classes for various failure scenarios.\n- Sources: Imports, message templates.\n- Anomalies: No secrets or suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Standard exception classes, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar to previous, exception classes for errors.\n- Sources: Static strings, input parameters.\n- Anomalies: No secrets, no obfuscated or malicious code.\n- Analysis: Exception classes with controlled message formatting.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is a set of exception classes for error handling in a YouTube transcript API client.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None detected. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no code obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Potential Risks:** Slight mention of security risk (0.1) in one report due to message content, but this is negligible and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is purely structural, defining exception classes with detailed messages for various error conditions. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The messages are constructed from static templates and controlled parameters like video IDs or proxy configurations, which do not pose security threats.\n\n**Based on the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments.** The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive review and the nature of the code.",
