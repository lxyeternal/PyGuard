  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is purely exception class definitions with detailed messages, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, standard error handling classes. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, only exception classes with message formatting, no malicious activity or data leaks.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** Safe, straightforward exception definitions.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Exception classes with dynamic message content, no network calls or data processing, no obfuscation, no secrets.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero, but likely due to the potential for message injection if untrusted data were used, which it isn't here).  \n- **Assessment:** Still safe; minor note on message formatting but no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—exception classes with message templates, no malicious activity.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.0  \n- **Assessment:** Completely safe.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Exception classes with static and controlled message formatting, no network or data processing, no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports confirm that the code consists solely of exception class definitions for error handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n- The only slight concern in one report is a minimal security risk score (0.1), likely due to message formatting, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No indication of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0. All code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (error classes only), the risk remains negligible, around 0.0 to 0.1.\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a set of well-structured exception classes for error handling in a YouTube transcript API. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal risk score in one report is likely an overestimation due to message formatting, but it does not reflect any actual threat.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements.",
