{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of custom exception classes for error handling in the YouTube transcript API, providing detailed error messages for various failure scenarios.",
  "sources": "Constants such as WATCH_URL, class initializers, and message formatting parameters (video IDs, proxy configs, error causes).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; error messages are constructed from controlled parameters. No network or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (video IDs, error causes, proxy configurations) flow into message templates within exception classes, but no external data or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution. Message formatting uses controlled inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions used for error reporting. It includes no network calls, data processing, or malicious payloads. The message templates are static or incorporate controlled parameters like video IDs and proxy configs. No obfuscation or secrets are present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in one report is justified by the potential for message content to include user data, but this does not constitute a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of exception classes for a YouTube transcript API. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, error-handling nature.",
