  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling errors related to YouTube transcript retrieval and related processes.",
  "sources": "Constants and imported modules; class initializers; properties; exception message formatting.",
  "sinks": "Error message construction and string formatting operations.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised with specific messages; messages may include dynamic data such as video IDs or error causes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. Exception classes contain detailed user guidance but do not perform suspicious operations. No data leaks or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists primarily of custom exception classes designed for error handling in a YouTube transcript API context. It includes detailed error messages and support for proxy configurations. The code performs string formatting for messages but does not include data processing, network calls, or data handling that could be malicious. The only dynamic aspect involves constructing error messages with contextual info, which is typical for exception classes. No indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured set of exception classes used for handling various errors related to YouTube transcript retrieval. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It primarily provides informative error messaging and configuration support. Therefore, it poses no security threat.",
