{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling various errors related to retrieving YouTube transcripts, including authentication issues, request failures, and content restrictions.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration values (e.g., WATCH_URL), and potentially user-provided video IDs or proxies (via ProxyConfig).",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions with formatted error messages; no direct data sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "User inputs such as video IDs and proxy configurations flow into exception handling, but there is no evidence of untrusted data being used in a way that could cause code injection or malicious effects.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code mainly defines exception classes with formatted messages, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable naming is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of custom exception class definitions used for error handling in a YouTube transcript retrieval API. These classes format and produce error messages based on input data like video IDs and proxy configurations. No functions perform network requests, data processing, or any operations that could be exploited for malicious purposes. All data used in message formatting appears to be controlled or sanitized, with no signs of hardcoded secrets, code injection, or malicious payloads. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard error handling patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network operations, data manipulation, or dynamic code execution that could be exploited. There are no anomalies indicating supply chain sabotage or malware. Overall, the code is safe.",
