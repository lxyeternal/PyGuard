  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, evaluate the reasoning, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of custom exception classes for handling errors in a YouTube transcript API. No suspicious or malicious code detected; primarily error message formatting.\n\n- **Analysis:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is purely for error handling and messaging.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **reasonable.**\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on exception class definitions. No external data processing or network activity.\n\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation. Standard exception classes.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes that incorporate dynamic data like video IDs and proxy configs into messages. No network or data processing.\n\n- **Analysis:** The only potential concern is the securityRisk score set to 0.1, which is slightly above zero. However, the report notes that the code only formats messages with controlled data; no secrets or malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — **acceptable, given the slight non-zero risk score.**\n\n**Conclusion:** The risk score is marginally above zero but justified due to potential for message content containing user data, though not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with detailed exception classes. No network activity or data leaks.\n\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with message formatting, no network or data processing.\n\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent or suspicious activity. The code is purely for error reporting.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malware presence, with scores at 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are at 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly at 0, with one at 0.1, justified by the potential for error messages to include user data, but no actual security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final justification:\n\n- **Malware:** The code contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** The minimal risk score (0.1) in one report is justified by the potential for error messages to include sensitive data, but since the code only formats messages with controlled data, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0 (or at most 0.1 if considering message content, but justified as is)\n\n**Overall:** The code is safe, well-structured, and poses no security threat.",
