{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various errors related to retrieving YouTube transcripts, including authentication issues, request failures, and content restrictions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules (pathlib, typing, requests) and internal modules (_settings, proxies). No user input or external data reading is explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "String formatting in error messages, exception raising, and class property methods.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no active data flows or untrusted data processing in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code only defines exception classes and message handling. No network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution mechanisms are implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions for handling specific errors related to YouTube transcript retrieval. It includes detailed error messages and context-specific causes, but no code that reads input or processes external data dynamically. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or data leakage mechanisms. Import statements are standard, and no insecure practices like hardcoded secrets or unsafe data handling are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for error handling in a YouTube transcript API. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely manages error messages and exceptions, with no active data flows or network activities. Overall, it is safe and free from malicious intent.",
