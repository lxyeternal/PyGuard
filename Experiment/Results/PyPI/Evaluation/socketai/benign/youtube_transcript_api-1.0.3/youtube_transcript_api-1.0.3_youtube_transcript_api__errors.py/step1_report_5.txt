{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and error handling for a YouTube transcript API, including handling various failure scenarios such as request failures, age restrictions, and invalid video IDs.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class attributes, exception instantiation parameters (e.g., video_id, cookie_path), and external constants like WATCH_URL.",
  "sinks": "Error message construction and exception raising, which could potentially output sensitive data if error messages include untrusted input (though in this case, only controlled data like video IDs and predefined strings are used).",
  "flows": "Input data such as video_id or error details flow into exception constructors and are incorporated into error messages for reporting purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior or obfuscation is present. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or malicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely comprises exception class definitions and message formatting. There are no functions that perform network requests, data processing, or untrusted data handling beyond message formatting. All exception classes include static messages or incorporate parameters in a controlled manner. The import statements reference standard libraries and some external modules but do not involve code that can be malicious by itself. No indications of hidden backdoors, malicious data exfiltration, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code serves as structured error handling for a YouTube transcript API client. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious activities, or security risks. It mainly focuses on exception management and informative error messages. Based on the current review, there is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
