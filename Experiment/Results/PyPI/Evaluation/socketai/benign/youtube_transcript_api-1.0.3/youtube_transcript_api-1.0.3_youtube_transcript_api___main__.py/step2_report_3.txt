  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI entry point that imports a local module `_cli`, initializes logging, and runs a command-line interface class with arguments.\n- There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code itself is straightforward and appears benign.\n- The primary concern is the imported module `YouTubeTranscriptCli`, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Code correctness:**  \n  The code correctly initializes logging, processes command-line arguments, and calls the `run()` method of the CLI class, then prints its output. No issues here.\n\n- **Malicious behavior:**  \n  The code does not contain any network calls, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated patterns.  \n  The only potential risk is in the imported `_cli` module, which could contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from the snippet.\n\n- **Use of local module:**  \n  The module `_cli` could be benign or malicious, but no malicious behavior is evident here.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard CLI launcher, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- They note that the core functionality depends on `YouTubeTranscriptCli`, which is outside this code snippet.\n- The confidence scores are high (0.8-0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious patterns in this code.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Since the actual implementation of `YouTubeTranscriptCli` is unknown, the security assessment cannot be fully complete.\n- However, based solely on this code, there are no indicators of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Malware:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code snippet.\n\n- **Security risk:**  \n  Slight variation (0.1-0.2). Given the lack of suspicious code here, these are acceptable. The actual risk hinges on the external module.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- The scores are reasonable; no higher risk scores are warranted based on this code alone.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1-0.2 (acceptable, considering external module dependency)\n\n- **Additional considerations:**  \n  - The main concern is the imported module `_cli`. If possible, review its implementation for malicious behavior, especially if sourced from untrusted origins.\n  - The code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard CLI launcher with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The risk score is low, contingent on the security of the external `_cli` module.\n- The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the code analysis.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1-0.2 |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.",
