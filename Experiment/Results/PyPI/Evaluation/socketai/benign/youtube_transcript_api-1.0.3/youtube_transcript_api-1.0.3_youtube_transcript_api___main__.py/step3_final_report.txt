  "purpose": "Initialize logging, process command-line arguments, and execute the run() method of YouTubeTranscriptCli to produce output.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:] (command-line arguments)",
  "sinks": "The run() method of YouTubeTranscriptCli (potentially processing untrusted data)",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments → YouTubeTranscriptCli instance → run() method → print output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI entry point that imports sys and logging, initializes logging, creates an instance of YouTubeTranscriptCli with command-line arguments, and prints the result of its run() method. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of YouTubeTranscriptCli, which is external. The code itself is straightforward and typical for CLI applications, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions as a standard CLI launcher. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external module. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores are consistent with this assessment, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2).",
