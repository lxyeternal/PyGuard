  "purpose": "To initialize and run a command-line interface (CLI) for YouTube transcript processing.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:] (command-line arguments), import of YouTubeTranscriptCli from local module",
  "sinks": "Run method of YouTubeTranscriptCli, print statement",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] → YouTubeTranscriptCli.run() → print output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed; use of local module could be benign or malicious, but no specific malicious behavior detected here.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up basic logging, then instantiates a CLI class with command-line arguments, runs it, and prints the output. The only potentially risky element is reliance on an external or local module (_cli) which could contain malicious code, but that cannot be assessed here. The code structure itself appears standard for a CLI entry point. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are evident. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any dangerous operations directly.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard CLI entry point with no apparent malicious behavior or security issues. The risk depends on the implementation of YouTubeTranscriptCli, which is outside this code snippet. Overall, no malicious intent is detectable from this code alone.",
