  "purpose": "To initialize and run a command-line interface (CLI) for YouTube transcript processing.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Prints the output of the CLI run to standard output",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] -> YouTubeTranscriptCli.run() -> print()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code relies on an external module '_cli' which is not provided but appears to handle core functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and logging, sets up basic logging configuration, and executes a CLI command via YouTubeTranscriptCli with command-line arguments. The output is printed to standard output. There are no suspicious behaviors, no data leaks, or malicious patterns evident in this snippet. It appears to be a straightforward CLI launcher.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The external '_cli' module's security posture cannot be assessed from this code alone, but the code here itself is benign.",
