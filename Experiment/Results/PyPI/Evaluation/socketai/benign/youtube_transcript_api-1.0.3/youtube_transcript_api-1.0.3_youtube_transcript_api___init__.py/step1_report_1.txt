{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package for interacting with YouTube transcripts, providing classes and exception handling for transcript retrieval and error management.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading internal modules and classes related to YouTube transcript API, transcript data, and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code primarily defines imports and does not include data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed within this snippet; it is solely importing classes and exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or malicious activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import structure for a Python package. It imports classes related to YouTube transcript data and exception handling from internal modules. There are no input/output operations, no external network calls, nor any processing logic that could pose security risks. The presence of noqa comment suggests awareness of code quality or unused imports, not malicious intent. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are evident. The package appears designed for legitimate transcript retrieval functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard import module for a Python YouTube transcript API package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It serves as a foundational setup for other parts of the package to operate securely.",
