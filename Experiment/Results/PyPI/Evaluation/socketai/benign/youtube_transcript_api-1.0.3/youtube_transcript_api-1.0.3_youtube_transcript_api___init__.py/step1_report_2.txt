{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that provides an API for interacting with YouTube transcripts, including fetching transcripts and handling related errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load classes and exceptions from internal modules (_api, _transcripts, _errors). No external input handling is visible in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present in this code snippet; it is only import statements without data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink can be determined here, as this snippet contains only module imports and no executable logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The import statements are straightforward and standard for a package structure.",
  "analysis": "This code is solely composed of import statements importing classes and exceptions from internal modules. There is no executable code, data processing, or network activity. The imported modules likely contain the core logic, but based on this snippet alone, there is no indication of malicious activity or security risks. The structure is typical for a Python package that encapsulates functionality related to YouTube transcripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard set of import statements for a Python package and does not contain any malicious code, security risks, or obfuscated content. It appears safe based on this limited view.",
