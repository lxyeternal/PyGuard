  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements of internal modules/classes related to YouTube transcript handling.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or network activity is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be part of a standard Python package structure, focusing on importing classes and exceptions for later use.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as import statements for transcript classes and exceptions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no anomalies, straightforward import structure.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (simple imports with no execution or data handling), a low risk score (around 0.0 to 0.1) is appropriate.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable. No report overstates the risk.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should be very low, around 0.0 to 0.1, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Justification:** The code snippet is purely structural, serving as a module import setup. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments that the code is safe, non-malicious, and free from obfuscation or security risks. The scores should remain at or near zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low risk score.",
