  "purpose": "Import statements for YouTube transcript API classes and exceptions, serving as foundational module setup.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports (_api, _transcripts, _errors).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Import statements load classes/exceptions into namespace; no runtime data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for classes and exceptions related to YouTube transcript handling. There are no executable functions, data processing, network calls, or external inputs. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Given the lack of executable logic or external interactions, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign import module with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
