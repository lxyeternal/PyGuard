{
  "purpose": "The code is importing various classes and exceptions related to YouTube transcript retrieval and handling, likely as part of a larger API or SDK module.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from internal module files such as ._api, ._transcripts, and ._errors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only imports classes and exceptions without executing or handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A – The code only defines imports; there are no data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, importing classes and exception definitions from internal modules. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or other executable logic that could introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. Import statements alone are a standard practice for modular code organization and do not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of import statements for classes and exceptions related to YouTube transcript handling. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be part of a well-structured module focused on API interactions and error management.",
