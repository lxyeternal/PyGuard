  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is just import statements for classes and exceptions.\n- No data flow, no network activity, no suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n- The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the absence of data handling or external communication.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: straightforward imports, no malicious activity.\n- No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n- The reasoning is solid.\n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, only import statements, no dynamic or external operations.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n- The reasoning is appropriate.\n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis: imports only, no data flow or external interactions.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.\n- The reasoning holds.\n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely import statements with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are also correctly assigned as 0.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward import structure.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- Based on the code snippet and reports, I concur with the given scores.\n- The code is standard, benign, and does not pose security risks.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and no further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
