  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a set of import statements from internal modules, importing classes and exceptions related to YouTube transcript handling.\n   - There are no executable functions, data processing, network calls, or external inputs.\n   - The code appears to be a foundational part of a larger package, not performing any malicious or suspicious operations itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment: they correctly identify that the code is just import statements with no malicious activity.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation detected.\n   - The reports' conclusions are consistent with the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is only import statements with no executable or network activity, there is no basis for a high risk score.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious behavior is suggested or implied by the code.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and do not assume malicious intent; they base their conclusions on the code's content.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analyses provided.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign import module for a Python package related to YouTube transcripts. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on this analysis, I agree with the provided scores. The code is safe, with no malicious or security concerns.",
