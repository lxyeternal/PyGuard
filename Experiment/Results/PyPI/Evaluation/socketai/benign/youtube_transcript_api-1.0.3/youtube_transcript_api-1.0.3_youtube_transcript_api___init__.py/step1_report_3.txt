{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import specific classes and exceptions related to YouTube transcript handling and errors from internal modules, likely for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_api, _transcripts, _errors) that define classes and exceptions used elsewhere in the project.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not include any sinks that process untrusted data; it merely imports classes and exceptions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this snippet; the code only sets up imports for later use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which are standard in Python projects to include classes and exceptions for use elsewhere. There is no dynamic execution, user input handling, or network activity. It appears to be part of a package that interfaces with YouTube transcript data, with comprehensive exception handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import section of a Python module, importing classes and exceptions for handling YouTube transcripts and related errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
