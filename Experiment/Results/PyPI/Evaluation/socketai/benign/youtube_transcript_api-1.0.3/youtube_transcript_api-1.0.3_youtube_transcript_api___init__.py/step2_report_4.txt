  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is purely import statements from internal modules, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is just import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  **No.** The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward import statements.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0 or very low, which is justified given the absence of executable or risky behavior.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- None of the reports suggest any activity that warrants a risk score above 0.5. The code is purely structural, serving as part of a package.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly challenge any assumptions that import statements could be malicious; they are standard practice.\n- No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious imports are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and free of security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The reasoning is sound and aligns with best practices.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard import module, serving as a foundation for a larger API, with no malicious or security concern evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
