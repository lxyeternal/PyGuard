  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface for fetching and formatting YouTube video transcripts, supporting proxies, translation, and filtering options.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments, including video IDs, proxy settings, and translation options.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to YouTube API, proxy servers, and potential file reads for cookies.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> parsed and sanitized -> used to configure API requests and proxies -> network requests to YouTube API -> transcripts processed and formatted -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. Proxy configuration is flexible but not suspicious. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected. The use of external API calls is standard for such tools. The code handles exceptions, but no sensitive data is directly exposed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper for a YouTube transcript API. It sanitizes inputs, handles proxy configuration, and manages transcript retrieval and formatting. No suspicious network behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated or malicious code segments. Proxy credentials are accepted via command-line arguments, which is typical for configurable network tools but could pose a risk if sensitive data is leaked through logs or unintended channels; however, no such leaks are evident here. The code’s functionality aligns with its purpose without evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and focused on fetching and formatting YouTube transcripts. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this module. Proxy configurations and API interactions are typical for such tools. Overall security risk is low.",
