  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a CLI for fetching transcripts, based on user input.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Input is used to configure API and proxies; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. Proxy configuration and argument parsing are standard. No signs of malicious activity. The low risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on user-supplied proxy URLs and credentials.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Data flows into network requests; no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. Proxy credentials are user-provided, typical for such tools.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose; user inputs for proxies, video IDs, etc.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Inputs flow into API calls; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; proxy credentials are user-supplied.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low risk score remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on input arguments and their flow into API calls.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No code injection or malicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; user input is used for configuration only.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description; input from command-line arguments.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors; standard API request setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity or malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues identified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. The code is a CLI wrapper that handles user input and API calls without any malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0.2, indicating low security risk. This is reasonable given the code's functionality—accepting user input for proxies, credentials, etc.—which is standard for such tools. No dangerous behaviors are evident.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — Slight risk due to reliance on user input for sensitive configurations (proxies, cookies), but this is typical and does not constitute a significant security concern.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided scores.** The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified, considering the nature of the application.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's functionality.",
