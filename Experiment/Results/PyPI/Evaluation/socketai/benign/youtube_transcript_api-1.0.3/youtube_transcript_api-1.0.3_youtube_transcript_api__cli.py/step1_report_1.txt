{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface (CLI) for fetching YouTube video transcripts, supporting various options like language preferences, proxy configurations, and translation.",
  "sources": "User-provided input includes command-line arguments such as video IDs, proxy URLs, cookies file path, translation language, and other flags.",
  "sinks": "Input values influence proxy configuration, file paths, and language choices, but do not directly lead to data leaks or system effects within this code.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed and used to configure API calls and proxy settings. The proxy URLs and cookie path are used in API initialization, and video IDs are sanitized before processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. Proxy configurations are flexible and based on user input; no insecure practices are apparent. No obfuscated code or unusual logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles argument parsing, configuration, and API calls to fetch transcripts. Proxy setup and video ID sanitization are straightforward. Exception handling is generic, and output formatting depends on user-selected options. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is detected. No sensitive data handling or insecure operations are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a legitimate CLI wrapper for a YouTube transcript API, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It relies on user input for configuration and performs typical argument parsing and API interaction without dangerous behaviors.",
