  "purpose": "A CLI tool for fetching YouTube transcripts with support for proxies, translation, filtering, and formatting, based on user inputs.",
  "sources": "User-supplied command-line arguments for proxies, credentials, video IDs, languages, and other options.",
  "sinks": "API calls to YouTubeTranscriptApi, network requests influenced by user inputs, output formatting.",
  "flows": "Input arguments influence proxy configuration, API interactions, and output formatting; data flows from user input through API calls to output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected; straightforward data flow and configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a transparent CLI wrapper for a YouTube transcript API, relying entirely on user inputs for configuration. Proxy credentials and URLs are provided at runtime, not embedded. Exception handling is generic, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The data flow is standard, with inputs affecting network requests and output formatting. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the functionality and potential misuse vectors, which are typical for such tools but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent CLI utility for retrieving YouTube transcripts. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low risk score reflects minimal security concerns, primarily related to user-controlled network configurations, which are standard in such applications. Overall, the code appears safe and suitable for use.",
