{
  "purpose": "The code implements a raster grid data structure with arithmetic operations, interpolation, cropping, resampling, and coordinate transformations, primarily for geospatial data processing.",
  "sources": "Class properties, input parameters, numpy arrays, CRS information, and method arguments that provide data, bounds, and configuration.",
  "sinks": "In-memory numpy array manipulations, CRS transformations, and data interpolations; no external system calls or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows through numpy/scipy functions, CRS transformations, and grid operations, with source data being combined, interpolated, or transformed into new grid instances.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or external system interactions. Minor note on the data setter not validating input data beyond shape and dtype, which is typical in scientific libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive raster grid management library, utilizing operator overloading, numpy/scipy for data manipulation, and pyproj for coordinate transformations. It performs standard GIS operations such as arithmetic, interpolation, cropping, and resampling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external system calls are evident. The code is complex but aligns with typical geospatial data processing practices, with appropriate exception handling and warnings. The data setter could be improved with validation, but this does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured geospatial raster processing library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its scientific purpose and standard operations.",
