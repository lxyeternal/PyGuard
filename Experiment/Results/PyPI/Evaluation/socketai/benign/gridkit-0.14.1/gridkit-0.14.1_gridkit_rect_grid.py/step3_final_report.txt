{
  "purpose": "The code implements spatial grid classes for geographic data handling, including coordinate transformations, spatial queries, and data management within a geospatial context.",
  "sources": "User parameters (dx, dy, size, area, offset, rotation), external libraries (numpy, scipy, pyproj), internal modules for grid operations.",
  "sinks": "No external system interactions, network calls, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows through spatial computations, CRS transformations, and grid queries, all within standard geospatial processing routines.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, suspicious constructs, or malicious logic detected. Usage of warnings for side length discrepancies is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of spatial grid classes, relying on well-known libraries. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage indicators are present. The code handles spatial data, CRS transformations, and spatial queries in a typical manner, with proper validation and data handling. No signs of obfuscation or malicious network activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured spatial grid module with no malicious or sabotage features. The security risk is minimal, and the current scores are justified based on the code's functionality and structure.",
