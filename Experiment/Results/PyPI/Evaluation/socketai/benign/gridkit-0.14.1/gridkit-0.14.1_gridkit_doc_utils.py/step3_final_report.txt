  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating 2D doughnut points with Gaussian noise and plotting shapely polygons with color mapping for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for point generation and polygon geometries; fixed seed setting (numpy.random.seed(0)); no external data or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Uses input parameters and geometries; no untrusted data sinks, no data leaks, no network communication, no system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> point generation and plotting functions; fixed seed influences randomness; geometries passed directly to plotting routines.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fixed seed (numpy.random.seed(0)) for reproducibility; no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard libraries for data generation and visualization. No network, file, or system access is present. The fixed seed is a common practice for reproducibility, not malicious. No obfuscation or hidden code is detected. The functions serve visualization purposes with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as visualization utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The low risk score (around 0.1) assigned in the reports is justified. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
