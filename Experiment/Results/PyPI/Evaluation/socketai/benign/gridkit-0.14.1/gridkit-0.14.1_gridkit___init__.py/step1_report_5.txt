{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules and functions from the 'gridkit' package, likely to perform spatial data processing and analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'gridkit' modules, which do not process input data directly but make functions and classes available for use.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted code are present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow is observable within the provided code; it only consists of import statements.",
  "anomalies": "All imported modules and functions appear standard and relevant to spatial grid processing. No suspicious or unusual code, such as obfuscated strings, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic execution, is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is limited to importing modules and functions from a known spatial data processing library. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. The imports are relevant and standard for such a library, indicating typical usage rather than malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely imports functions and classes from the 'gridkit' package without executing any potentially malicious actions. Based on this, there is no evidence of malware or security risks within this snippet.",
