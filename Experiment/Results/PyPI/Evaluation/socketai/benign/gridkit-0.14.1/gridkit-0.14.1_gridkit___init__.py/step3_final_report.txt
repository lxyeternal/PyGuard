  "purpose": "Import statements from the 'gridkit' library related to spatial data processing and grid management.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'gridkit' modules, including statistical functions, grid types, IO, version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only static imports, no data flow or runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a reputable open-source spatial data library. No runtime logic, data handling, or network activity is present. The imports are from well-known modules related to grids, statistics, IO, and versioning. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate given the benign static nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as static imports alone do not pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statements are standard and do not introduce vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments in the reports are justified and should remain as is.",
