  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent spatial grid implementation with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low, approximately 0.2, reflecting typical spatial data handling concerns. The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis and the code's functionality."
