  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured spatial grid management library with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects inherent risks in coordinate transformations but no malicious activity. No further action is necessary."
