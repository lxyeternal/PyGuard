  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code content confirmation**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`. There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or any code that could be malicious.\n\n2. **Presence of issues in the code**:  \nThe code appears straightforward, with no errors, flaws, or suspicious constructs. The classes are simple, with descriptive docstrings and no logic beyond inheritance.\n\n3. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning**:  \nThe reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security concerns. This is accurate given the code snippet.\n\n4. **Scores assigned to each issue**:  \nAll reports assign a confidence of 1.0 and scores of 0 for obfuscated, malware, and security risk. These are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Risk and malware scores justification**:  \n- The risk score of 0.0 is justified since the code only defines exception classes with no security impact.  \n- The malware score of 0.0 is justified because there is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n6. **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions**:  \nNo assumptions are made about hidden vulnerabilities; the analysis correctly states that the code is benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores**:  \nScores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's content.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:  \n- The code is purely defining two custom exception classes, with no malicious or security-related concerns.  \n- The malware score should remain at 0.0.  \n- The risk score should stay at 0.0, as there is no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, given the code clarity.\n\n**Final estimate**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0.0  \n- **Risk score**: 0.0\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is benign, with no security risks or malware concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
