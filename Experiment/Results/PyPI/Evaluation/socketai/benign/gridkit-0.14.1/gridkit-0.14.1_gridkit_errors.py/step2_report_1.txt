  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes: `AlignmentError` and `IntersectionError`.\n   - Both classes inherit from `Exception` and contain only docstrings and `pass`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is straightforward, benign, and serves as error indicators.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of data flows, external interactions, or malicious content.\n   - The reports consistently assign a confidence of 1.0 and scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — correct, as the code is clear and unobfuscated.\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — accurate, no malicious intent or payload.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0 — justified, as defining exception classes alone does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate, since no security concerns are evident.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Misinterpretations:**\n   - The only point to consider is whether defining exception classes could be exploited. Given their simplicity and typical usage, this is not a security concern.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n6. **My Personal Estimate:**\n   - **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n   - **Risk:** 0 — no security risk associated with defining exception classes.\n\n**Final Summary:**\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate and well-justified. No further action or scoring adjustments are needed.",
