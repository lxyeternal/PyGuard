  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with docstrings and pass statements.\n   - No data input/output, data flow, or external interactions are present.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is benign, minimal code serving as error indicators.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly state that the code is straightforward, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0 or 0.0\n     - Malware: 0 or 0.0\n     - Security risk: 0.0 or 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified.\n   - No reason to increase the risk score since there's no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign malware score 0, consistent with the code.\n   - No malicious intent or code is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that this code alone does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is purely defining two custom exception classes with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Therefore, my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
