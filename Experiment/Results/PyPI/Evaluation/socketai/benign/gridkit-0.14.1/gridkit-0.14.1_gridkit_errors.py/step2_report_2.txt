  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`. There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or any logic that could be malicious.\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No issues such as hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Reasoning**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly conclude that the code is benign and serves as part of a larger system for error handling.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0.0, `obfuscated` scores of 0, and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` scores are all 1.0, reflecting certainty in their assessments.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious intent, there is no justification for a high risk score.\n   - The risk scores of 0.0 across all reports are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**:\n   - The malware scores are correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity or code.\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and stick to factual analysis. They correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Justification**:\n- The code is a simple, standard definition of custom exception classes, common in many codebases.\n- No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code poses no security threat.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0.0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis above.",
