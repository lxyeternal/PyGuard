  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for grid alignment and intersection errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data propagation present",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception with docstrings. There are no data inputs, external interactions, or complex logic. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python exception handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code does not contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining two custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where these exceptions are used for error handling. No malware or security risks are present.",
