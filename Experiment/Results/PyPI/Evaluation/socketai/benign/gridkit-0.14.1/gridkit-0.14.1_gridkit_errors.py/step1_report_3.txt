  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or handling points identified.",
  "flows": "N/A, as no data flow or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only exception class definitions; no suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two simple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception with docstrings describing their purpose. There is no data processing, external input, or malicious activity. The structure and content are straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden code. The code appears to serve as part of a larger project to handle grid-related errors, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
