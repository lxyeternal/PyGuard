  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for grid alignment and intersection errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No output or data transmission points involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code only defines exception classes without additional logic or behavior; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, each with a docstring describing their purpose. There is no logic, data handling, or external interactions. The classes serve as markers for specific error conditions related to grid alignment and intersection. No malicious or suspicious code is present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless and purely defines exception classes without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
