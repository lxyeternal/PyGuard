  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for grid alignment and intersection errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code solely defines exception classes",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; straightforward class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code provides two custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings. These classes inherit from Exception and contain no additional logic or data. There are no input sources, data handling, or potential vulnerabilities. The structure is simple and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign definition of custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger application, serving as error handling classes.",
