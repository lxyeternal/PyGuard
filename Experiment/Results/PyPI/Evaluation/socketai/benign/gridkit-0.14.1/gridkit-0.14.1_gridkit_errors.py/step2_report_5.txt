  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception` with docstrings and `pass` statements.\n   - No data processing, external interactions, or logic are present.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No significant logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1.0 (fully confident)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (no obfuscation)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes with no malicious or risky behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The reports' zero scores for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual content.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely structural and error-defining.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nGiven the code snippet and the reports, I concur with the assessments. The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code appears to be a straightforward, safe part of a larger system, serving solely as error indicator classes.",
