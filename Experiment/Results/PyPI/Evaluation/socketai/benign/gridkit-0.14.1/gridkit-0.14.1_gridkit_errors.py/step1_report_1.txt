  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling grid alignment and intersection errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leak points present",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; code only defines exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception with docstrings and pass statements. There are no function calls, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The classes serve as simple error indicators for grid-related errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining exception classes with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger system handling grid operations, and this snippet alone does not contain any malware or security risks.",
