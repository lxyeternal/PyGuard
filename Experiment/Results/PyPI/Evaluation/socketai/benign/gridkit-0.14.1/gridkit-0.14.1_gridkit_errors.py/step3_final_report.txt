  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to grid alignment and intersection issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with no data input, external interactions, or dynamic data flows.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares classes without data flow or logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with docstrings and pass statements only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings and no additional logic. There are no data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or suspicious patterns. The code is clear, unobfuscated, and serves as part of error handling in a larger system. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning high confidence and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or malicious constructs justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
