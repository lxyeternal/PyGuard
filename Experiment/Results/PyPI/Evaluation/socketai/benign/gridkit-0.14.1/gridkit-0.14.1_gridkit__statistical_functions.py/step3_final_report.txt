{
  "purpose": "Provides spatial grid manipulation functions including bounds calculation, combined grid creation, counting, summing, and averaging, primarily for geospatial data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads grid object properties such as bounds, data, crs, and nodata_value; calls methods like is_aligned_with, update, assign, cells_in_bounds.",
  "sinks": "Uses numpy for array operations; no external data sinks or network activity; potential data leakage if grid objects contain sensitive info, but unlikely.",
  "flows": "Reads grid properties and methods (sources), processes data with numpy arrays, and updates or returns grid objects (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded dtype=float and default NaN values for missing data; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spatial data operations with numpy arrays, relying on grid object methods assumed to be from a trusted library. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. Minor concerns about hardcoded defaults are typical in numerical processing and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign spatial data utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security concern relates to default NaN handling and data types, which are standard practices. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, and no modifications are necessary.",
