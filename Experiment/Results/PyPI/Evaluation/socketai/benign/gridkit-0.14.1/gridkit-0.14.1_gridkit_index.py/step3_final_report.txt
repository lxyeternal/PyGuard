{
  "purpose": "A utility class for managing spatial grid indices, supporting set operations, sorting, and conversions between index representations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions and class constructors, class properties, iteration over internal numpy arrays.",
  "sinks": "No external system calls, network activity, file I/O, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows internally through numpy array manipulations within class methods; no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated properties issuing warnings; iteration method implementation is unconventional but not malicious; broad exception handling in comparison operators masks errors but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard spatial index utility, with well-structured methods for set operations, sorting, and conversions. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. Minor bugs or design flaws (e.g., iteration implementation) are present but do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for spatial index management, with no malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The overall security risk is very low (~0.2), primarily due to minor implementation issues, not malicious activity.",
