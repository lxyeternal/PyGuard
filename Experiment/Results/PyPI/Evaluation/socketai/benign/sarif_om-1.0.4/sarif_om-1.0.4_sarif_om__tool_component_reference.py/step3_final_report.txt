  "purpose": "Data container class for referencing tool components, including guid, index, name, and properties.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions; no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; class only defines data attributes without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "Default value of 'index' set to -1, which is a common placeholder; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class using the 'attr' library with four attributes, all with default values. There are no functions, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation. The code serves solely as a data structure, with no signs of malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns. The default 'index' value of -1 is typical for uninitialized or placeholder fields. All reports correctly assess the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data container with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
