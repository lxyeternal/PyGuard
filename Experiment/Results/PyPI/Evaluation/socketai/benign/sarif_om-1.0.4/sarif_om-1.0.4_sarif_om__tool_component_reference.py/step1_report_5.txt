  "purpose": "Defines a data class 'ToolComponentReference' for representing tool components with metadata.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input or external data read.",
  "sinks": "None; no data outputs or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a default value of -1 for 'index' could be unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'attr' and defines a class with attributes that have default values. It is a straightforward data structure with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the default index value, which is typical for placeholder or optional fields.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple data class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious or harmful.",
