  "purpose": "Define a data class ToolComponentReference for identifying tool components, such as drivers or extensions.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a class with default attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "None; as the code only declares a class, there are no data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class declaration with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'attr' library and defines a class 'ToolComponentReference' with four attributes: guid, index, name, and properties. The attributes have default values and metadata for schema property names. There is no input/output, data handling, or execution logic. The code appears to be a simple data structure definition. No signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign data class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply models a tool component reference with no external data interactions or security concerns.",
