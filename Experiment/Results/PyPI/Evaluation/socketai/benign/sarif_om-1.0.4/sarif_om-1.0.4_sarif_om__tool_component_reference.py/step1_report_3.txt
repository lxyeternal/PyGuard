{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure for referencing a tool component, either driver or extension, with identifiers and properties.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; class definition with default attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths; purely a data container with no operations or data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; class attributes are defaulted, no processing or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library 'attr' for attribute management and defines a simple class with default attributes and metadata. No external input, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. It appears to be a straightforward data model intended for serialization or data handling within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data class definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely provides a structure to hold tool component references.",
