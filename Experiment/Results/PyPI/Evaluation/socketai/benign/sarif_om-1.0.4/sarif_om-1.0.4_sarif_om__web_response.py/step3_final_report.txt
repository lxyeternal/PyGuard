  "purpose": "Modeling an HTTP response with various attributes such as body, headers, status code, etc., for use in network communication or API handling.",
  "sources": "Input data received from network responses, API calls, or external HTTP sources.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows into attributes like body, headers, or status_code, which could lead to injection or data leakage if improperly handled elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data from network or external sources flows into the class attributes; no internal flows or processing are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected within this code snippet; it is a straightforward data container. The reports of 'Empty response' are external observations, not code issues.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class 'WebResponse' with optional fields, generated by a schema tool. The reports indicate only that responses are empty, which is a normal scenario in network operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities in this code. The absence of response data ('raw_response' being empty) does not imply security issues; it could be due to network errors or server conditions. Given the lack of malicious indicators, the malware score should be zero, obfuscation score zero, and overall security risk minimal. The code itself is benign, and the reports do not suggest any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign data schema for HTTP responses. The external reports of empty responses do not indicate malicious activity or vulnerabilities. Therefore, the security assessment assigns a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1), reflecting normal operational conditions without security concerns.",
