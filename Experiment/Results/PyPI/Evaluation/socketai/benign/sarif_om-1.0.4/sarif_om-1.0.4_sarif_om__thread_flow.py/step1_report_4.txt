  "purpose": "Define a data structure for describing a sequence of code locations within a thread of execution.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No output or data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'attr' library and defines a class 'ThreadFlow' with several attributes, all of which are standard data fields. There are no functions executing external commands, no network operations, and no handling of untrusted input or output. The class appears to be a schema or data container for thread execution paths. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data schema definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
