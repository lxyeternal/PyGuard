{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure representing a sequence of code locations within a thread of execution.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources; class attributes are statically defined.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; class attributes are only for data storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single class definition using the 'attr' library for data modeling. It includes only attribute definitions with metadata annotations. There are no external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network interactions. The code appears to be a straightforward data container with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple data class intended for modeling thread flow data. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
