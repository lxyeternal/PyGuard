{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure representing a directed edge in a graph, with attributes such as id, source_node_id, target_node_id, label, and properties.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources; class attributes are statically defined.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points where untrusted data could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code simply declares a data class with no processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of the 'attr' library is standard; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Edge' with attributes decorated using the 'attr' library. No input handling, network calls, or data processing are present. The class appears to serve as a simple data container for graph edges. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The comments and metadata are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data structure definition with no signs of malware or security risks. It appears benign and intended for representing graph edges within larger systems.",
