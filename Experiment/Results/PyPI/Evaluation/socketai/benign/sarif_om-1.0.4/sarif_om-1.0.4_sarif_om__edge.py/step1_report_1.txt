{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure representing a directed graph edge with attributes such as id, source, target, label, and properties.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only defines a class structure.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a static class definition without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The comment indicates code generation but does not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library 'attr' for class attribute definitions and creates a class 'Edge' to model graph edges. No input reading, network activity, or executable code is present. The class is purely a data container with optional and default attributes. There are no suspicious patterns, code injections, or malicious constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data class definition for graph edges with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any I/O, network, or sensitive operations.",
