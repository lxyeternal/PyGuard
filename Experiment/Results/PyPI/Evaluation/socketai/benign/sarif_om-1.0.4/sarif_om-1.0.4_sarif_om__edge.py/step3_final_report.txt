  "purpose": "Define a data structure representing a directed edge in a graph with attributes such as id, source node, target node, label, and properties.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static class attributes defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a static data class with no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Python class using the 'attr' library to model a graph edge with attributes. It contains no input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The class is purely a data container with no malicious or security-sensitive logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety and non-malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static data class representing graph edges, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
