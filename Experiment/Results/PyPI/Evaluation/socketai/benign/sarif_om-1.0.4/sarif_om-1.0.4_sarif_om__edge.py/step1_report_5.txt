{
  "purpose": "Defines a data structure for representing a directed graph edge using the attrs library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definition with attribute declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, storage, or output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are no functions or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with standard usage of attrs library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the attrs library and defines a class 'Edge' with attributes representing a graph edge. No input reading, data handling, or external communication present. The class serves as a simple data container with metadata annotations, typical for structured data modeling. No suspicious or malicious code segments detected, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be purely structural and functional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and serves its purpose of modeling graph edges.",
