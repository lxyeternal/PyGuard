  "purpose": "Define a data structure representing a directed edge in a graph.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definition does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library 'attr' and defines a class 'Edge' with attributes for graph representation. There are no input, output, or external data handling functions. The code is straightforward and appears solely as a data container without any execution logic or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple data class definition for representing graph edges, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security issues.",
