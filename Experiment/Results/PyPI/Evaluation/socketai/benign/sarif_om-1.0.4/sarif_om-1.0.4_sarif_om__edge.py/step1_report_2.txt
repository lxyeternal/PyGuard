  "purpose": "Define a data structure representing a directed edge in a graph with metadata annotations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static class definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or external calls; purely a data container.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow between sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of attr library is standard for data classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Edge' using the 'attr' library to model graph edges with properties such as id, source node ID, target node ID, label, and additional properties. It contains no dynamic execution, no input handling, no network operations, and no obfuscated or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a straightforward data model intended for use within a larger application. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues. The presence of the 'attr' library is typical for data classes in Python and does not pose any risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign data structure definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation of a graph edge class using the 'attr' library, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
