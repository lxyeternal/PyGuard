  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a simple data class `Edge` using the `attr` library.\n   - Attributes include `id`, `source_node_id`, `target_node_id`, `label`, and `properties`.\n   - There are no functions, input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The code is purely structural, intended for representing graph edges.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No input handling, external data processing, or network communication.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious logic, or code injection vectors.\n   - The use of `attr` is standard for data classes in Python.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is a benign data structure definition.\n   - They assign high confidence (1) that there are no anomalies, malware, or security risks.\n   - The reasoning is consistent across all reports; none identify any security concern.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 is correct; code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 is justified given the absence of any security concerns.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume the code is used within a larger application, but as-is, it doesn't introduce any vulnerabilities.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified based on this code alone.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, safe data class for graph edges.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores given in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code is benign and poses no security threat.",
