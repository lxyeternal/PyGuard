{
  "purpose": "Define a class representing a tool with metadata, likely for analysis or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'attr' library; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not handle untrusted input or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a straightforward class definition with no suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'attr' library to define a class 'Tool' with three attributes: 'driver', 'extensions', and 'properties'. The 'driver' attribute is mandatory, while the other two have default values of None. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity. The code appears to be boilerplate or generated code, serving as a data structure for storing tool-related metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, generated class definition for holding tool metadata. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious logic, or security risks. The code appears benign and unrelated to any malicious activity.",
