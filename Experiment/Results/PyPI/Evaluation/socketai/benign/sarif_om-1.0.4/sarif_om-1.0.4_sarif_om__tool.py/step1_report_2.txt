  "purpose": "Defines a data structure for an analysis tool with attributes for driver, extensions, and properties.",
  "sources": "The class attributes 'driver', 'extensions', and 'properties' which may receive input data.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of 'driver', 'extensions', and 'properties' if they are populated with untrusted data, but no direct sinks like network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Input data can flow into the class attributes; however, no processing, execution, or output occurs in the code snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class using the 'attr' library to generate boilerplate methods. There are no data manipulations, external calls, or suspicious logic. The attributes could potentially receive untrusted input if instantiated with external data, but the code itself does not process or act on such data. No malware or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard data class definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
