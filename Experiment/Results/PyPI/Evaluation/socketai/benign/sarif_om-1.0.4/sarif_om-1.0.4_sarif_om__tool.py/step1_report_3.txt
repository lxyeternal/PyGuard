  "purpose": "Define a data structure for an analysis tool with attributes for driver, extensions, and properties.",
  "sources": "Importing 'attr' library; class attribute definitions with metadata.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static class definition with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library and defines a class with three attributes. The attributes include metadata, but no code execution, data input handling, or external interactions are present. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns observed; the code appears to be a straightforward data class definition intended for structured data storage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely sets up a data structure and does not perform any runtime operations or data processing.",
