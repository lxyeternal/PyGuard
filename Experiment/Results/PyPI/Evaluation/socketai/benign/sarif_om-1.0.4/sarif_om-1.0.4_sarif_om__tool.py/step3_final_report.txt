  "purpose": "Defines a data class 'Tool' with attributes 'driver', 'extensions', and 'properties' for schema representation.",
  "sources": "Attribute assignments within the class; no external data input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond class attribute initialization; no runtime data processing or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, schema-generated data class using the 'attr' library. It contains no dynamic code, input/output, network activity, or malicious patterns. All attributes are standard, with 'driver' required and others optional. The code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be malicious. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence level is high (1), consistent with the straightforward analysis. No issues or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and the analysis confirms its harmless nature. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
