  "purpose": "Define a data class 'Tool' for analysis tool metadata with schema properties.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definition and attribute initializations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only defines a class structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'attr' for attribute management and defines a class 'Tool' with three attributes: 'driver', 'extensions', and 'properties'. 'driver' appears to be a required field, while 'extensions' and 'properties' are optional with default None. There are no input/output operations, network access, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward class definition with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple data class definition for metadata storage, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
