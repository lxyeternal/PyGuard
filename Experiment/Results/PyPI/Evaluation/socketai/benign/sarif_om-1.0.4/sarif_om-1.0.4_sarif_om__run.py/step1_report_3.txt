  "purpose": "Define a data structure for capturing details of an analysis tool's run, including various metadata and results.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code mainly declares a class with attributes. It does not read external input directly.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as the code only defines a class structure without data handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be a standard class definition generated by a schema tool.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'attr' and defines a class 'Run' with multiple attributes, each with optional default values and metadata. The class is used for data modeling purposes. No external data handling, network activity, or code execution is present. The code seems to be auto-generated schema-related code, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward data class definition for capturing analysis run data. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, schema-generated Python class used for data organization.",
