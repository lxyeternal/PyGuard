  "purpose": "Define a data structure for storing analysis run information using attrs library.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; static class definition with default values.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this is a data container.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic; straightforward attribute definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a schema-derived class using the attrs library, with various attributes representing different aspects of an analysis run. All attributes have default values or factories, and no functions or dynamic code execution are present. There are no external inputs, no code injection points, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be purely declarative, intended for data storage and serialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign data class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause harm.",
