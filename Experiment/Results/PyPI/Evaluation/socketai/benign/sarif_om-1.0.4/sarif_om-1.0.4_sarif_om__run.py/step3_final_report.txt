  "purpose": "Defines a data schema class 'Run' for storing analysis tool run details, including metadata and results.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; attributes are initialized with defaults or factories.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external output or data flow to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static attribute definitions without data processing or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated schema with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static class definition using 'attr' with numerous attributes, all with default values or factories. It contains no functions, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. No embedded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be auto-generated schema documentation for data organization, with no data flows or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated data schema with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, declarative structure intended for data storage, not execution or external interaction.",
