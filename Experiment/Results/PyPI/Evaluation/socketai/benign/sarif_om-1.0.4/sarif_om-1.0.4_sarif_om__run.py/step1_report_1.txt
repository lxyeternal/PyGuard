  "purpose": "Defines a data class 'Run' for storing analysis tool execution details and outputs.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent to external systems or manipulated for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present as the code only defines a class with attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward data class with no suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated parts. No dynamic execution or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the 'attr' library to create a structured data class with various attributes, most with default values or factories. There are no external input sources, no data flows, no code execution, no embedded secrets, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be auto-generated documentation or schema representation for analysis results.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data schema definition with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions solely to structure data related to analysis runs.",
