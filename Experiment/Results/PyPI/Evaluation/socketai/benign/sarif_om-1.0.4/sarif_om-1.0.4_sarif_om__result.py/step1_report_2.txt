  "sources": "No external input or data sources; class attributes are statically defined.",
  "targets": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; this is a simple data container class.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures. Usage of 'attr' library is standard for data classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class 'Result' with multiple attributes, all initialized with default values or metadata. There are no external inputs, network calls, or execution of dynamic code. No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data structure definition with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe and typical for representing analysis results.",
