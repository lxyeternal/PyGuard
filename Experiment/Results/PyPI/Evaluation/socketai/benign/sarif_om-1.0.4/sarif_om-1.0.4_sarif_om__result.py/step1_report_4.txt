  "purpose": "Define a data structure for analysis results produced by a tool, likely for logging or reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code defines a class with attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output functions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only declares a class structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The comment indicates code generation but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the 'attr' library to define a class with many attributes, primarily string or NoneType. It appears to be an auto-generated schema representation. No input reading, network operations, or data processing occurs. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data structure definition for holding analysis result information. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
