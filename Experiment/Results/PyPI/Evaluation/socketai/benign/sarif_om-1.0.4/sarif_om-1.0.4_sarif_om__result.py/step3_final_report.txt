  "purpose": "Schema definition for analysis results, generated by jschema_to_python.",
  "sources": "Attribute definitions within the class, metadata annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, no external or untrusted data sources or sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static schema with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward auto-generated data class with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class 'Result' with multiple attributes, all static and metadata-rich. It contains no input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is generated by a schema tool, serving as a data container. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The structure is simple, declarative, and static, indicating no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated data schema with no malicious or obfuscated content. It poses no security threat, and the scores should be zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
