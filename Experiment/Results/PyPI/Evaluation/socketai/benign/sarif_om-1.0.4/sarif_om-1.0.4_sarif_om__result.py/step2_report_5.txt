  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward data class definition, with no input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- They find no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.\n- The confidence scores are all at 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Confirmation of code content:**\n- The code is a static schema using the 'attr' library to define a 'Result' class with many attributes.\n- No functions, no data processing, no external interactions.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as a data container.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n- The reports are accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and schema-like.\n- No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n- The reasoning that this code poses no security risks is sound.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all evidence points to a simple data class with no malicious behavior, the scores should remain at 0.\n- No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n**Malware score:**\n- Confirmed as 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code is auto-generated schema with no malicious intent, which is consistent with the content.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made, which is appropriate.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is a benign, auto-generated data schema.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe data class definition with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. The reports are accurate and thorough.",
