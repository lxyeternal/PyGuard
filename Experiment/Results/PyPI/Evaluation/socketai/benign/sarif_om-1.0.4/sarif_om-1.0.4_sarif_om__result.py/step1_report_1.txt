  "purpose": "Definition of a data class representing analysis results, used for structuring output data.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; purely class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or external communication points; only class attribute declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is a static schema definition.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual comment about generated code, but no malicious or suspicious logic present; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class 'Result' with multiple attributes annotated using 'attr.s' and 'attr.ib'. It serves as a schema for analysis results, with metadata for property naming. No input handling, data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be automatically generated documentation for a data structure, not executable logic that could perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward schema definition for analysis results, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. It is safe and primarily serves as a data container.",
