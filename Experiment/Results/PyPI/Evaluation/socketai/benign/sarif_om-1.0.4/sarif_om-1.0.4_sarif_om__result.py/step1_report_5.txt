  "purpose": "Define a data structure 'Result' to hold analysis tool output, including various metadata fields.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of external data; the code is a class definition with default attribute values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems; no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only declares a data class with default attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. No dynamic execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition using the 'attr' library to create a data container. It contains no input handling, no network activity, no code injection, or other suspicious behaviors. All attributes are standard data fields with default values, and there are no functions performing malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data container class with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could harm or compromise a system.",
