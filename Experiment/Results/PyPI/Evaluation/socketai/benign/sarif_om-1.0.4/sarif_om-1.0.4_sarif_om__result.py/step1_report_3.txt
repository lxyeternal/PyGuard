  "purpose": "Define a data structure for representing analysis results in a security or code analysis tool.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading functions; all data is stored in class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or functions that process untrusted data; the class only holds data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the class is a passive data container.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library ('attr') to define a class with attributes. The class 'Result' serves as a schema for analysis results, with numerous fields related to analysis metadata and findings. All attributes are simple data holders with no methods or functions that execute code or handle external inputs at runtime. The code appears to be a standard data model definition, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. There are no indications of data exfiltration, code injection, or other malicious activities. It simply structures data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign schema definition for holding analysis results. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is a standard data class used in security tools.",
