  "purpose": "Data schema modeling an address with various attributes in a memory or file context.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; attributes are defaulted and metadata annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class using 'attr' with attributes for address representation. It contains no functions, input/output, network calls, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The code serves as a data container, and all reports concur on its benign nature, assigning scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence in this assessment is high (1). The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated data schema for address information with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
