{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class 'Address' to represent memory or file addresses with various attributes.",
  "sources": "No input sources; this code only defines a data structure.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as no input/output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'attr' library and defines a class 'Address' with multiple attributes, each having default values and metadata annotations. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. It functions solely as a data container. The code appears to be automatically generated, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward data class definition used for representing address information. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code is benign and serves purely as a schema or data structure.",
