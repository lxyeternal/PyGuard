  "purpose": "Define a data structure for representing addresses in memory or files using the attr library.",
  "sources": "None; no input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or data leakage points observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is evident, as this is a simple class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code is straightforward class definition with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'attr' and defines a class 'Address' with several attributes, each with default values and metadata for schema property names. There are no input operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The class appears to be a plain data container without any embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious class definition for data modeling. No security issues or malicious behaviors are identified.",
