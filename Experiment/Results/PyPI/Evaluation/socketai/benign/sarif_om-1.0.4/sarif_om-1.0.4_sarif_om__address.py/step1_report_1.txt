  "purpose": "Define a data class representing an address with various properties, likely used for modeling memory or file regions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No potential sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward data class definition using 'attr' library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'attr' library and defines a class 'Address' with multiple attributes, each with default values and metadata annotations. The class is purely a data container with no logic, input/output, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscated code. The structure and content are standard for a data model in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign data model definition for representing addresses, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
