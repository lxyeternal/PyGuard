{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class 'Address' for representing memory or file addresses with various attributes.",
  "sources": "No input sources or external data reads present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external calls, or data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines a class structure.",
  "anomalies": "Uses attr.s to create a data class, with no apparent malicious or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'attr' library and defines a class 'Address' with multiple attributes, all with default values. There are no function calls, no external data handling, and no logic that could be exploited or malicious. The structure appears to be a simple data container without any dynamic or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data class definition for addresses, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and serves as a schema/model for data representation.",
