  "purpose": "Define a data structure for representing addresses in memory or binary files using attrs library.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No potential data leaks or insecure operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition using the 'attr' library to model address-related data. It only defines attributes with default values and metadata, without any dynamic code execution, input handling, or external network interaction. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a simple, benign data container.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign class definition with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It functions as a schema for address data with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
