  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data structure using the 'attr' library. It only includes class and attribute definitions with default values and metadata. There are no external inputs, network calls, or data processing. The code appears to be standard, well-formed, and intended for data modeling purposes without any signs of malicious intent or obfuscated behavior.",
