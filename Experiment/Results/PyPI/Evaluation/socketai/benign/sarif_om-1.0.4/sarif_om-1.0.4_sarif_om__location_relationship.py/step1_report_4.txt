  "purpose": "Define a data class representing information about the relation of one location to another.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or output data, nor interact with untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of attr library for data class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the attr library and defines a class LocationRelationship with several attributes, some with default values and metadata. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The class appears to be a straightforward data container generated by a schema conversion tool. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
