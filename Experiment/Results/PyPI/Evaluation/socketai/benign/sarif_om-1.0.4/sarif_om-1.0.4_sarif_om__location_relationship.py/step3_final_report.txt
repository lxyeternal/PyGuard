  "purpose": "Defines a schema data class 'LocationRelationship' with attributes for representing relationships between locations.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a static class definition with default attribute values.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process data flows or handle input/output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, generated schema, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class using the 'attr' library, with attributes 'target', 'description', 'kinds', and 'properties'. It contains no functions, dynamic code, or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The default values and metadata are standard for schema definitions. The code is benign and purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward schema data class with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the code's nature.",
