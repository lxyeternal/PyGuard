{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure representing the relationship between locations, likely for schema validation or data modeling.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class attributes are static and default values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to critical points; class attributes are static or default values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda function in default_factory is standard for mutable defaults; no unusual code or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class with attributes for location relationships, using attrs library. It uses default values and metadata for schema properties. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The structure appears standard and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data class definition with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
