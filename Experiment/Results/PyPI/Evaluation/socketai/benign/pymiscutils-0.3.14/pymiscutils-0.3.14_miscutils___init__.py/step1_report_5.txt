{
  "purpose": "The code defines an `__all__` list for a module's public API and imports various functions, classes, and mixins from local modules and an external `subtypes` package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.functions, .base, .context, .parser, .mixin) and an external package (subtypes).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communications; no network, file, or system modification code is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up namespace exports and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The import statements are straightforward. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a module's public API via `__all__` and imports various functions and classes from local modules and an external package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The external package `subtypes` is a known library. The structure and naming are typical for a modular Python package. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code appears to be a standard module initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup with imports and export definitions. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
