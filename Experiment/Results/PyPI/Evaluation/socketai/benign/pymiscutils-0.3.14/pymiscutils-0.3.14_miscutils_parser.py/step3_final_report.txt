  "purpose": "A nested parser class for processing text with delimiter tags, supporting recursion, visualization, and function application.",
  "sources": "String data within the text, using the 'Str' class's find_all method to locate delimiters.",
  "sinks": "Application of user-supplied functions in apply_outward and __apply_deeper methods; no direct data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Source: self.text and delimiter positions; Sink: functions applied in apply_outward/__apply_deeper; Flow passes through recursive parsing and function application.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external 'Str' class without provided implementation; reliance on user-provided functions which could be malicious if untrusted; no other suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard nested parser with visualization and transformation capabilities. It uses an external 'Str' class for string searches, which is not inherently malicious but introduces dependency uncertainty. The parser manages nesting via counters and raises errors on mismatched delimiters. The functions 'apply_outward' and '__apply_deeper' accept external functions, which could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but this pattern is common in flexible string processing utilities. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The main potential risk stems from external function execution and reliance on an external 'Str' class, but these are outside the code's internal logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard nested parser with visualization features. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent is present. The primary security consideration is the use of external functions that could be malicious if misused, but this is a typical pattern in such utilities. Overall, the code is low risk and safe for use.",
