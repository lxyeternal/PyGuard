  "purpose": "A class for parsing and visualizing nested structures within strings, handling delimiter pairs and recursion.",
  "sources": "Input text to the constructor; internal methods processing text and indices.",
  "sinks": "apply_outward method applies a user-provided function to the text; __apply_deeper applies functions recursively; visualization outputs data.",
  "flows": "Input text -> constructor initializes structure -> apply_outward/__apply_deeper apply user function -> visualization displays structure.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic string manipulation with Str class, but no apparent malicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily parses nested delimiters in strings and provides visualization. It relies on a custom Str class for string searching, and handles nesting via counters and indices. The apply_outward method applies an external function to the parsed text, which could potentially be unsafe if the function is malicious, but this is expected and user-controlled. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are evident. The code does not perform network operations, file modifications, or other potentially malicious actions. The structure and methods are typical for parsing and visualization tasks, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward parser and visualizer for nested string structures without any malicious intent or security risks. Its design relies on safe string processing and user-supplied functions, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
