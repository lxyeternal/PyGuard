{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, reading metadata and dependencies from external files.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Reading files into variables, then passing data to setup() without dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no signs of malicious behavior. It reads dependencies and metadata from files, then calls setup(). No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity is present. The reports are empty, indicating no identified issues. The dependency list is external, which could be tampered with outside this code, but that is standard practice. Overall, the code is benign, with no malware or security flaws evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. The empty reports do not provide any evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores should be zero.",
