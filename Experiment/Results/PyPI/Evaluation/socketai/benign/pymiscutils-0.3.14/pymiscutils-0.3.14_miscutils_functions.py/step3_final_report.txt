{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for environment detection (IPython, user directory), class/type safety, traceback formatting, cross-platform beep, and extracting source code from small lambda functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input/data from sys.modules, inspect.getsourcelines, and environment variables; accesses internal attributes like sys.modules['__main__']._dh.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; primarily introspection and environment checks.",
  "flows": "Source data (e.g., lambda source, environment info) flows through parsing and inspection functions; no external or untrusted data flow leading to effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal attribute '__main__._dh' is unconventional but not malicious; source extraction relies on source code parsing, which is standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises benign utility functions for environment detection, class/type safety, traceback formatting, and lambda source extraction. No network, file modification, or malicious payloads are present. Use of internal attributes like '_dh' is unusual but not harmful. Source extraction functions are standard introspection tools. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The overall design is safe, with high confidence in benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, safe utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of internal attributes does not introduce vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
