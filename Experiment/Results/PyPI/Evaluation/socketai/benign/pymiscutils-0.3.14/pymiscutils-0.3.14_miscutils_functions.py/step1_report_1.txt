{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for environment detection, type checking, traceback formatting, and source code retrieval of lambda functions.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.modules, __future__ import, standard library modules (ast, inspect, os, sys, traceback), and attributes of passed arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses inspect.getsourcelines to retrieve source code, compile for lambda bodies, and potentially output via print or winsound.Beep.",
  "flows": "Source data from imported modules and function parameters flows into source extraction, AST parsing, and source compilation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. The get_short_lambda_source function performs source extraction with careful handling but could be misused to analyze other source code if misapplied.",
  "analysis": "The code provides environment detection (e.g., IPython detection, user directory checks), safe type and class checks, traceback formatting, and a method for extracting the source of small lambda functions. The use of inspect and AST parsing is standard and does not execute or evaluate untrusted code directly. The beep function adapts to platform, producing sounds in IPython and console alerts elsewhere. No data leaks, network connections, or system modifications are evident. The code primarily handles introspection and utility operations without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with no malicious intent. It performs environment checks, source code extraction, and simple interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
