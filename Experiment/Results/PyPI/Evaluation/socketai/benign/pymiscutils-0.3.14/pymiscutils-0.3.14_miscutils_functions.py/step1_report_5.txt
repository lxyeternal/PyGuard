  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment detection, type checking, traceback formatting, source extraction, and system interaction.",
  "sources": "sys.modules['__main__'].__file__, __IPYTHON__, inspect.getsourcelines, os.linesep, os.path, traceback.format_exception, sys.modules['__main__']",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data for external effects or leaks.",
  "flows": "No direct data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; functions primarily perform environment checks, type assessments, or source code analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The function get_short_lambda_source attempts to parse and analyze lambda source code, which is standard inspection behavior. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides environment detection (IPython, user directory), safe type and class checks, traceback formatting, and source retrieval for lambda functions. The functions rely on standard modules (ast, inspect, os, sys, traceback) without executing untrusted data or performing insecure operations. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects are evident. The source extraction for lambdas involves parsing source code, which could be misused if source code itself is malicious, but as-is, it is for introspection only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily utility and introspection functions that do not exhibit malicious intent or behavior. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security threats are detected based on this review.",
