  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for environment detection, type inspection, traceback formatting, and lambda source extraction.",
  "sources": "sys.modules, __main__, inspect.getsourcelines, os, traceback, ast",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data sinks or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow paths detected; functions operate on internal or system data",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.modules['__main__']. _dh[0] (internal attribute) may be unusual but is not inherently malicious; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors; get_short_lambda_source involves code parsing but appears to be a utility function",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple utility functions for environment detection (IPython, user tree), class/type inspection, traceback formatting, system sound, and extracting source code from lambda functions. No external data sources, network interactions, or file manipulations indicate malicious activity. The use of internal attributes (like _dh) is unconventional but not malicious. The lambda source extraction involves code parsing but appears to be a benign utility. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of utility functions with no malicious intent or malicious behavior. No malware indicators or security risks identified. The code’s design is benign and focused on environment and introspection utilities.",
