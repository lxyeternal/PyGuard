  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment detection, class inspection, traceback formatting, and lambda source retrieval.",
  "sources": "sys.modules for main module path, inspect.getsourcelines for lambda source, environment variables, imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no use of untrusted data sources or output sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as sys.modules, inspect, environment checks flow into utility functions for analysis or output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets detected. Use of ast and inspect for source code analysis is typical. The beep() function conditionally calls winsound, which could be misused if misrepresented, but in current context appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to detect execution context (IPython, user directory), class hierarchy safety, iterable types, class names, traceback string generation, and retrieval of lambda source code. It uses standard modules and practices. No obfuscated code, no hidden network calls, no data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns. The only notable feature is get_short_lambda_source, which extracts source code from a lambda, but it performs checks to ensure safety and correctness. The beep() function conditionally uses winsound on Windows, which could be misused but seems benign here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware are detected. The code is well-structured, and no security risks are evident in this isolated snippet.",
