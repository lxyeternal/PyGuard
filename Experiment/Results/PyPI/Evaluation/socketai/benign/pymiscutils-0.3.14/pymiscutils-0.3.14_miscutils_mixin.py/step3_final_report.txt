  "purpose": "Provides utility mixins for object representation, copying, and redirecting sys.stdout temporarily.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.stdout, os.devnull, and class attributes during method calls.",
  "sinks": "Writing to sys.stdout or os.devnull streams.",
  "flows": "write() method writes to sys.stdout or os.devnull; __enter__ redirects sys.stdout; __exit__ restores original stream.",
  "anomalies": "The stream attribute is initialized at class load time with open(os.devnull), which is shared across instances; could lead to unintended side effects if close() is called on one instance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three utility mixins: ReprMixin for object string representation, CopyMixin for shallow and deep copying, and StreamReplacerMixin for redirecting sys.stdout temporarily. The stream handling uses standard patterns, opening os.devnull at class load time and restoring sys.stdout in context managers. No malicious code, network activity, or hardcoded credentials are present. The pattern is common for output suppression. The shared class attribute for stream could cause resource management issues but does not constitute security risk. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module implementing standard patterns for object representation, copying, and stdout redirection. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present. The assigned scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
