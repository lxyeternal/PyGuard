{
  "purpose": "Define package data files for the 'passlib-stubs' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it primarily defines static package data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists; the code solely registers package data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code consists of a straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls the setup() function with a package_data argument. The package_data specifies various files (mostly .pyi and .py files) associated with the 'passlib-stubs' package. There are no input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, no use of environment variables, or other potentially malicious patterns. The structure and content are typical for a setup configuration file. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging Python stub files. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
