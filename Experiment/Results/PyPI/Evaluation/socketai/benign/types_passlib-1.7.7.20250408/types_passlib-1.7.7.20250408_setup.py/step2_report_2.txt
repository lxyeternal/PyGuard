  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script that defines static package data for 'passlib-stubs'.\n   - There are no indications of dynamic code execution, input handling, network activity, obfuscation, or embedded malicious payloads.\n   - The code only imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with a fixed dictionary of files.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reports.\n   - The code appears correctly structured for its purpose: packaging static files.\n   - No misconfigurations or potential security pitfalls are identified.\n\n3. **Score Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0.0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is reasonable because the code is purely declarative and static.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they recognize the code as a typical setup script.\n   - No suspicious behaviors or patterns are claimed or implied.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Given the static, benign configuration, no adjustment is necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard setup configuration for packaging Python files. No security concerns are present.**",
