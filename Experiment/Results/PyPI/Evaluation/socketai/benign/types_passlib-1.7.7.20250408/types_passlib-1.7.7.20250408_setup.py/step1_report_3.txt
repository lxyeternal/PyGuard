{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, specifying package data files for inclusion during installation.",
  "sources": "The source is the call to setuptools.setup() which reads static package data specified in the package_data argument.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted input or data processing; the code only specifies static data files for package distribution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is a standard package setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The package data appears to be a comprehensive list of type stub files (.pyi) and metadata files.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from setuptools and calls it with a package_data dictionary, listing numerous .pyi type stub files and metadata files. The structure is typical for defining package contents in a Python package distribution. There are no dynamic executions, input handling, or suspicious behaviors. The focus is solely on static configuration for package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The data listed are type stub files and metadata, which are common in open-source packages. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
