  "purpose": "Specify package data files for the 'passlib-stubs' Python package, including type stub files and metadata.",
  "sources": "Static list of file paths within the package data dictionary passed to setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only",
  "flows": "N/A; static data declaration without data flow or processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward static setup script with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with a fixed 'package_data' dictionary listing numerous .pyi stub files and metadata files. It is a static configuration script with no user input, network activity, or code execution. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code's intent is clear and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup configuration for packaging type stub files and metadata. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The assigned scores are accurate and justified.",
