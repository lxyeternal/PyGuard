{
  "purpose": "The code is configuring the packaging of Python stub files and metadata for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package data for 'passlib-stubs', specifically the list of .pyi files and the METADATA.toml and py.typed files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only defines package data for setup, which does not process untrusted input or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely specifies static package data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward setup configuration with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with a static dictionary defining package data for 'passlib-stubs'. All data is hardcoded, and there are no indications of dynamic execution or external data handling. No embedded code, user input, or network operations are present. The structure is typical for package configuration files, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script that declares package data for distribution. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign part of a Python package build process.",
