{
  "purpose": "This code defines the package data for a Python project using setuptools, specifically including various stub files for type hints within the 'passlib-stubs' package.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the call to the 'setup' function from setuptools, which reads the 'package_data' argument to specify included files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of 'setup' for packaging, which can indirectly affect installation behavior, but there are no immediate security-sensitive sinks such as code execution, network calls, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow involves the setup() function processing the 'package_data' argument to package the listed files; no untrusted data input or malicious flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code strictly defines package data files without dynamic code execution, environment variable use, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script solely calls 'setup' with static package data references, which are safe and standard for packaging. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, network communication, or credential handling. All file paths are within expected directories for type stub files. The absence of dynamic code, user input handling, or environment variable usage indicates no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup configuration for packaging Python stub files. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The package data is static and explicitly defined, with no suspicious elements.",
