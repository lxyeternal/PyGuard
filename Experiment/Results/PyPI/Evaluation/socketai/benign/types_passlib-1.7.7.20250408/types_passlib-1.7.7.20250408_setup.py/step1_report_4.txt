{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'passlib-stubs', specifying the package data files to include.",
  "sources": "The source is the call to 'setup' with the 'package_data' argument, which specifies the files to be included in the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data or untrusted code execution; the code is a static package configuration.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: the setup function reads the package_data dictionary and processes it during package installation; no untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is a typical setup configuration with a large list of file paths.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with a specified package_data dictionary, listing numerous .pyi and other files for inclusion. There is no user input, network activity, or code execution beyond standard package setup. The extensive list of file paths appears legitimate for a large package with stub files, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, listing files to include during installation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign and typical of package distribution files.",
