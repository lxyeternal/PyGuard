  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to specify package data files for 'passlib-stubs'.\n- All reports agree that the code is static, contains no dynamic execution, no user input, no network calls, and no obfuscation.\n- The package data consists mainly of .pyi stub files and metadata files, which are typical in open-source Python packages.\n- No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or anomalies are detected across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, all reports confirm the code is benign and purely configuration.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or mistakes?**  \n  None. The code is standard and correct for its purpose.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the straightforward static configuration.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is justified.\n\n### Critical points:\n- **Any overestimation?**  \n  No. The scores seem appropriate and conservative.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume no malicious intent, which is correct given the code's nature.\n- No hidden or malicious behavior is evident or implied.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (correct)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a benign setup script with no security issues.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe package configuration. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The scores are accurate and justified.",
