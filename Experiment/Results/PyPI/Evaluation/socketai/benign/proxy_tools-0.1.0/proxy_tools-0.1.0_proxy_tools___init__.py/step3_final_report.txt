  "purpose": "A proxy class that forwards all operations to a proxied object, allowing for context-dependent or lazy evaluation of the object.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.version_info for Python version compatibility; accesses attributes and methods of the proxied object.",
  "sinks": "Attribute access, method calls, item access, operator overloading, and other special method invocations on the proxied object.",
  "flows": "Input data (attribute/method calls) are forwarded through the proxy to the underlying object via __getattr__, __setattr__, etc.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; standard use of lambdas for operator overloading; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a well-structured, standard proxy pattern supporting Python 2 and 3. It forwards all operations to the underlying object, which is typical for such utility classes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The proxy could potentially be misused if the underlying object is malicious, but this is a general characteristic of proxies, not a flaw in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard proxy implementation with no malicious intent or malicious code. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the proxy pattern's potential for misuse if the underlying object is malicious, but the code itself is safe.",
