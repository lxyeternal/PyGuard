{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'proxy_tools', used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from variables and imports modules ('os' and 'setuptools'). No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The setup function calls are standard and do not process untrusted data; no sinks for data leakage or malicious code execution are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the script only uses predefined variables and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The script follows typical setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines static configuration data for package setup, including metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic data processing, user inputs, or potentially malicious constructs. The absence of untrusted data handling, code execution, or external data sources indicates a benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
