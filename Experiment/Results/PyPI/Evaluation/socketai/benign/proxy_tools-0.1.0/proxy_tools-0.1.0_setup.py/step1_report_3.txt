  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'proxy_tools'",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data reading beyond standard setup parameters)",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data processing or output points, no data leakage or external communication)",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; standard package setup flow",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script for a Python package. It imports only standard modules ('os' and 'setuptools') and defines package metadata and dependencies. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code does not process external input or produce external outputs that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It appears to be a standard, benign package definition.",
