  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; no network or file I/O involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'os', which is benign but slightly unusual; no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with static package metadata. It imports only standard modules, with 'os' unused. No dynamic input, external data, or malicious behavior is present. The unused import is a minor code cleanliness issue but does not impact security. No obfuscation or malware detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk ~0.1) are appropriate, with the minor securityRisk due to the unused import. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor unused import does not constitute a security risk. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the package can be considered safe for use.",
