{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Python package 'proxy_tools' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package configuration and imports system modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leak points or dangerous operations detected.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from static variable definitions to the setup() function call, no external data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only 'os' and 'setuptools' modules, which are standard. It defines an empty list for required modules and a package list. The setup() function is called with static metadata parameters, such as name, version, description, URL, author info, license, packages, and classifiers. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, nor any code that interacts with external data or performs any risky operations. The code is straightforward and follows standard package setup practices without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is safe for use and deployment.",
