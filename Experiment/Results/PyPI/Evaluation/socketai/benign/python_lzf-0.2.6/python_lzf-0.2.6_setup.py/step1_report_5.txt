  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing a Python C extension package called 'python-lzf'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, description, version, author, url, license) and the list of C source files for compilation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present; the code primarily handles package setup and compilation.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, just package configuration and compilation instructions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard setup procedures; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities from setuptools, defines a package version, and configures the package with metadata and C extension modules. It specifies source files for the extension without dynamic code execution or input processing. The structure is standard for Python C extension packages. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup configuration for compiling a Python C extension module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
