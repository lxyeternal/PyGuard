  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building a Python package with a C extension module named 'lzf'.",
  "sources": "Static source files listed ('lzf_module.c', 'lzf_c.c', 'lzf_d.c') used during compilation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no network or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "The setup process reads static source files and metadata, then compiles the extension without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; all code appears standard and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical static setup script utilizing setuptools to compile a C extension. It contains no dynamic inputs, network activity, or suspicious logic. The source files are local and presumed trusted. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python C extension module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports and their scores accurately reflect the benign nature of this code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
