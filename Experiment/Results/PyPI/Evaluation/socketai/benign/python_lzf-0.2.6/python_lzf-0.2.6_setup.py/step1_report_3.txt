{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for building and installing a Python extension module using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, description, version components, author details, URL, license, and C source files for compilation.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands in this script.",
  "flows": "The script primarily processes static metadata to configure the build process; no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines a package with C extension modules. It specifies metadata, versioning, source files, and compiler arguments. There are no inputs from external sources, nor are there any dynamic or risky operations such as network calls, eval, or system commands. The code adheres to standard practices for building Python C extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for compiling a C extension module and shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
