{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the Stardog Python client, validating database operations, queries, reasoning, schema management, and data validation using local test data files and controlled inputs.",
  "sources": "Reads test data files, environment variables, and inline strings for test data and configuration.",
  "sinks": "Executes database commands, queries, and schema modifications; data flows are confined within the test environment without external or untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Test functions source data from local files or inline strings, perform database operations, and validate responses; no external data or network exfiltration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Exception handling and test assertions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured test suite, performing controlled database interactions, data validation, and exception handling. No malicious payloads, external command execution, or obfuscation are present. Data sources are local files or inline data, and all operations are within a testing context. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, controlled test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate and justified given the nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
