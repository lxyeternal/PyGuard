  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, security risks, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up pytest fixtures for Stardog testing, loads data from URLs/files, and uses environment variables and hardcoded credentials ('admin'/'admin') in some fixtures. No explicit malicious code is present.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 — reflects some security concerns due to hardcoded credentials and insecure SSL options.\n- **Assessment:** The use of external URLs and files could be exploited if sources are malicious, but this is typical in testing. The hardcoded credentials are a security weakness but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring seems appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on environment variables, default credentials, and no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to hardcoded credentials.\n- **Assessment:** No malware, no covert channels, no suspicious code.\n\n**Verdict:** The score aligns with the content. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on configuration and resource setup with environment variables and default credentials.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 — similar concerns as previous reports.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, just insecure practices typical in testing environments.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with environment variables and default credentials, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on configuration and setup, no suspicious code or activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** No malware, no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct; no malicious code or activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to insecure practices (hardcoded credentials, insecure SSL options). These are typical in test environments but are security weaknesses rather than malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's content.\n- No report indicates malicious code or obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores could be slightly increased if considering the insecure practices, but since these are in a testing context, the current scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 — reflecting insecure practices but no malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is standard test setup code with some security weaknesses typical in testing environments, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
