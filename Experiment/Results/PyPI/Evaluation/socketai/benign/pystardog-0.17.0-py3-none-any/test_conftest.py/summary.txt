  "conclusion": "The code is a typical testing setup for Stardog with some insecure practices such as hardcoded credentials and insecure SSL options. There is no evidence of malicious code or malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the content. No modifications are necessary; the code is safe within a testing context but should be improved for security hygiene in production environments."
