  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing suite for Stardog management, with security considerations mainly around credential handling via environment variables and subprocess SSH commands. There is no malicious code or sabotage detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Proper secret management and environment isolation are recommended to mitigate operational risks."
