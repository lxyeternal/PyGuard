  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite for Stardog with no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain attack. Minor security concerns relate to filesystem setup and plaintext credentials, which are typical in testing but should be handled carefully outside controlled environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor setup considerations rather than malicious intent."
