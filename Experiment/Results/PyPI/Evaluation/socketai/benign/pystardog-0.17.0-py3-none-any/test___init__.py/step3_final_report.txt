  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "eval/exec statements, hardcoded URLs/IPs, obfuscated code segments, dynamic code execution, suspicious strings",
  "sinks": "Network communication (sending data, connecting to domains), file operations, environment variable access",
  "flows": "Sources involving eval/exec and hardcoded strings lead to network or file sinks, potential data exfiltration or malicious payload execution",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscated code, hardcoded suspicious strings, dynamic features without clear benign purpose",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits dynamic execution features and obfuscation, which are often used maliciously. No explicit malicious payloads are observed, but the suspicious features justify elevated suspicion. Benign snippets lack anomalies and are straightforward. The scores reflect the evidence, with moderate concern in the suspicious code and minimal risk in benign code.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains some suspicious features such as eval/exec and obfuscation, warranting a moderate malware score of 0.4 and security risk of 0.5. Benign snippets are correctly scored at zero or near-zero. Overall, the code's behavior suggests potential risk but lacks confirmed malicious payloads, so the scores are justified and consistent.",
