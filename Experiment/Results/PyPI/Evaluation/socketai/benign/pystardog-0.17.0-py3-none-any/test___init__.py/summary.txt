  "conclusion": "The dependency contains some suspicious features such as eval/exec and obfuscation, warranting a moderate malware score of 0.4 and security risk of 0.5. Benign snippets are correctly scored at zero or near-zero. Overall, the code's behavior suggests potential risk but lacks confirmed malicious payloads, so the scores are justified and consistent."
