The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and low risk score (~0.2) are consistent with its purpose and implementation. It is safe for use within its testing context."

      "conclusion": "The dependency contains some suspicious features such as eval/exec and obfuscation, warranting a moderate malware score of 0.4 and security risk of 0.5. Benign snippets are correctly scored at zero or near-zero. Overall, the code's behavior suggests potential risk but lacks confirmed malicious payloads, so the scores are justified and consistent."

There is no evidence of malicious code or malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the content. No modifications are necessary; the code is safe within a testing context but should be improved for security hygiene in production environments."

The use of hardcoded credentials poses a minor security risk in production but does not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical test environment concerns."

Minor security concerns relate to filesystem setup and plaintext credentials, which are typical in testing but should be handled carefully outside controlled environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor setup considerations rather than malicious intent."

The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.3 due to insecure handling of secrets. It should be improved by managing credentials more securely, but it does not constitute a supply chain attack or malicious payload."
