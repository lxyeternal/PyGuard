  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cluster management, environment variables, subprocess outputs, admin object methods.\n- **Analysis:** The report states that environment variables are used for SSH credentials, subprocess executes SSH commands, and no malicious code is detected. It notes the security concern of environment variable handling but considers the code standard and purpose-driven.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malware, no obfuscation.  \n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the use of environment variables for sensitive data, but no malicious activity is evident.  \n- The code's logic is straightforward, with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar cluster management functions, environment variables, subprocess, admin methods.\n- **Analysis:** Highlights insecure handling of credentials, subprocess SSH calls, and polling logic. No malicious behavior detected; primarily security concerns about credential handling.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.4. Confidence is 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The security risk score of 0.4 is justified due to insecure credential handling and subprocess execution, but no malware or malicious activity is present.  \n- The logic is standard for administrative scripts.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cluster health check, cache management, environment variables, subprocess with sshpass.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous, with emphasis on insecure credential handling and subprocess execution. No malicious intent detected.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.45. Confidence 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The risk score reflects insecure handling but no malware.  \n- The analysis aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cluster node and cache management, environment variables, subprocess SSH commands.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—security concern over credentials, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3. Confidence 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The risk score is moderate, justified by insecure credential handling but no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cluster management, environment variables, subprocess SSH commands.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to others, no malicious activity, standard cluster management code.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3. Confidence 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.45, justified by insecure handling of credentials via environment variables and subprocess calls, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** Considering the repeated insecure handling of credentials, the potential for exploitation exists, but no active malicious behavior. I would set the overall risk score at **0.3** to reflect the security concern without overestimating the threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are appropriate given the evidence. The main concern is insecure credential handling, which should be addressed but does not constitute malware or malicious intent.\n\n**My final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.3",
