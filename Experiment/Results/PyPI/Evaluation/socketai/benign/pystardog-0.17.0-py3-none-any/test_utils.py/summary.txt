  "conclusion": "The code is a standard administrative utility for cluster management with security flaws in credential handling but no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.3 due to insecure handling of secrets. It should be improved by managing credentials more securely, but it does not constitute a supply chain attack or malicious payload."
