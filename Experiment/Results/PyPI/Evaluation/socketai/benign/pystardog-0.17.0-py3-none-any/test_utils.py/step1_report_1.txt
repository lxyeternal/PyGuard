  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for managing and monitoring a cluster, particularly involving SSH connections and cache management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SSH_USER, SSH_PASS, STARDOG_HOSTNAME_NODE_1, STARDOG_HOSTNAME_STANDBY), subprocess output from sshpass/ssh commands, admin object methods (cluster_info, cache_targets).",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess commands with potentially untrusted environment variables, printing debug information, raising exceptions upon timeouts.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used to construct SSH commands, which retrieve node IPs. The retrieved IPs are used in admin cluster info checks. Errors and retries are logged via print and exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for SSH credentials can pose security risks if environment is compromised. No encryption or secure handling of secrets is evident beyond environment variable use. No code obfuscation or obfuscated techniques detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads sensitive data from environment variables for SSH credentials and cluster node hostnames, which is typical but should be managed securely. It uses subprocess to execute SSH commands to retrieve node IPs, which could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously set. The functions rely on retries with sleep for cluster state synchronization, which is standard for cluster management scripts. No suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident. The code primarily manages cluster state with control flow and exception handling. All external inputs are from environment variables or method calls; no user input or untrusted data processing is involved. The overall logic is consistent with legitimate cluster management utilities, and no malware or malicious behavior is identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard cluster management utility that handles SSH connections and cluster state monitoring. It uses environment variables for sensitive information, which should be managed securely but is not inherently malicious. No malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious anomalies are detected. The risk is low; the code is straightforward and purpose-driven.",
