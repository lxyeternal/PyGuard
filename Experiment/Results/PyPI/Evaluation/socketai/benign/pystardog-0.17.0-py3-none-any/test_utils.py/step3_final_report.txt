  "purpose": "Utility functions for cluster management, involving SSH connections and cache monitoring, primarily using environment variables for credentials and subprocess calls.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for SSH credentials and hostnames, subprocess calls executing SSH commands, admin object methods for cluster info and cache targets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or command injection through subprocess calls if environment variables are compromised; reading environment variables as input.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide credentials to subprocess commands; subprocess outputs are processed; admin methods query cluster state; no external untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive credentials, subprocess with sshpass without validation, no input sanitization, no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs cluster management tasks via SSH and API calls, relying on environment variables for credentials, which poses security risks if environment is compromised. No malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors are present. The use of subprocess with sshpass is insecure but standard in administrative scripts. No obfuscation or malware signatures are found. The security risk stems from insecure credential handling rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard administrative utility for cluster management with security flaws in credential handling but no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.3 due to insecure handling of secrets. It should be improved by managing credentials more securely, but it does not constitute a supply chain attack or malicious payload.",
