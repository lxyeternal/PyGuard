  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cluster management, primarily using environment variables for SSH credentials, subprocess for SSH commands, and admin object methods.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code detected. Use of environment variables for secrets is common but insecure if environment is compromised. No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate cluster management utility; low risk, no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to insecure handling but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar cluster management with SSH and admin API calls.\n- **Analysis:** Same concerns—use of environment variables for credentials, subprocess with sshpass, insecure handling. No malicious intent or code.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard admin code, security flaws but no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.4 (moderate, due to insecure credential handling)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cluster health checks, cache management, SSH via sshpass.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—credentials in environment variables, subprocess SSH calls, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Administrative script with security concerns but no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.45 (similar to previous, insecure but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cluster node and cache target management, similar pattern.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, just insecure handling of credentials and subprocess execution.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard admin code, security risk but no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.3 (lower than previous, perhaps slightly less insecure)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—cluster management via SSH and admin API.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, just insecure credential handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate management script, no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.3\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is standard cluster management code, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Security concerns:** Repeatedly noted—use of environment variables for sensitive data, subprocess calls with sshpass, insecure handling—but these are typical for administrative scripts, not malicious code.\n- **Malware assessment:** All reports assign malware score 0, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected, scores are 0.\n- **Risk scores:** They vary between 0.2 and 0.45, reflecting insecure handling but no malicious intent.\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 — moderate due to insecure handling of credentials, but no active exploitation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe code is a standard cluster management utility with security flaws related to credential handling but no evidence of supply chain malware or malicious payloads. The risk is primarily from insecure practices, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.3\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the detailed analysis.",
