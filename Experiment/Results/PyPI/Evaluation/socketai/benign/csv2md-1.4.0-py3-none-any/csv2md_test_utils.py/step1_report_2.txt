  "purpose": "Unit test for the function 'column_letter' imported from utils module.",
  "sources": "Input comes from test assertions; specifically, the integer arguments passed to 'column_letter'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external system interactions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input integers (0, 4, 30) flow into 'column_letter' function; no data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard unit test code with no unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a unit test class using Python's unittest framework to verify the behavior of 'column_letter'. The tests check expected output for specific inputs. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The import path '.utils' suggests a relative import, typical for a package structure, with no indications of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a normal test case with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard unit test for a utility function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a Python testing environment.",
