  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'column_letter' function from the utils module",
  "sources": "Input data comes from test assertions on the 'column_letter' function calls",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data are present",
  "flows": "Test inputs flow into the 'column_letter' function, with no data leak or external effect",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test using Python's unittest framework. It tests the 'column_letter' function with specific inputs and expected outputs. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious behavior are observed. The test structure is standard, and no external or untrusted data handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and solely intended for validation of the utility function.",
