{
  "purpose": "Unit test for the utility function 'column_letter' in the utils module",
  "sources": "Input is derived from function parameters (integers passed to 'column_letter') and imported modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is written to external systems or files, and no untrusted data is processed in a risky manner",
  "flows": "Input integers flow into 'column_letter' function; no data flows to any sensitive or external destinations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and a utility function, then defines a simple test case to verify the correctness of 'column_letter'. The test checks specific mappings from integers to column labels. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity. It is a standard unit test structure, and no external network, file, or sensitive data handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for a utility function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic validation of the function's output and does not involve any risky operations.",
