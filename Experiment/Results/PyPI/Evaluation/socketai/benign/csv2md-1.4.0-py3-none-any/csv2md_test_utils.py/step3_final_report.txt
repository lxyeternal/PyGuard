  "purpose": "Unit test for the function 'column_letter' to verify correct conversion of numeric indices to column labels.",
  "sources": "Input data: hardcoded integers (0, 4, 30) used as arguments to 'column_letter'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external system interactions; the code only performs assertions within the test framework.",
  "flows": "Input integers flow into 'column_letter' function, which returns string labels; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard unit test verifying the output of 'column_letter' for specific inputs. No malicious code, data leaks, or external interactions are present. The function appears to convert integers to Excel-like column labels, which is benign. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence (1), and assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The structure and content do not suggest any security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
