{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Table class to verify CSV parsing and Markdown table rendering functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads from predefined CSV string literals and creates Table objects.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only static data used within tests.",
  "flows": "Input CSV strings are parsed into cells and widths; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors; code solely for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a test suite utilizing static CSV data to validate the behavior of the Table class methods. It does not process untrusted input from external sources or user inputs. The tests focus on parsing CSV data, generating Markdown tables, and handling various configurations like alignment and column selection. The code appears standard and free of malicious constructs. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. It is a controlled testing environment designed for validation, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests for the Table class, employing static, controlled test data. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
