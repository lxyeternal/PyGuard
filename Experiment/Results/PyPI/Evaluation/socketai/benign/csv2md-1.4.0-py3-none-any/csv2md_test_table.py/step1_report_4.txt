{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the Table class, focusing on parsing CSV data and generating Markdown table representations.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from CSV strings (normal_csv, normal_csv_with_custom_delimiter), hardcoded test data structures (cells, widths, expected markdown strings).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network, file I/O, or environment variable usage are present. No data is sent or stored externally.",
  "flows": "The tests call static methods like Table.parse_csv() with CSV input, then instantiate Table objects, and generate Markdown output. No untrusted data flows into insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code strictly pertains to data parsing and formatting. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing for a CSV-to-Markdown table conversion. All data appears to be static test data, and no external data sources, network connections, or environment manipulations are involved. The functions are standard and straightforward, focusing solely on data processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code uses conventional Python testing practices with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of unit tests for the Table class, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include network operations, credential handling, or other indicators of malicious activity.",
