  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to column identifiers.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and __init__ method that constructs an error message.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(msg) which passes the message to the base Exception class.",
  "flows": "The constructor creates a message from input and passes it to the base class, which could display or log it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code. No unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, inheriting from Exception. The ColumnIdentifierError constructor takes a column parameter, constructs an error message, and passes it to the Exception base class. The message construction appears straightforward and intended for debugging or user notification. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is present. The code is simple, clear, and adheres to standard Python practices for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign and standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase, likely for input validation or error reporting.",
