  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to column identifiers.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no suspicious logic, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and BaseError. The ColumnIdentifierError class formats an error message based on a provided column parameter. No input reading, data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for exception handling, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
