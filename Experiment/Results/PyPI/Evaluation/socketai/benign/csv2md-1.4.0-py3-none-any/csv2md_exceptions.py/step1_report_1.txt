  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to column identification.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink exists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes: BaseError and ColumnIdentifierError. The ColumnIdentifierError constructs an error message based on a column parameter, indicating invalid column identifiers. The implementation uses standard Python class inheritance and string formatting without external data sources, unsafe operations, or malicious constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
