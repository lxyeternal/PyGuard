  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to column identifiers.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and BaseError, used for error handling. The ColumnIdentifierError constructor formats an error message with a provided column parameter, but it does not perform any data processing, I/O, or network operations. The class design is straightforward, and no suspicious behavior, such as malicious code or hidden backdoors, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely sets up custom exceptions for input validation or error handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
