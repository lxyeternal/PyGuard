  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to column identifiers.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only the 'column' parameter used in the constructor for message formatting.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input (column parameter) flows into message construction, then into exception raising; no external flows or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple exception classes. 'ColumnIdentifierError' constructs an error message using the 'column' parameter, which is used solely for messaging. There are no external data reads, network operations, or security-sensitive operations. The code is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and confidence of 1. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these scores. No issues or vulnerabilities are present, and the code aligns with typical Python error handling patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
