  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines two classes: `BaseError` (inherits from `Exception`) and `ColumnIdentifierError` (inherits from `BaseError`).\n- `ColumnIdentifierError`'s constructor constructs an error message based on a `column` parameter, indicating invalid column identifiers, and passes it to the superclass.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues Reported:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes.\n- No external data reading, processing, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The `column` parameter is used solely for message formatting, not for data manipulation or security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code.** The code is straightforward, harmless, and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They emphasize the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- They correctly note that the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.\n\n**Note:**  \nThe reports are comprehensive and do not contain logical flaws or misinterpretations.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\nThese are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo score adjustments are necessary. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious or security-sensitive operations, **risk scores should remain at 0**.\n- The only potential concern could be if `column` is sourced from untrusted input, but since this code only defines the class, not its usage, it does not pose a risk.\n\n**Therefore:**  \n- `malware`: 0  \n- `securityRisk`: 0  \n- `obfuscated`: 0\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- No claims in the reports are based on unwarranted assumptions.\n- All assessments are cautious and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code snippet is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- No score adjustments are needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep all scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
