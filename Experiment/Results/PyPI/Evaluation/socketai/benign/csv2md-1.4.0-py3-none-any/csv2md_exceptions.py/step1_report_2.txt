  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to column identification errors.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of ColumnIdentifierError with a column parameter, which may originate from user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows or external communications present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and a method to generate error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward class inheritance for custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, BaseError and ColumnIdentifierError. ColumnIdentifierError generates an error message based on an input parameter 'column', intended to indicate invalid column identifiers. There are no external data reads, no network operations, no cryptic or malicious code, and no suspicious logic. The classes are typical for error handling and do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions for handling specific errors related to column identifiers. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscated code. It appears to be standard, harmless Python code for error management.",
