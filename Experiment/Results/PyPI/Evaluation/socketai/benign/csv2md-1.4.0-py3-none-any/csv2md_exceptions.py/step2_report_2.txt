  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code snippet is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes: `BaseError` and `ColumnIdentifierError`.\n- The `ColumnIdentifierError` constructor formats an error message using the provided `column` parameter and passes it to the base `Exception`.\n- There are no external data reads, network operations, or data processing.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues or malicious activity are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, simple, and harmless.\n- They correctly note that the `column` parameter is used solely for message formatting.\n- No report points out any logical flaws or security concerns.\n- No report suggests that the code performs any risky operations or contains hidden malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned in the reports**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n- These scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code only defines exception classes with no external input, processing, or malicious intent, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n- The code does not pose any security threat or vulnerability.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n- All reports assign malware score 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n- The only potential concern is if `column` input comes from untrusted sources, but since this is just class definition, that concern is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of custom exception classes.  \n- No external data, network activity, or obfuscation.  \n- No security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as harmless. The scores are justified and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
