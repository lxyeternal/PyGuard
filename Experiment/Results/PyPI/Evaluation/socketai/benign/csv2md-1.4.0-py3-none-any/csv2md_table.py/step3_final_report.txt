  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for parsing CSV files and generating markdown tables with customizable alignment, intended for data presentation.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV data via csv.reader, possibly from external files or streams.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted markdown text; no data is transmitted or executed.",
  "flows": "CSV input -> parsing in parse_csv -> data stored in Table -> markdown output generated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries to parse CSV data and format markdown tables. It does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or environment manipulation. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The functions are simple, with clear logic. The CSV input could be crafted maliciously (e.g., CSV injection), but the code does not process or interpret content beyond formatting. The security implications are minimal, and the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for CSV parsing and markdown formatting with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal threat. No modifications are necessary.",
