{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling tables, including parsing CSV files and formatting tables in Markdown.",
  "sources": "Reads data from CSV files via the csv.reader() function.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed into table structures and formatted as Markdown; no external data sinks or network connections are involved.",
  "flows": "CSV input data flows from csv.reader() into the Table.parse_csv method, then into internal processing, and finally output as Markdown string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard CSV reading and Markdown table formatting. It includes functions for calculating column widths and creating table structures. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are detected. The only external library used is 'csv', which is standard and safe. The parsing method includes optional column selection, which is benign. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward utility code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for CSV parsing and Markdown formatting with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates within normal bounds for such functions.",
