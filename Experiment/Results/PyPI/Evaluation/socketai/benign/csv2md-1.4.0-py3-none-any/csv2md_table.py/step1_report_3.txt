{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Table class to process, format, and parse CSV data into markdown table format, with utility functions for widths and default headers.",
  "sources": "Data is read from a CSV file object via the csv.reader, and from input parameters such as 'columns' and 'file'.",
  "sinks": "Data is primarily processed internally; output is generated as markdown-formatted string. No external data sinks or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from csv.reader input to the cells list, then through formatting functions, potentially filtered by 'columns' parameter, and output as markdown string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward data processing methods.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the csv module for CSV parsing, defines a Table class with methods for markdown formatting and CSV parsing, and utility functions for widths and headers. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors observed. The CSV parsing is straightforward, with optional column filtering, and markdown formatting is standard. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard CSV-to-markdown table formatter and parser with no malicious or suspicious features. It securely processes CSV data for display purposes without external communication or harmful logic.",
