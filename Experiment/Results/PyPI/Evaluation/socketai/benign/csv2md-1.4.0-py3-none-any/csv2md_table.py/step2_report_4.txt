  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Functionality:**\n   - The code provides CSV parsing and markdown table formatting.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or environment variable usage.\n   - It reads CSV data via the standard `csv.reader` and formats it into markdown tables with alignment options.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The code is straightforward and uses standard Python libraries.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns:**\n   - The only potential concern is if untrusted CSV input contains malicious content. However, the code does not execute or interpret CSV content beyond formatting.\n   - Markdown output could be malicious if rendered in an unsafe environment (e.g., XSS in a web app), but this is outside the scope of the code itself.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n   - **Risk Score:** Very low (around 0.1-0.2), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Analysis of Reported Anomalies or Flaws:**\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as standard utility functions.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - The scores seem consistent with the code’s benign nature.\n   - The highest risk score is 0.2, which is reasonable given minimal potential for misuse.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is safe, straightforward, and free from malicious intent.\n   - No signs of supply chain security issues or vulnerabilities.\n   - The only concern might be how the markdown output is used downstream, but that is outside the scope of this code.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (appropriate, given minimal risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code is a benign utility with no security issues.",
