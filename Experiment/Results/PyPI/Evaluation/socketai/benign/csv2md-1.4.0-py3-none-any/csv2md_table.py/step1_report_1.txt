{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities to parse CSV files and generate markdown table representations with customizable alignment options.",
  "sources": "The code reads CSV data via the csv.reader, which reads from file-like objects, and accesses data within these objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; the code formats and outputs markdown text, which could be used maliciously if the content is untrusted, but no direct malicious sink exists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV file reading into internal cell data structures, then into markdown formatting functions that generate text output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or suspicious hardcoded data are present. No dynamic execution, network calls, or environment variable use are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for CSV parsing and markdown table generation. It reads CSV data via the csv.reader, processes the data into cells, and formats output with alignment options. The methods use standard Python features without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. No external data sources or sinks are invoked other than reading files and returning text outputs. The code does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing solely on data formatting and CSV parsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code inclusion. It is safe from a security perspective.",
