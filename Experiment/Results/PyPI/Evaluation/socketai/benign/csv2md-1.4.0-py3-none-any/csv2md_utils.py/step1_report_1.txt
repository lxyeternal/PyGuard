  "purpose": "Generate Excel-style column letters based on a numerical index.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'index' to the function 'column_letter'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing the column letter string.",
  "flows": "Input 'index' → Function logic → Output string of column letter.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external calls, no obfuscation, straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The function takes an integer 'index' and converts it into a repeated sequence of lowercase alphabet characters, cycling through 'a' to 'z'. It does not involve external data, system calls, or potentially dangerous operations. The implementation appears to generate repeated letters for indices beyond 25, which is a simplistic approach and does not conform to standard Excel column naming conventions (e.g., 'aa', 'ab', etc.), but this is not malicious. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign function to produce repeated lowercase alphabet characters based on an index. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
