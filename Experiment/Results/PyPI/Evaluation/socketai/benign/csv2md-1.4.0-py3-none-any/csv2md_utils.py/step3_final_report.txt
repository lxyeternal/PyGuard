  "purpose": "Generate Excel column labels based on an index by repeating a lowercase letter.",
  "sources": "Input: integer index parameter; Data source: string.ascii_lowercase",
  "sinks": "Return value: repeated lowercase letter string; No external data or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Input index -> modulo/division calculations -> repeated letter string -> output",
  "anomalies": "Repeats a single letter for indices beyond 25, does not produce standard Excel labels; no malicious or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code takes an integer index, uses string.ascii_lowercase to select a letter, and repeats it based on the index. It does not generate proper Excel column labels but produces a simple pattern. No external calls, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior are present. The implementation is straightforward, deterministic, and safe. The main issue is functional correctness for Excel labels, not security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It produces a simplistic pattern of repeated characters, which does not conform to Excel standards but is not harmful. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.",
