{
  "purpose": "The function 'column_letter' converts an integer index into an Excel-style column letter, repeating letters as necessary.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'index' parameter passed to 'column_letter'. It also reads 'string.ascii_lowercase' from the standard library.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code where untrusted data is processed further or where data is leaked or executed.",
  "flows": "Input 'index' flows through the modulo and division operations to generate repeated letter patterns, but no external data or untrusted sources influence this flow beyond the function input.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs. The use of string.ascii_lowercase and basic arithmetic is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the string module, then defines a function to convert an integer index into an Excel column label. It calculates the column letter by repeating a single lowercase letter based on the index modulo 26, and repeats the letter for each 26-step increment. There is no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic. The code performs a simple, deterministic transformation with no evident malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function to generate Excel column labels from an index. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
