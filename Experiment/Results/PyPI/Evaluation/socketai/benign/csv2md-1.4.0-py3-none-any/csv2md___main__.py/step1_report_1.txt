{
  "purpose": "This script parses CSV files and converts them into Markdown table format, providing options for delimiters, quote characters, column selection, and alignment.",
  "sources": "Input CSV files or standard input (sys.stdin), user-supplied command-line arguments for delimiters, quote characters, column indices, and flags.",
  "sinks": "Printing the resulting Markdown table to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input files and command-line arguments are read as sources; parsed CSV data flows into Table.parse_csv; the formatted Markdown table flows into the print function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code uses standard libraries and simple parsing logic without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles command-line argument parsing, CSV reading, and formatting output. It uses a local import of Table and exception classes, which are not provided but assumed to be standard for CSV processing. The parse_columns function safely interprets user input for column selection, with validation and error handling via custom exceptions. No code injection, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The code relies on standard input/output streams and local modules, with no external connections or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CSV-to-Markdown converter script with no malicious intent. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code's security risk score is very low.",
