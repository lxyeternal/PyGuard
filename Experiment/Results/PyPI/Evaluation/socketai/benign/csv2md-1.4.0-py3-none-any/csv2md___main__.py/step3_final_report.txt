  "purpose": "A command-line utility that parses CSV files and outputs Markdown tables with customizable options for delimiters, quotes, columns, and alignment.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV data from specified files or stdin, processes user options for columns and formatting.",
  "sinks": "Outputs Markdown-formatted tables to stdout; no untrusted data sinks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input CSV data → parsing via Table.parse_csv → formatting with markdown() → output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CSV parser and formatter with standard argument handling. It relies on local modules (.table, .exceptions) assumed benign. No network activity, code injection, or data leaks are present. Input validation in parse_columns is proper, and error handling is in place. The logic is simple and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CSV to Markdown converter with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate; however, given the benign nature, securityRisk can be confidently set to 0. The code does not pose any security threat.",
