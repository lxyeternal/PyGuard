  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CSV to Markdown converter.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and local modules (.table, .exceptions), which are assumed benign.\n- The only potential concern might be the handling of user input for column ranges, but the code validates and sanitizes this input appropriately.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature of the script. No malware or suspicious activity is evident.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Justification:** The report confirms the script is a standard utility with no malicious intent. The security risk could be zero, but a small buffer (0.1) is acceptable for conservative reasons.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning as above; the script is benign.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, network activity, or code injection detected.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Justification:** Same as others; very low risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malware, obfuscated code, or malicious activity. I agree with a malware score of **0** across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk scores:** Given the benign nature, a score of **0** would be ideal. However, since the reports assign 0.1 in some cases, I believe a conservative approach is acceptable, but it should be **0** for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard CSV to Markdown converter with no malicious or security concerns. The scores should all be zero, reflecting the absence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways verify the contents of the local modules (`.table`, `.exceptions`) to ensure they are safe, but based on the provided code and reports, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
