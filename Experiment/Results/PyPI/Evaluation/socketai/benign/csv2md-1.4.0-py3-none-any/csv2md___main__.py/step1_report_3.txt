  "purpose": "Command-line utility to parse CSV files and convert them into Markdown table format with configurable options.",
  "sources": "Input CSV files provided via command-line arguments or standard input.",
  "sinks": "Prints the resulting Markdown table to standard output.",
  "flows": "Reads CSV data from files or stdin; processes command-line options; creates Table object; outputs Markdown representation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. No network activity, no hidden backdoors or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool that parses CSV files into Markdown tables. It uses standard libraries (argparse, sys) and custom modules (.table, .exceptions). The 'parse_columns' function handles input parsing for column selection, with proper exception handling. The script processes input files or stdin, constructs a Table object, and outputs Markdown. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity. The structure and flow are typical for CLI utilities. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign CSV-to-Markdown converter with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected input/output operations and proper error handling without any suspicious or malicious activities.",
