{
  "purpose": "This script parses CSV files and converts them into Markdown tables with customizable formatting options.",
  "sources": "Input CSV files (via command line arguments or stdin), command-line arguments for delimiter, quote character, column selection, and alignment options.",
  "sinks": "The parsed CSV data used in Table.parse_csv and table.markdown functions, and output via print statements.",
  "flows": "Input data from files or stdin flows into Table.parse_csv; user-supplied parameters influence parsing and formatting; output flows to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No unsafe code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI tool for CSV to Markdown conversion. It accepts user input, processes CSV files with specified delimiters and quote characters, and handles column selection and alignment options. It performs input parsing and error handling through custom exceptions. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no data leakage or privacy violations detected. Usage of internal modules (.table, .exceptions) is typical for modular code but should be verified separately for malicious content. Overall, the code appears straightforward and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CSV processing script with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected parsing and formatting functions safely. No security risks or malware indicators were found.",
