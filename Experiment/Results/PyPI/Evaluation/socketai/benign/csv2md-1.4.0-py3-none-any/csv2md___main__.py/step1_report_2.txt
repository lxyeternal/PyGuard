{
  "purpose": "The script parses CSV files and converts them into Markdown tables, allowing customization of delimiters, quote characters, and column formatting.",
  "sources": "Input CSV files specified via command-line arguments or stdin; command-line arguments for delimiters, quote characters, column indices, and formatting options.",
  "sinks": "The only output is printed to stdout. No data is sent over the network or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input files and command-line arguments are processed to parse CSV data, then output is generated as Markdown tables without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no use of system secrets, and no obfuscated code detected. No dynamic execution, eval, or system calls that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and local modules, sets up argument parsing with various options, and processes CSV files either from provided files or stdin. It includes input validation and error handling via custom exceptions. The core logic involves reading CSV data and formatting it as Markdown tables, with options for column alignment and header presence. No network activity, file manipulation beyond reading, or hidden behaviors are present. The parse_columns function safely interprets user input for column ranges. The code appears to be a standard utility script for CSV to Markdown conversion, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CSV parsing and formatting utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It handles input safely, provides useful features, and does not perform any harmful actions or communicate externally.",
