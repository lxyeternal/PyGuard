  "purpose": "Parse CSV files and convert them into Markdown tables with configurable options for delimiters, headers, and column alignment.",
  "sources": "Input CSV files provided via command line arguments or standard input; command-line arguments for delimiter, quote character, column specifications, and alignment options.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (print of Markdown table). No untrusted data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "CSV file input -> parse_csv method in Table class -> generate Markdown -> print to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line arguments to process CSV files into Markdown format, using standard input or specified files. It handles column range specifications and alignment options. Error handling is limited to argument parsing errors. No code reads or writes sensitive information, nor does it perform network operations or system modifications. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility with no malicious intent or malicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CSV parsing CLI utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates locally, processing data solely for output formatting. No security concerns are identified.",
