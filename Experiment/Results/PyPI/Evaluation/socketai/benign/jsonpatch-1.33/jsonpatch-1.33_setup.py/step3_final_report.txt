  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'jsonpatch' Python module, extracting metadata and dependencies from local files, and configuring package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'jsonpatch.py' for metadata, 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, 'README.md' for long description, and local files for version and author info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network operations or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Metadata extraction from local files; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: reading local files for metadata, handling optional modules ('setuptools', 'pypandoc'), and configuring setup(). No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing is present. The regex-based metadata extraction is safe. The optional import of 'pypandoc' is benign. Overall, the script is a standard, benign setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
