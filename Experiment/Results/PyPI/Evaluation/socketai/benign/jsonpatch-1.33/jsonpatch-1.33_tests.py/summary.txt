  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured test suite for 'jsonpatch' with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.2), justified by external file handling in tests but no actual threats."
