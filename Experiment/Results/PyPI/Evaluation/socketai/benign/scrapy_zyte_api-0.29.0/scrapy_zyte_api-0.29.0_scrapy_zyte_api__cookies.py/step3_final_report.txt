  "purpose": "Manage cookies by extracting, setting, and storing them in cookie jars during web scraping operations.",
  "sources": "API response's 'experimental.responseCookies' and request meta 'cookiejar' ID.",
  "sinks": "CookieJar's set_cookie method, storing cookies with domain and attribute details.",
  "flows": "Extract response cookies -> process attributes -> create Cookie objects -> store in CookieJar.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard cookie handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cookie management tasks using Python's http.cookiejar and Scrapy. It extracts cookies from API responses, assigns domains based on response or URL, and stores cookies with appropriate attributes. No malicious, suspicious, or obfuscated code is present. The logic is straightforward, with proper handling of cookie attributes and error cases. No network activity beyond cookie storage is observed. The code aligns with best practices, and the absence of malicious behavior is consistent across all reports. The security risk and malware scores are justified as zero or very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of cookie management in a web scraping context. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is minimal. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
