  "purpose": "Manage and process cookies within HTTP requests and responses, integrating with Scrapy's cookie management system.",
  "sources": "Request meta data (cookiejar ID), API response headers (responseCookies), URL parsing for domain extraction.",
  "sinks": "Cookie creation and setting via CookieJar, potential modification or injection of cookies.",
  "flows": "API response -> cookie processing -> cookie creation -> CookieJar update.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code constructs. Usage of standard cookie handling practices.",
  "analysis": "The code handles cookies by extracting cookies from API responses, managing cookie jars, and ensuring cookies have proper domains and attributes. It uses standard Python libraries and Scrapy components without suspicious or malicious logic. There are no indicators of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious data manipulation. The logic appears to be straightforward cookie management with appropriate validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a cookie management utility within a web scraping context, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles cookies responsibly and transparently without any suspicious behavior.",
