{
  "purpose": "The code processes Zyte API responses, decoding base64 response bodies, handling cookies and headers, and converting data into Scrapy Response objects.",
  "sources": "Response bodies from 'httpResponseBody', cookies from 'responseCookies', headers from 'httpResponseHeaders' in the API response.",
  "sinks": "Creation of Response or HtmlResponse objects, header and cookie processing functions.",
  "flows": "Decoding base64 bodies from API response → processing cookies into headers → constructing response objects with headers and body.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard response handling: decoding base64-encoded response bodies, processing cookies into header strings, sanitizing headers by removing 'content-encoding' and 'set-cookie' when appropriate, and constructing Scrapy Response objects. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation patterns are present. The operations are typical for web response processing, with no external network activity or security vulnerabilities evident. The decoding of untrusted data is inherent to response handling but not malicious. The code adheres to best practices and uses standard libraries and patterns, indicating a low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation for handling Zyte API responses. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The response decoding and header processing are typical and controlled. The overall security posture is very low risk, with scores accurately reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
