  "purpose": "Configuration script for Scrapy and Zyte API, managing retry policies, middlewares, and handlers.",
  "sources": "Settings retrieval and modification, dynamic class loading via load_object, import statements for optional modules.",
  "sinks": "Download handlers, middleware settings, retry policies, and request fingerprinting classes.",
  "flows": "Source data (settings and class paths) flow into setting modifications and middleware configurations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of load_object with strings for class paths due to pickle limitations; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration setup for integrating Zyte API with Scrapy, utilizing dynamic class loading to handle plugin classes. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The use of load_object is a known pattern to avoid pickling issues and is not inherently malicious. The code's structure is straightforward, with conditional imports and setting adjustments typical for such plugins. The potential risk lies in external manipulation of configuration strings, but in this context, all strings appear controlled and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured configuration script for Scrapy and Zyte API integration. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor risk score reflects the inherent caution with dynamic class loading, but overall, the code is safe.",
