{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package related to web scraping or API interaction, providing middleware, session management, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (._utils, ._annotations, ._middlewares, etc.), environment or external configurations (e.g., install_reactor based on _NEEDS_EARLY_REACTOR).",
  "sinks": "Function calls like install_reactor, variable assignments of retry policies, and session configurations could potentially be affected by external inputs, but no direct untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "flows": "Conditional import based on _NEEDS_EARLY_REACTOR leads to calling install_reactor; other variables and functions are assigned or re-exported; no external untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious API calls, is present. The conditional import is standard for configuring asynchronous reactors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of importing modules, configuring session policies, and setting up exports. The conditional reactor installation based on _NEEDS_EARLY_REACTOR is a standard pattern for asynchronous setup. All variables are sourced from internal modules or constants. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. No external data is read directly, and no unsafe operations are performed. Overall, the code appears to be standard configuration and setup code for a web scraping framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard setup code for a web scraping or API interaction package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. No indicators of malware or obfuscation are present. The security risk is minimal, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
