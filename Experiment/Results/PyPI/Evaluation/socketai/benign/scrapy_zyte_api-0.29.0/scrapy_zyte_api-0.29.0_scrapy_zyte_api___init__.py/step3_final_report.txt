{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a configuration and setup module for a web scraping or API client library, managing imports, environment setup, and exporting key variables and classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional reactor installation based on _NEEDS_EARLY_REACTOR, variable definitions, and module exports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user inputs; no external network calls or data leaks; no execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Imports and conditional reactor setup occur at module load; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard setup pattern with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup module for an asynchronous web scraping framework, with conditional reactor installation and module exports. It contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. The conditional reactor setup is a common pattern and does not indicate malicious intent. No external data handling or network activity is present. The code's structure and purpose are benign, and the lack of suspicious patterns supports this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard configuration code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports—malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.1)—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
