  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines data structures (Enums, TypedDicts) for actions, selectors, extraction sources.\n- Implements utility functions (`make_hashable`, `_from_hashable`, `actions`, `custom_attrs`) to convert complex data into hashable forms and back.\n- No system calls, network operations, or data exfiltration.\n- Functions are straightforward, serving data normalization, deduplication, or comparison purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms benign utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; utility functions for data handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence (0.95), mentions \"no signs of malicious behavior\" and \"safe data transformations.\"\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly conservative but reasonable; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; benign data handling code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis & Justification\n\n- **Presence of malware or malicious code?**  \n  None of the code snippets contain any suspicious operations, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The functions are straightforward data transformations.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. The securityRisk scores are minimal, reflecting no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Potential assumptions or vulnerabilities?**  \n  The functions handle untrusted data but do not execute or transmit it. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.\n\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns?**  \n  No. The code is clear and well-structured.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.**  \n- The malware scores should remain at 0, as there's no malicious code.  \n- Security risk scores are appropriately low, given the benign nature.  \n- Confidence levels are justified based on the thorough reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Estimation\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated code:** **0**  \n**Security risk:** **0** (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.05, but 0 is acceptable)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard utility module for data normalization and handling in web scraping or automation contexts. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always monitor for future updates or integrations, but based on current analysis, the code is safe.",
