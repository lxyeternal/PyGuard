{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures, enums, and utility functions for handling actions and extraction sources, likely within a web scraping or automation framework.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (`input`, `options`, `value`), possibly external data passed into these functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the functions are primarily for data transformation and normalization. No untrusted data is being written or executed.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed into functions (`custom_attrs`, `actions`) which convert them into hashable forms, then back to original forms. No execution or network operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions (`make_hashable`, `_from_hashable`) to convert complex data structures into hashable types and vice versa. These are used in `actions` to process iterable of action dicts into tuples, likely for deduplication or comparison. The `custom_attrs` function wraps input data and options into hashable, immutable forms. There are no indications of data leakage, unsafe operations, or malicious intent. The functions do not perform I/O, network requests, or system modifications. All code appears standard and intended for data normalization and handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and primarily provides data transformation utilities without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks. No evidence of supply chain attack or sabotage is found.",
