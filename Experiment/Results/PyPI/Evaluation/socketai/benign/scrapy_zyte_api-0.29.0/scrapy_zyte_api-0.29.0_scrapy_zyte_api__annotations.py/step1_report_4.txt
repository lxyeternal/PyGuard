{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures, enums, and utility functions for handling actions and extracting data, likely in a web scraping or automation context.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources; functions operate on provided data structures. No external data reads evident.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; functions process data internally without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input data (dicts, iterables) is transformed into hashable types and back, with no external data flow or output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious patterns; functions are straightforward and do not perform malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily offers utility functions for making data hashable and handling actions and attributes in a structured manner. It uses type annotations and TypedDicts for clarity. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The make_hashable and _from_hashable functions are safe data transformations. The code does not execute external commands, handle secrets, or perform any suspicious operations. No obfuscated code or malware-like patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for data structure management, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is typical for API or data processing layers in web scraping or automation tools.",
