  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting complex data structures into hashable forms and reconstructing them, primarily for data normalization and deduplication.",
  "sources": "Data inputs for make_hashable and _from_hashable functions, including dictionaries, lists, tuples, and nested structures.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs; functions process data internally without external I/O.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed by make_hashable to produce hashable representations; _from_hashable reverses this process, enabling consistent data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward data transformation functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and utility functions focused on making data hashable and reconstructing it. It does not perform any system calls, network operations, or handle secrets. The functions are simple, safe, and serve data normalization purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data normalization, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are appropriate and do not require adjustments.",
