  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its functionality, and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of data structure definitions (Enums, TypedDicts) and utility functions (`make_hashable`, `_from_hashable`, `actions`, `custom_attrs`).\n- These functions perform data normalization, primarily converting complex data structures into hashable forms and vice versa.\n- No external system calls, network operations, file I/O, or execution of untrusted code are present.\n- The functions are straightforward, with clear purposes related to data handling, deduplication, or caching.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious patterns, secrets, or backdoors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities:** No, the code appears benign.\n- **Code correctness:** The functions are logically consistent, and their purpose is clear.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are apparent; the functions are simple data transformations.\n- **Malware indicators:** None; no malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Supply chain attack signs:** No evidence of malicious dependencies or code injection.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n\n- **None identified.** The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very close (0.1). Given the benign nature, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n\n- None needed; the code is benign and safe.\n\n### Consistency:\n\n- All reports are consistent with each other, correctly identifying the code as safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert evaluation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n\n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code is utility in nature, used for data normalization and handling in web scraping or automation contexts.\n- No suspicious patterns, data exfiltration, or malicious intent are present.\n- The functions could be part of a larger framework, but on their own, they are safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Confirmed issues:** None.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate; no change needed.\n- **Risk justification:** Not applicable; the code is benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current assessments are accurate. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
