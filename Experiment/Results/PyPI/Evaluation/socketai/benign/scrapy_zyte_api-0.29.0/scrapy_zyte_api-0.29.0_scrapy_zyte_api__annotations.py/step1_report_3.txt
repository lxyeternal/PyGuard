{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures and utility functions for handling extraction actions and attributes, primarily for web scraping or automation tasks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: 'value' (iterable of actions), 'input' (dict), 'options' (dict).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data leading to security effects; the functions primarily transform data into hashable forms and back.",
  "flows": "Input data is transformed via 'make_hashable' for storage or comparison, then reconstructed with '_from_hashable'. No network or system command execution is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The functions perform standard data transformation tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions and helper functions for converting data structures into hashable forms and back. These functions are used for deduplication, caching, or comparison of complex nested data. No code execution, external data access, or system modifications are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors. The data transformations are straightforward, with no evident obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for handling data transformations and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. It is likely safe and intended for data processing within a larger scraping or automation framework.",
