{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and utility functions for handling actions, selectors, and input attributes, likely in the context of web scraping or automation workflows.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: 'value' (an iterable of actions), 'input' (a dictionary), and 'options' (an optional dictionary).",
  "sinks": "Functions 'make_hashable' and 'custom_attrs' process data, converting complex objects into hashable types; no direct untrusted data output or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is received by 'actions' (from an iterable of dicts), then transformed into hashable forms by 'make_hashable', and reconstructed by '_from_hashable'. 'custom_attrs' processes input and options, converting them into hashable sets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are observed. The code performs data transformation tasks typical for hashable representations and does not execute any system commands, network operations, or handle sensitive data directly.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures and provides utility functions for making data hashable and converting it back. Functions operate on in-memory data without external data input or output. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions are safe and serve a benign purpose related to data normalization and hashing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for data handling in a web automation context. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The functions are straightforward and do not perform any suspicious operations.",
