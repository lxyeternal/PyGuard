{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures and utility functions for handling actions and extraction sources, likely used within a web scraping or automation framework.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; the functions operate on passed data structures such as dictionaries and iterables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the functions transform input data into hashable forms or convert back, with no network or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data is taken from input structures, converted into hashable formats, or reconstructed, without any external or system side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious logic are present. The code primarily handles data transformation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions for enums and dictionaries representing actions and extraction sources. It includes functions to convert objects into hashable forms (make_hashable) and back (_from_hashable), which are used in the actions() function to process an iterable of actions. The functions 'custom_attrs' generate hashable representations of input dictionaries and options, facilitating deduplication or caching. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, with clear intent for data handling. Overall, this appears to be utility code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for data transformation and handling within a larger system. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The functions perform standard operations with no security concerns.",
