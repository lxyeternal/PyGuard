{
  "purpose": "This code configures version checks and conditional imports for a Scrapy-based project, including user-agent setup and optional dependencies handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from importlib.metadata, scrapy, packaging.version, zyte_api.utils, and internal version files.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious commands; no network, file, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Imports and version comparisons set flags for conditional behavior but do not involve data flows from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The dynamic import fallback for 'build_from_crawler' appears standard for compatibility. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment setup, version checks, and conditional imports primarily for compatibility and feature toggling. It reads version info and imports modules conditionally based on the environment. There are no indications of data injection, network communication, or backdoor logic. The import fallback functions are typical for handling library compatibility. The import of 'scrapy_poet' is optional and only influences feature support flags. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup and compatibility module for a Scrapy project, with no malicious intent or security risks observed. It merely manages dependencies and feature flags based on environment conditions.",
