  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is primarily about dependency management, version checks, conditional imports, and setting configuration flags.\n- No user input, network activity, file system operations, or command execution is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The import fallback functions are standard for compatibility.\n- The optional import of 'scrapy-poet' is benign and controlled via version checks.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code manages dependencies and compatibility, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- securityRisk: 0.1 (very low, perhaps considering minimal risk from import fallback)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- confidence: 0.9 (reasonable)\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Summary:** Also correctly states that the code is about version compatibility and safe imports, with no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- securityRisk: 0 (appropriate)  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Summary:** Similar to above, emphasizing the standard nature of dependency and version management, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Summary:** Highlights dependency management, version checks, and feature flags, with no suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Summary:** Again, notes the setup nature, version checks, and compatibility, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is accurate. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All are very low (0 or 0.1), consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** High, given the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n**Risk:** 0 — minimal security risk, primarily related to dependency management, which is normal.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The code is standard setup/configuration code for a Scrapy project, managing dependencies and compatibility.\n- No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted data, no network operations, no secrets.\n- The fallback functions are typical for compatibility and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
