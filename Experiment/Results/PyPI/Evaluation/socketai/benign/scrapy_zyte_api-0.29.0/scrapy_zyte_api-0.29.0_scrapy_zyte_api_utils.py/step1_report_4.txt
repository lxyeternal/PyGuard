{
  "purpose": "This code configures version dependencies, imports necessary modules, and sets up environment-specific flags for a Scrapy-based web scraping project with Zyte API integration.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as importlib.metadata, scrapy, packaging.version, zyte_api.utils, and local __version__; reads version info for dependencies; reads environment variables like __version__.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling points are evident; no data leakage or external calls are made directly in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Uses version information as flow control logic to set feature support flags; imports modules based on version compatibility; constructs a user agent string with version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures detected. All code appears standard for environment setup and dependency management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages dependencies, versions, and feature flags based on imported module versions. It uses conditional imports and version checks to maintain compatibility across different environments and Scrapy versions. No untrusted data, external network calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Its structure and purpose align with normal project configuration routines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup module for a Scrapy project integrating Zyte API, with dependency management and feature flag settings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
