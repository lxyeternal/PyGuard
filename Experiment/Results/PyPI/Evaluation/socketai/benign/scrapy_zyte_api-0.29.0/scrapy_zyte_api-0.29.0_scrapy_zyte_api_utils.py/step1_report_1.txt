{
  "purpose": "This code initializes version dependencies and conditional imports for a Scrapy-based project, configuring user agents and compatibility flags based on library versions.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from importlib.metadata, imported modules (scrapy, packaging, zyte_api.utils), and package __version__.",
  "sinks": "Uses version comparisons and conditional imports, no untrusted data handling, no network or file system operations, no command execution.",
  "flows": "Importing modules and version checks influence subsequent code behavior, but there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code primarily handles version management and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully manages dependencies and compatibility through version checks and conditional imports, which is standard practice. It imports modules, defines version-related constants, and handles ImportError exceptions gracefully. There is no evidence of obfuscated or malicious code, no dynamic execution of untrusted data, or suspicious network activity.\n\nOverall, this appears to be a typical setup/configuration code for a Scrapy project with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency and version management setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any untrusted data handling or network operations. The overall security risk is minimal.",
