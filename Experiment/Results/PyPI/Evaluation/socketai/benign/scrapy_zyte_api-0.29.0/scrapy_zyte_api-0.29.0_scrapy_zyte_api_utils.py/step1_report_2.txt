{
  "purpose": "This code configures version compatibility, imports modules, and sets up user agent strings for a web scraping project that uses Scrapy and Zyte API.",
  "sources": "Version functions from importlib.metadata, external modules (scrapy, packaging, zyte_api.utils, scrapy_poet), and local __version__.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains sinks that handle untrusted input; it primarily imports modules, defines constants, and checks versions.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves module versions, sets user agent strings, and defines compatibility flags based on these versions, with no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The code structure is straightforward, with version checks and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version constants and feature flags based on package versions, imports modules safely with fallback mechanisms, and constructs user agent strings. There is no handling of user input, network operations, or data processing that could introduce security risks. The only notable activity is version comparison and conditional imports, which are standard practices. No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or malware is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for managing compatibility and configuration in a web scraping environment. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies.",
