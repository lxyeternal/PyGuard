  "purpose": "Manage dependency versions, feature flags, and conditional imports for a Scrapy project, ensuring compatibility and environment setup.",
  "sources": "Version checks, import statements, and string formatting for user agent.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; configuration flags are set internally.",
  "flows": "Version comparisons determine feature flags; optional imports influence support flags.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency management, version compatibility checks, and optional dependency handling. It uses straightforward conditional logic and fallback functions for backward compatibility. No network activity, untrusted data handling, or code execution is present. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for dependency and environment management in a Scrapy project. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, aligning with the analysis.",
