  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic.\n   - No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present.\n   - This is a standard practice in Python packages for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in any report.\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n3. **Score Justification:**\n   - All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0`.\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature, these scores are appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty in the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - The security risk is zero, as there's no security concern in assigning a version string.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No overestimations of risk or malicious activity.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No need for adjustments.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code snippet is a standard version declaration in a Python package, with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
