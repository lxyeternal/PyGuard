  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code snippet is benign and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as a straightforward version string assignment.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - No mention of overlooked potential issues, which seems appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n   - **Suggestion:** No adjustments needed; the scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification for higher scores; the current scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nGiven the minimal and straightforward nature of the code, the scores are appropriate. The code is a standard version string assignment, common in Python packages, with no signs of malicious or insecure behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign and typical for version declaration.  \n- No changes to scores are necessary.  \n- The detailed analysis confirms that the package snippet poses no security threat.",
