  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a package version indicator.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. It contains no input/output operations, external calls, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate given the simplicity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The current scores are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
