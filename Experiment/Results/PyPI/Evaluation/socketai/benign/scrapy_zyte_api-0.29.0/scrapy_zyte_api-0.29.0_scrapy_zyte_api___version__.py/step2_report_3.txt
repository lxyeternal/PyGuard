  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code snippet is: `__version__ = \"0.29.0\"`.\n   - It is a straightforward assignment of a version string to a variable, a common pattern in Python packages.\n   - No input/output operations, no external calls, no complex logic, no obfuscation.\n\n2. **Issue Presence**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or hidden behaviors are present.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence score is 1 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Flaws**:\n   - No flaws or logical errors are evident.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n5. **Justification of Risk Scores**:\n   - Since the code is just a version string assignment, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - No reason exists to assign a higher risk or malware score.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code snippet is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent.\n   - The reports are thorough and correctly conclude that there are no security issues.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Keep all scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- Confirm that the code is benign and does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is harmless, and the scoring reflects that. No changes are necessary.",
