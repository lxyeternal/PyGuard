  "purpose": "Middleware classes for managing Zyte API requests, handling request parameters, conflicts, request limits, and request metadata.",
  "sources": "Request headers, request meta, optional external modules (scrapy_crawlera, scrapy_zyte_smartproxy), request input data.",
  "sinks": "Request meta modifications, logging outputs, spider closure signals, request processing flow.",
  "flows": "Request parsing and validation -> conflict and limit checks -> request meta modifications -> request handling and forwarding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of dynamic imports is standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard middleware functions for request management, conflict detection, and request limits. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The dynamic import pattern for optional modules is typical and not suspicious. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate middleware operations, with low risk and malware scores justified. The slight variation in risk scores (0.1-0.2) reflects normal operational considerations, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate middleware for Zyte API request handling within Scrapy, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
