{
  "purpose": "This code implements a comprehensive Amazon S3 client SDK, providing functionalities for bucket and object management, request signing (v2/v4), retries, MIME detection, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, user parameters, network responses, and files.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to S3 endpoints, response parsing, and configuration updates.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs and environment variables into request creation, signing, and network transmission; responses are parsed and handled accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. MIME detection uses 'magic' with fallbacks, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK for interacting with S3-compatible services, with proper request signing, error handling, retries, and external dependency management. The fallback MIME detection is benign. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The external 'magic' library is used appropriately with fallbacks, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, secure, and aligned with best practices for an open-source S3 client SDK. No malicious intent or sabotage is evident.",
