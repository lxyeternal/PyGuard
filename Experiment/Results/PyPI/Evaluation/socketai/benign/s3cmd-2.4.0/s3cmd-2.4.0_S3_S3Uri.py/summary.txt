  "conclusion": "The code is a typical URI handling utility for AWS and related schemes, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score is 0. The dynamic subclass pattern is a minor concern but not malicious. The code is safe for use in production environments, assuming external configurations are secure."
