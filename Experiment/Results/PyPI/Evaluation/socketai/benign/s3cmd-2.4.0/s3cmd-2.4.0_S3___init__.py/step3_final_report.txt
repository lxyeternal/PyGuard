  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a simple UTF-8 encoding declaration comment in a Python file, indicating the file's character encoding but containing no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code only contains a comment line.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there are no data flows, inputs, or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist, as the code is purely a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard encoding declaration with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python comment specifying UTF-8 encoding. It contains no executable code, data sources, sinks, or flows. The code is standard and benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as harmless, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. Confidence is high (1), as the code's simplicity leaves little room for misinterpretation. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard encoding declaration comment with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The overall security risk is negligible, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
