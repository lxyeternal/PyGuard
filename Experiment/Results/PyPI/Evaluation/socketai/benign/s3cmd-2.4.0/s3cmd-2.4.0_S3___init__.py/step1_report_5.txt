{
  "purpose": "The code only contains a coding declaration indicating UTF-8 encoding; it does not perform any operations or contain executable logic.",
  "sources": "No sources; the code does not read any input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there are no data outputs or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code lacks executable statements or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The file only contains a coding declaration line, which is benign and standard in Python files; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal header specifying the source encoding as UTF-8. It contains no executable code, data handling, or logic. As a result, there are no potential security issues, data flows, or malicious behaviors within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is harmless and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply declares the source file encoding. The absence of any executable code indicates a very low malware and security risk score.",
