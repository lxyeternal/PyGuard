  "purpose": "The code appears to be a placeholder or a minimal file with only a coding declaration and no executable logic.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The file contains only a coding declaration and no functional code, which is unusual for a complete module.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a file encoding declaration ('# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-') with no other code, functions, or logic. This suggests it is either an incomplete file, a template, or a placeholder. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no suspicious or malicious activity can be inferred from this minimal content. No obfuscation, malware, or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal code snippet, there is no malicious behavior or security concern. It appears to be a benign, non-functional placeholder or template file.",
