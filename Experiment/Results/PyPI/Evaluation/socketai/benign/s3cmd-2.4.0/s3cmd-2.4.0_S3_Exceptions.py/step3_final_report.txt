  "purpose": "This code defines exception classes and error handling routines for an Amazon S3 client library, including XML parsing and SSL error management.",
  "sources": "Response data containing XML, SSL error triggers, and exception raising points.",
  "sinks": "Error logging and exception raising; no untrusted data directly processed into critical operations.",
  "flows": "Response data → XML parsing → Exception handling and logging",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns; fallback imports are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward exception and error handling module for S3 operations, with standard practices such as fallback imports for compatibility, error logging, and XML parsing. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The use of exception classes and error parsing aligns with typical error management routines. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign error handling library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified given the code's functionality.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
