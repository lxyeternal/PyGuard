  "purpose": "The code appears to be a unit test for Diffie-Hellman key exchange functions using the pure25519 library.",
  "sources": "os.urandom for generating cryptographic randomness",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks that lead to data leaks or system effects; no external data outputs or network activity",
  "flows": "os.urandom (source) feeds into dh_start, which produces private/public keys, and then dh_finish computes shared secrets",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of cryptographic functions and testing practices",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test utilizing secure random number generation for key exchange testing with the pure25519 library. It performs multiple iterations to verify consistent Diffie-Hellman shared secret computation. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The use of cryptographic libraries and testing framework aligns with normal practices. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign unit test for cryptographic key exchange, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
