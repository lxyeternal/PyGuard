  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated; it appears to perform some form of data processing or network communication, but without clear documentation, the intent is ambiguous.",
  "sources": "Any input functions, environment variable reads, or data fetched from network or files. Specific source points are not evident due to the lack of context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or data exfiltration points. Details are not explicit from the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, or network data) to sinks (network transmission, file writing). Without specific code, exact flow paths cannot be confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution were detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet provided is either missing or too minimal to analyze thoroughly. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are visible. Usage of third-party libraries or network calls cannot be confirmed due to incomplete information. Without further context, the risk remains indeterminate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but due to incomplete details, confidence in this assessment is limited.",
