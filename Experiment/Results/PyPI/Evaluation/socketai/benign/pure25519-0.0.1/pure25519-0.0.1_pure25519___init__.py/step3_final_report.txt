  "purpose": "Analysis of potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks in the provided Python code.",
  "sources": "Untrusted input sources such as environment variables, network data, hardcoded URLs, and dynamic code execution points like 'exec' and 'eval'.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file operations, logs, or data exfiltration points, especially when combined with dynamic code execution or obfuscated strings.",
  "flows": "From sources like untrusted data or obfuscated strings to sinks such as network transmission or file writes, often mediated by dynamic execution functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated strings, use of 'exec'/'eval' on untrusted data, hardcoded suspicious URLs, and dynamic code generation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation (e.g., encoded strings, dynamic execution), uses 'exec'/'eval' with untrusted data, and contains suspicious URLs indicating malicious intent. These are strong red flags for malicious activity. Other reports correctly identify benign or insufficient code, assigning low or zero scores. The high suspicion in Report 2 is justified by the indicators. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior is found in the benign reports. The overall assessment aligns with the described behaviors, with the malicious code warranting high malware and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code described in Report 2 strongly suggests malicious intent, justified by obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious URLs, leading to high malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.9), and risk (0.85) scores. The other reports are consistent with benign or insufficient code. Overall, the assessment is appropriate and the scores are justified.",
