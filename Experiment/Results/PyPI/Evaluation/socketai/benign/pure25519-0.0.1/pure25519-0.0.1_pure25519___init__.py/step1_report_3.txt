{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to be a Python module possibly intended for data processing or utility functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from variables, possibly from environment variables or function inputs, but no external data sources such as files, network, or user input are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks like network connections, file writes, or system commands are present. No use of eval, exec, or subprocess with untrusted input is observed.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows; the code mainly processes internal variables without external data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are detected. The code is straightforward without obfuscation or unnecessary dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Python operations, including variable assignments and possibly some function calls. It does not include network operations, file manipulations, or security-sensitive functions. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed. The absence of external data handling or dangerous functions suggests a benign intent, although the code fragment is minimal and lacks context for a definitive conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no anomalies or suspicious activities detected.",
