  "purpose": "Implement a simple Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve25519 for key generation and shared secret computation.",
  "sources": "random_scalar(entropy_f), bytes_to_element(Y_s)",
  "sinks": "sha256(XY.to_bytes()).digest()",
  "flows": "random_scalar -> Base.scalarmult -> bytes_to_element -> scalarmult -> sha256 digest",
  "anomalies": "Use of basic Diffie-Hellman without additional validation; no obvious anomalies, but the code comments suggest it is an example, not production-ready.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: dh_start generates a private scalar and corresponding public key; dh_finish computes a shared secret using the other party's public key and hashes it with sha256. The implementation is straightforward, utilizing the 'pure25519' library for elliptic curve operations. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, suspicious data leaks, or malicious behavior. The use of sha256 for hashing the shared secret is standard. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident. The code is minimal and aligns with standard Diffie-Hellman key exchange procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve25519 with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a basic, example implementation suitable for cryptographic purposes but lacks additional security features for production use.",
