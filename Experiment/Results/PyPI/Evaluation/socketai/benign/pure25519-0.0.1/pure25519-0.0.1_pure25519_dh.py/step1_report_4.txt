  "sinks": "sha256(XY.to_bytes()).digest()",
  "flows": "random_scalar -> Base.scalarmult -> bytes_to_element -> scalar multiplication -> sha256 digest",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; straightforward cryptographic operations; no suspicious network activity or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic functions for Diffie-Hellman key exchange on Curve25519. It uses standard cryptographic primitives from the 'pure25519' library, including random scalar generation and point scalar multiplication. The 'dh_start' function generates a private scalar and public key, while 'dh_finish' computes the shared secret by scalar multiplying the received public key with the private scalar, then hashing the result. The operations appear standard and consistent with cryptographic best practices. No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. Overall, the implementation is a typical example of elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, implementing a standard cryptographic protocol without malicious intent. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks beyond typical cryptographic operations. It is a safe and straightforward implementation.",
