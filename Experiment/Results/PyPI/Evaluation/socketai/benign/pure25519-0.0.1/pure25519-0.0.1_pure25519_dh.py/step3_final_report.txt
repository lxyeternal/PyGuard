  "purpose": "Implement a Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve25519, generating a private scalar and public key, then computing a shared secret hashed with sha256.",
  "sources": "random_scalar() for private key; bytes_to_element() for peer's public key input",
  "sinks": "sha256() digest of the shared secret (XY.to_bytes())",
  "flows": "x (private scalar) and Y_s (peer's public key bytes) flow into scalar multiplication, resulting in XY, which flows into sha256 hash",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard cryptographic operations; no network activity or data leaks",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Curve25519 Diffie-Hellman key exchange: generating a random scalar, computing a public key, and deriving a shared secret hashed with sha256. It uses well-established cryptographic primitives with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The absence of public key validation is a minor security consideration but typical for example code. The code is clear, straightforward, and aligns with best practices for minimal cryptographic implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure-looking implementation of Curve25519 Diffie-Hellman, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given its minimal validation and production readiness. No malicious intent detected; the code is safe for use in controlled contexts.",
