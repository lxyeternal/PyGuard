  "sinks": "sha256(XY.to_bytes()).digest()",
  "flows": "random_scalar -> Base.scalarmult -> bytes_to_element -> XY.scalarmult -> sha256 digest",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a random scalar 'x' using the provided entropy function and computes a public key 'X'. It then takes a peer's public key 'Y_s', converts it to an elliptic curve point, and performs scalar multiplication to derive a shared secret 'XY'. This secret is hashed with sha256 for further use. All operations utilize standard cryptographic primitives without apparent obfuscation or malicious patterns. There are no data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a straightforward Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve25519 with standard functions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
