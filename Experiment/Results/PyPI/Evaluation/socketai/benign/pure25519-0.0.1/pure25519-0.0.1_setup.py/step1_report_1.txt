  "purpose": "Setup script for the pure25519 Python package, enabling testing and benchmarking of cryptographic routines.",
  "sources": "User inputs: command-line arguments, package metadata, module imports, test discovery functions, and module-specific functions during runtime.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() calls based on test results; potential to terminate process based on test outcomes.",
  "flows": "Input (command-line arguments) to test execution; module imports to execution of test and speed functions; test results to sys.exit() which terminates the script.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. No network activity, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration observed. Use of unittest framework and package setup functions appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It defines custom commands for testing and benchmarking the cryptographic library 'pure25519'. The code imports modules, defines test classes, and configures package metadata, all in a conventional manner. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The only potentially sensitive activity is the sys.exit() based on test results, which is typical in test scripts. No external network activity or hidden code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with testing and benchmarking commands. It contains no malicious or suspicious activity, no obfuscated code, and no security risks beyond standard package setup. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
