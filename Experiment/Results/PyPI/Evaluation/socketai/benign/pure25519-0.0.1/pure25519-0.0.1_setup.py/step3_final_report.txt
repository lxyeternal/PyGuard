{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script with custom commands for testing and benchmarking the 'pure25519' cryptographic library.",
  "sources": "The script reads input from command-line invocation and imports modules such as sys, unittest, and package-specific modules.",
  "sinks": "The script executes test suites and calls sys.exit() based on test results, influencing process termination but not involving untrusted data flows or external network activity.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments trigger test or benchmark runs; test results determine sys.exit() status; no external data flows or untrusted input handling are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py for a Python package, defining custom test and benchmark commands. It imports standard modules, discovers and runs tests, and exits based on success. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The structure and content follow common practices, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correctly set to 0, reflecting its safe and legitimate nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
