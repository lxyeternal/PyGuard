{
  "purpose": "Provides cryptographic functions for Ed25519 key generation, signing, and verification by wrapping an external 'eddsa' module.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (seed32, msg, skvk, sigmsg, vk).",
  "sinks": "Concatenated key data (seed+vk), signatures (sig+msg), and verification results; no external sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input seed32 used to generate public key; sign() uses secret key to produce signature + message; open() verifies signature and outputs message if valid.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; straightforward cryptographic wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code relies on an external 'eddsa' module for core cryptographic primitives, performing standard input validation and exception handling. It constructs keys and signatures following common practices, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The data flow is simple and secure, assuming the external module is trustworthy. No network activity or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper around cryptographic primitives for Ed25519 signatures. It does not contain malware or malicious intent, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given its functionality.",
