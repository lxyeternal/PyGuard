  "purpose": "Implementation of Ed25519-like digital signature scheme for signing and verifying messages.",
  "sources": "Input data includes seed in create_signing_key(), message in sign() and verify(), and public key in verify().",
  "sinks": "Hashing functions, scalar and point computations, and signature verification logic. No external data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Seed from create_signing_key() -> publickey() -> signature() -> checkvalid() -> verify(). Message data flows through hashing, signing, and verification steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs observed. The code implements standard cryptographic operations without unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of a digital signature scheme using elliptic curve operations with hashlib for hashing. The functions for key creation, signing, and verification follow expected cryptographic procedures. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. All cryptographic operations appear standard and correctly implemented. No external network communication or data leaks are present. The use of os.urandom for key generation is appropriate and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a cryptographic signing scheme with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed solely for signing and verifying messages with no hidden functionalities.",
