  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, correctly implemented elliptic curve signature scheme with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the cryptographic context. Overall, the code is secure and trustworthy based on the analysis."
