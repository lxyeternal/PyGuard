{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define data structures and classes for parsing, managing, and validating SQL statements and related metadata in a larger database interaction context.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as .sql.dml_sql, .sql.base, .sql.common, .sql.parser, and .error, which may handle SQL parsing and error handling. The code also reads class attributes and method parameters related to SQL operations.",
  "sinks": "The main data flows are within class methods handling SQL parsing and validation. There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is directly executed or transmitted. The only potential concern is the 'api_request' attribute in the Statement class, which could be a dictionary derived from SQL parsing.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves parsing SQL statements into internal representations, validating statement types, and managing collections of statements. It does not include direct execution or network transmission of data, but the 'api_request' could be used downstream for such purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code relies on imported modules for SQL parsing; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is evident. The code is straightforward and typical for SQL statement handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for column metadata, SQL statement parsing, validation, and collection management. The SQLParser and related modules are imported but not shown; assuming they handle SQL security properly. The logic enforces restrictions on batch DDL/Utility statements and supports only certain query types. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, system command execution, or network communication, are present. The code is structured cleanly, with no unusual or suspicious patterns. Given the lack of any active code execution, network activity, or data leakage, the risk of malware is very low.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a data management layer for SQL statements, with validation to restrict certain operations. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities within this module. It relies on external parsing modules for SQL processing, which are assumed to be secure. Overall, the code appears benign and focused on internal data handling.",
