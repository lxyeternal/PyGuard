  "purpose": "Provides classes and methods for managing SQL statement metadata, parsing, and validation within a database interface, relying on external SQL parsing modules.",
  "sources": "SQLParser.transform() method processing SQL strings; class constructors and property setters reading internal attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the output of SQLParser.transform() which processes SQL input; internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Input SQL strings -> SQLParser.transform() -> internal statement and metadata objects -> validation and management methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages data structures for SQL metadata and validation, relying on external modules for parsing. No active network, file, or system modification operations are present. The reliance on external modules like SQLParser.transform() could be a concern if those modules are malicious, but within this code, no malicious activity is evident. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The primary concern lies in the security of external dependencies, which are outside the scope of this review. Overall, it appears safe for use.",
