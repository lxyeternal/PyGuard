{
  "purpose": "The code implements various executor classes for executing database statements via API calls, handling response dispatch, processing response data, and managing internal metadata and state.",
  "sources": "API responses from execute_statement, batch_execute_statement, execute_transaction, create_table, update_table, delete_table, create_global_table, update_global_table, list_tables, describe_table, list_global_tables, describe_global_table; input statements providing api_request data.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures (_rows, _metadata, _errors), JSON serialization of responses, internal state updates, and data deserialization.",
  "flows": "API responses flow into response processing methods, where data is deserialized and stored into internal structures; no untrusted external inputs influence critical data flows; response data is processed into internal metadata and row collections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. The code is modular, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of executor classes that handle API dispatching, response processing, and metadata management for database operations. Response data is safely deserialized and stored internally. Exception handling and retries are implemented appropriately. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The code operates as a typical SDK component, with data flows confined to internal structures and API responses. No external untrusted inputs influence security-sensitive operations. The overall structure and logic are clear and standard for such SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured database executor framework with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The response handling and data management are standard and secure. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2).",
