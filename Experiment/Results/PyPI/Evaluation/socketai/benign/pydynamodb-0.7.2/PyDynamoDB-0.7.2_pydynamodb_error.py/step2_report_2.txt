  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for database errors, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class.\n- The classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code, no input/output, no external dependencies, and no obfuscation.\n- The purpose appears to be to facilitate structured error handling in a database-related application.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. All reports uniformly describe the code as benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code.\n  - **Security Risk / Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is a typical exception hierarchy for database error handling.\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The purpose is purely structural, intended for use elsewhere.\n\n### Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is justified. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is justified. The code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified. The code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The code is a standard, safe component with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the provided reports and the actual code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for database error handling. All reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
