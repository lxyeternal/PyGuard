  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for database error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only class definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard exception class hierarchy.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes for database error handling, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no input/output operations, no use of environment variables, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The structure appears to follow standard patterns for exception class hierarchy, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a typical exception hierarchy setup for database-related errors. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, and no security risks are present.",
