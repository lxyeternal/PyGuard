{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for database error handling, facilitating structured error management in database-related Python applications.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for error types; no external data sources, input/output, or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; purely class hierarchy setup.",
  "flows": "N/A — static class definitions without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static set of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception, with no external dependencies, dynamic code, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured exception hierarchy for database errors, with no security risks or malicious intent. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and consistent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
