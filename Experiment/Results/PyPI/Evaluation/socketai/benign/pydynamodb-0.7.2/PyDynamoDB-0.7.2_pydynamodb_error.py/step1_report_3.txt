  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for database error handling",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read by the code",
  "sinks": "No data is written or sent to external systems",
  "flows": "None, as the code only defines classes without any data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of class definitions and an __all__ list",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes related to database errors, inheriting from built-in Exception classes. There are no external data inputs, no execution of dynamic code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The structure is straightforward, with clear class hierarchies. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining custom exception classes for database error handling with no malicious intent or security issues.",
