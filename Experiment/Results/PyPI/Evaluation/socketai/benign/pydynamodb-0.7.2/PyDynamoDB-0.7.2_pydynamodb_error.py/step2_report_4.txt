  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines a set of custom exception classes for database error handling, inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - The classes follow a typical hierarchy, with no dynamic code, external data sources, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The `__all__` list explicitly exports these classes, which is standard practice.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Issue Confirmation:**\n   - The reports assert that the code contains only class definitions with no external data handling, no dynamic code, and no malicious behavior.\n   - Based on the code, these claims are accurate; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a standard exception hierarchy with no security risks.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n4. **Scores Review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high, justified)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct)\n     - `malware`: 0 (correct)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (correct)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions for error handling, the risk is minimal.\n   - The malware score is correctly 0; no malicious activity is present.\n   - The security risk score is also correctly 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's static nature.\n   - No suspicious patterns or external interactions are claimed or implied.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence should stay at 1, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's security posture.",
