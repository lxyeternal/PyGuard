  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to database errors and warnings for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; the code solely defines classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward class definitions with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical set of custom exception class definitions for database error handling, following inheritance from built-in Exception classes. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. No external data sources, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The structure and content are standard for a Python error module, with no obfuscation or hidden intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of class definitions for database-related exceptions with no malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate, standard component of a larger application.",
