  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\n- The code defines a set of custom exception classes for database error handling, inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception` class.\n- The class hierarchy appears standard, with specific error types such as `OperationalError`, `DataError`, etc.\n- The `__all__` list explicitly exports these classes.\n- There are no external data sources, no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Evaluation of the Reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently state that the code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy.\n- They correctly identify that the code involves only class definitions, with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n- Their conclusions that there are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation are accurate based on the code provided.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. There is no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5. Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Issues:**\n\n- No issues detected in the logic, reasoning, or scoring.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard exception class hierarchy for database error handling.\n- There are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.",
