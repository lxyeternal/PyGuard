  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a set of custom exception classes for database error handling, inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception` class.\n   - The classes follow a standard hierarchy, e.g., `InterfaceError`, `DatabaseError`, `OperationalError`, etc.\n   - The `__all__` list explicitly exports these class names.\n   - There are no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, environment variable usage, or external data sources involved.\n   - The code appears clean, straightforward, and adheres to common Python practices for exception hierarchy setup.\n\n2. **Evaluation of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly state that the code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code serves as a standard exception hierarchy for database error handling.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or potential vulnerabilities are detected.\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Assessment of Scores and Logic:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable given the analysis.\n   - Since the code is straightforward class definitions with no external interactions or obfuscation, these scores are appropriate.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Concerns:**\n   - Given the simplicity and standard nature of the code, there are no underlying security issues.\n   - The code does not introduce supply chain risks or malicious payloads.\n   - The reports' conclusions are consistent with the code content.\n\n5. **Final Justification:**\n   - The code is a typical, well-structured set of custom exception classes.\n   - No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n   - The risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n   - The overall security posture of this code is benign.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, secure, and non-malicious component of a larger application, with no security concerns.",
