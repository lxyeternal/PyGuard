  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for database-related errors",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; all classes are defined statically",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flows present, as this is solely class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various error types, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception classes. It serves as a structured way to handle database errors. No data input/output, no code injection, no environment variables, and no dynamic code execution are present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious logic are detected. The code appears to be a typical error class module for database error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign set of custom exception class definitions for database errors. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues are present.",
