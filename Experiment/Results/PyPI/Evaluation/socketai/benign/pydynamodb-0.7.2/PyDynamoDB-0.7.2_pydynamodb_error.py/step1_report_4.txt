  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for database-related errors following a hierarchy.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "None, as there are no data flows involving external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only class definitions for exceptions with no unusual or suspicious code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for database error handling, following an inheritance hierarchy. It uses standard Python syntax with no dynamic code execution, no external data reading, and no security-sensitive operations. No anomalies or signs of malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions for database error handling. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
