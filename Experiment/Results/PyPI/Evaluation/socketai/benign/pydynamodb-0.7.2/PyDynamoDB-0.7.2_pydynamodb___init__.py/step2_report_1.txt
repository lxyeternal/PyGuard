  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code and potential security concerns.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines versioning, type objects, and a connect() function that conditionally sets a cursor class based on a 'connector' parameter.\n- Uses wildcard import from `.error`.\n- No network activity, data processing, or external data handling is visible.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward database API setup.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Benign, defines constants and a connection function.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** No dangerous sinks; potential concern with the wildcard import.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code; wildcard import could conceal malicious code, but not evident here.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (reasonable, minor concern about wildcard import)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. No issues with the logic or scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, standard database interface.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** No direct data exfiltration or network activity.\n- **Analysis:** Wildcard import is noted but typical; no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (minor concern)\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code; scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, database interface.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** No suspicious data flow.\n- **Analysis:** Wildcard import could hide malicious code, but no evidence here.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, database connection setup.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** No malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Wildcard import is noted but standard; no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as others, defining database API.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; import patterns are typical.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** No. The code is primarily configuration and connection setup.\n- **Wildcard import concern:** Valid but common; no evidence of malicious code within this snippet.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only minor concern is the wildcard import which could conceal malicious code if the imported module is compromised, but there's no indication here.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risks are low, reflecting minor concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The malware scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n- The obfuscated score remains 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk scores are reasonable, given the wildcard import and dynamic behavior, but overall low.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, mainly due to wildcard import concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are thorough and accurate. The code appears benign with minimal security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No evidence of supply chain attack or malicious code is present in this snippet. The main point of vigilance is the wildcard import, which should be reviewed in the context of the entire module.",
