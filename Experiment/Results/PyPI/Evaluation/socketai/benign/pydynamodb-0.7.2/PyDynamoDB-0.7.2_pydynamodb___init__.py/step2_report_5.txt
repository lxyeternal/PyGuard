  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines constants, a type object class, and a connect() function. No direct data processing or external network activity. The wildcard import from `.error` is noted but common.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the benign analysis. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — justified given the wildcard import, which could hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised, but there's no evidence here.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning and scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dynamic configuration via `connect()`. No suspicious code or network activity.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with benign assessment.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — justified for the broad import, which could conceal malicious code if the module is compromised, but no evidence here.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores and reasoning are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general structure; no malicious actions, just dynamic connection setup.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the broad import, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar benign overview; no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — justified for broad import, but no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical database connection setup with no suspicious code or network activity.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with benign nature.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no suspicious patterns or risky behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, correctly indicating no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, justified by the broad import statement which could potentially hide malicious code if the imported module were compromised, but there's no evidence of such here.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the provided analyses.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk is present in this code snippet.\n- The only minor concern is the wildcard import, which is a common pattern but could be exploited if the imported module is malicious. However, in this context, it does not seem to be.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, primarily due to wildcard import, but no active threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign with no immediate security risks. The current scores are appropriate; I would maintain them as-is.",
