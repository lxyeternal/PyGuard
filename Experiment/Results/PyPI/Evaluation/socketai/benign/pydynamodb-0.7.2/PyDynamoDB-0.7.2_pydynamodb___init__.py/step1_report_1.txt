{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a database API module with type definitions, versioning, and a connection function.",
  "sources": "Reading of the 'connector' parameter from kwargs in the connect() function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the Connection class and SupersetCursor if they process untrusted input, but no direct dangerous sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The connect() function retrieves the 'connector' parameter, potentially modifies kwargs, and passes them to the Connection constructor, which is outside this code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from '.error' which may import unspecified code; no explicit handling of untrusted input beyond 'connector' parameter. The code is mostly configuration and class definitions without dangerous operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines some constants and a class for type objects, with no apparent user input handling or external data processing. The connect() function conditionally updates parameters based on a 'connector' value and creates a Connection object, which is imported from another module. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The wildcard import from '.error' could potentially import malicious code if the module is compromised, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. Overall, the code appears benign, primarily focused on defining constants and a factory function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign database API module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The only slight concern is the wildcard import, which depends on the contents of the imported module. No malicious intent or dangerous operations are present.",
