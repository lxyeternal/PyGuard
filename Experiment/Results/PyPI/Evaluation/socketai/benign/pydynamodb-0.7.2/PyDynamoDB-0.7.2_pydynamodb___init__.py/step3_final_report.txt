{
  "purpose": "Defines database version info, type objects, and a connection factory function with dynamic cursor class assignment based on parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to connect(), particularly 'connector' in kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The connect() function creates and returns a Connection object; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "connect() reads 'connector' from kwargs, updates kwargs with cursor_class if needed, then passes args to Connection.",
  "anomalies": "Wildcard import from .error; no malicious code detected but could conceal malicious code if the imported module is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward database API setup with versioning, type objects, and a connect() function that conditionally sets a cursor class. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The wildcard import is a minor concern but common in Python modules; no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. The wildcard import is a minor concern but not malicious. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
