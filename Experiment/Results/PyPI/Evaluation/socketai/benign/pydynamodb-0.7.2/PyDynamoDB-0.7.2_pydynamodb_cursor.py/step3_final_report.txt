  "purpose": "Implementation of a DynamoDB cursor supporting execution, batching, transactions, and result fetching, with parameter serialization and resource management.",
  "sources": "User inputs, method parameters, internal statement queues, connection object states.",
  "sinks": "API request parameters, result set outputs, exception handling flows.",
  "flows": "Serialize input parameters into API requests; append statements; execute or store; fetch results via fetch methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured DynamoDB cursor implementation. It serializes parameters before API requests, manages transaction and batch operations, and handles result fetching with proper resource cleanup. No dynamic code execution, network anomalies, or covert channels are present. The serialization depends on an external converter, which is assumed to be secure. Exception handling and resource management follow best practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard DynamoDB cursor implementation with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The overall security assessment is very low risk (~0.1), consistent with typical database access layers.",
