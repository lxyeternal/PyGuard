{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract base classes for database cursor operations, including table listing, metadata retrieval, and iteration over query results.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include connection parameters, method arguments (such as table names), and external API responses from self.connection._client methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the use of retry_api_call with external API functions and the handling of responses which could potentially process untrusted data, though in this context, they are internal API calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses (list_tables and describe_table calls) into response processing and return values; no untrusted external data is directly incorporated into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. Use of exception handling is standard. No dynamic code execution or unsafe data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract classes with methods for listing tables and retrieving table metadata, utilizing external API calls wrapped in retry logic. No user input is processed directly, and no external data is handled insecurely. The retry_api_call function is external but presumably safe if implemented correctly. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The code structure is standard for database API wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured database cursor base class implementation with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It relies on external API functions and internal handling without evident security risks.",
