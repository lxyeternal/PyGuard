{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes for database cursor operations, including listing tables, retrieving metadata, and iteration, relying on external API calls wrapped with retry logic.",
  "sources": "External API responses from methods like list_tables and describe_table via retry_api_call.",
  "sinks": "Responses used internally; no untrusted data exposed externally.",
  "flows": "API responses flow from external client calls into internal methods, with exception handling and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK component for database interaction, with proper exception handling and no signs of malicious activity. External API calls are wrapped with retry logic, responses are used internally, and no user input or system commands are involved. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk between 0.1 and 0.2) are consistent with the code's structure and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free from malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0, and the low risk scores reflect the minimal security concern. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
