{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and utility methods for database cursor operations, including listing tables and retrieving table metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports modules; methods accessing 'self.connection._client'; methods calling 'retry_api_call' with parameters for listing tables and describing tables.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'retry_api_call' passing 'list_tables' and 'describe_table' functions; potential propagation of exceptions; no untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "Initialization of classes -> method calls to 'retry_api_call' with client methods -> potential exception handling or return data from API responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code relies on external API calls with no evident malicious payload; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly defining abstract classes and helper methods for database interaction, such as listing tables and retrieving table metadata. It uses 'retry_api_call' to invoke external client methods, with exception handling that logs and raises 'OperationalError'. The classes are designed for extension, with no direct data manipulation, user input handling, or sensitive data processing within the provided code. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious side-effects. The code is well-structured, standard, and leverages external APIs for operations, with no embedded or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical abstraction layer for database cursors with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It securely handles exceptions and does not contain any signs of malware or malicious payloads. Overall, it appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
