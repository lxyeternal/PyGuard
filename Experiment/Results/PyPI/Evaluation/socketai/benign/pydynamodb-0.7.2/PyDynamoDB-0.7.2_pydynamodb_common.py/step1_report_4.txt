{
  "purpose": "This code defines abstract base classes for a database cursor and its iterator, providing methods for listing tables, retrieving table metadata, and managing data fetching operations.",
  "sources": "Code reads configuration data (connection, converter, retry config), external API responses via retry_api_call, and class properties. It does not directly read user input or external data streams.",
  "sinks": "The code calls external database client methods (list_tables, describe_table) which are sinks for external API responses. No direct sink of untrusted data into system-critical functions is evident.",
  "flows": "Source: Configuration data and external API responses flow through retry_api_call and response.get(). These data are used internally to list tables and get metadata without directly executing untrusted code or writing to system resources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity. The code is straightforward, with exception handling and standard class structure. No obfuscation or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an abstract database cursor, with methods to list tables and retrieve metadata, using retry logic for external API calls. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or sabotage. The use of external API calls is contained and secured by retry logic and exception handling. No user input handling or code injection vectors are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured, standard database cursor implementation for interacting with an external database API. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this module. It functions as a utility component with proper exception handling and clear design.",
