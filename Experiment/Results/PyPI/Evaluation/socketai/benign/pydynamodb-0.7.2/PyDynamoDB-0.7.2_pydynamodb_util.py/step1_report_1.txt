{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions and retry logic for robust API interactions, including synchronization, string conversion, dictionary flattening, and retry configurations.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, environment variables (indirectly via logger levels), and potentially external API responses.",
  "sinks": "Logging output, exceptions raised during retry attempts, and function outputs; no direct data leaks or unsafe data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through functions like strtobool, flatten_dict, and retry_api_call; retry logic handles exceptions based on API responses; logs are generated after retries.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains standard utility functions, retry configuration with exception filtering, and thread-safe decorators. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code are present. No backdoors or malicious code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for string-to-bool conversion, dictionary flattening, and thread-safe execution. The RetryConfig class allows configuring retry behavior for API calls. The retry_api_call function wraps a provided function with retry logic based on exception types, logging, and exponential backoff. No evidence of malicious intent such as code injection, data theft, or covert communication is found. All components serve legitimate, non-malicious purposes aligned with typical application resilience patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility and retry logic for API robustness. No malicious behavior or supply chain security risks are detected. It functions as intended for application stability without suspicious or malicious actions.",
