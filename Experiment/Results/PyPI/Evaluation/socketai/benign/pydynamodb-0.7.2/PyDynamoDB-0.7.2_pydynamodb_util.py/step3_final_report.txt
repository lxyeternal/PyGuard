  "purpose": "Utility functions for synchronization, string conversion, dictionary flattening, and API call retries with exception filtering.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, exception objects in retry logic.",
  "sinks": "Potential exception handling paths, but no data leaks or insecure actions identified.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions; exceptions are caught and inspected in retry logic; no external or untrusted data flows to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions: a thread-safe decorator, string-to-bool conversion, nested dictionary flattening, and a retry mechanism using 'tenacity' with exception filtering based on error codes. All functions are straightforward, well-structured, and rely on common libraries. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The exception handling in 'retry_api_call' is safe due to default attribute access. The code's purpose is to enhance robustness and thread safety in API interactions. Given the benign nature and clarity, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.2). The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility code with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
