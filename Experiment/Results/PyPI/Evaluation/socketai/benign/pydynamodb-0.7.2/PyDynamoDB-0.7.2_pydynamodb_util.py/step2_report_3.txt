  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency, correctness, and appropriate risk assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code comprises utility functions: synchronization decorator, string-to-bool conversion, dictionary flattening, and a retry mechanism for API calls.\n- The retry logic uses the 'tenacity' library, with exception filtering based on error codes.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are reported.\n- The code appears standard, benign, and intended for robustness and thread safety.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions + retry logic; no malicious activity; high confidence (0.9).\n- **Malware score:** 0, aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1, very low.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign and utility-focused. The reasoning is sound.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions; no suspicious activity; high confidence (0.9).\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, still low.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly dismisses malicious intent, focusing on robustness.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no malicious behavior; high confidence (0.9).\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; the reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no suspicious activity; very high confidence (0.95).\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and accurate.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, benign purpose; high confidence (0.9).\n- **Malware score:** 0, fitting.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; the report correctly assesses the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected. The code is a set of utility functions and retry logic, typical in many applications.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, justified.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low, consistent with benign utility code.\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected or implied).\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present).\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (very low, standard utility code).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately cautious. The code is standard utility and retry logic, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores reflect this understanding correctly.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to 0.2), as the code is benign but still part of a supply chain component.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are no security concerns or malicious indicators in this code. The provided scores are reasonable and justified.",
