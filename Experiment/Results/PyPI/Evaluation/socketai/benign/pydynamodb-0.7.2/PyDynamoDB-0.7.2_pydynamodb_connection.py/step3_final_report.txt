  "purpose": "Manage AWS DynamoDB connections, including role assumption, MFA, and credential handling.",
  "sources": "User input() for MFA codes, AWS SDK responses, environment variables for credentials.",
  "sinks": "AWS SDK API calls (assume_role, assume_role_with_saml, assume_role_with_web_identity, get_session_token), credential assignment.",
  "flows": "User inputs MFA code -> MFA code used in credential request -> AWS SDK call returns credentials -> Credentials stored and used for DynamoDB client.",
  "anomalies": "Use of input() for MFA prompt; replacement of spaces with '+' in saml_assertion; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AWS credential management with role assumption, MFA, and retries. The MFA prompt via input() is typical but could be a minor security surface if environment is compromised. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The credential handling aligns with AWS SDK best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of AWS credential and session management. No malicious intent or supply chain sabotage detected. The use of input() for MFA is common in CLI tools and does not constitute malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low.",
