  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data transformation utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of ast.literal_eval, which is safe in controlled environments but warrants caution if input validation is lacking. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code is suitable for supply chain deployment."
