{
  "purpose": "Provides serialization and deserialization of various data types for data processing and storage, facilitating conversion between Python objects and DynamoDB-like formats.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, including string values, type indicators, and optional function parameters for transformations.",
  "sinks": "Returns converted data structures, potentially used downstream for database operations or data transmission; no external sinks like network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through type-specific conversion functions (_to_string, _to_number, etc.), with potential flow paths involving _to_map, _to_list, and evaluation functions like ast.literal_eval.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ast.literal_eval for number conversion could be risky if input is untrusted; no other anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard serialization/deserialization logic with clear structure and safe practices. The use of ast.literal_eval is generally safe but should be used with validated input. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external malicious activity are present. The code is readable, well-structured, and aligns with typical data handling utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data transformation utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of ast.literal_eval, which is safe in controlled environments but warrants caution if input validation is lacking. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code is suitable for supply chain deployment.",
