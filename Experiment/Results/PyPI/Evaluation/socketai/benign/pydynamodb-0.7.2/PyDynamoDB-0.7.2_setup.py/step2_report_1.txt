  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Standard setup script for packaging a Python library.  \n- Findings: Reads version from `__init__.py` via regex, reads README, no untrusted data or external commands, no obfuscation or malware.  \n- Malware score: 0 (correct).  \n- Risk score: 0 (appropriate).  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, standard package setup.  \n- Findings: Static configuration, no suspicious patterns, no external code execution, no obfuscation.  \n- Malware score: 0 (correct).  \n- Risk score: 0.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Standard setup configuration, reads version info, dependencies, no dynamic execution.  \n- Findings: No untrusted data, no secrets, no obfuscation, standard regex for version extraction.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Risk score: 0.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above, standard package setup.  \n- Findings: Reads version, dependencies, no malicious patterns, no external code execution.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Risk score: 0.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Standard setup script.  \n- Findings: Reads version info, dependencies, no suspicious activity, no obfuscation or malicious code.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Risk score: 0.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external untrusted data handling is present.\n- The code relies on reading local files and static configuration, which is standard practice.\n- The regex used to extract version info is common and not suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or external commands are detected.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the script performs only standard packaging tasks with no security implications.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- All reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security risks.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis: the code is a straightforward, benign setup script with no security concerns.",
