  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Code Behavior & Logic**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python library.\n   - The code reads version info from a local file (__init__.py) using regex, loads README content, and specifies dependencies.\n   - No dynamic code execution, user input, or network activity is present.\n   - No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or unusual constructs are detected.\n\n2. **Potential Security Risks**:\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive information.\n   - No external untrusted data sources are processed at runtime.\n   - The code performs static configuration tasks only.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation**:\n   - No signs of malware, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n   - The regex for version extraction is standard and safe.\n   - All operations are typical for a setup script.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py script.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.\n- The reported issues are accurate; no modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final notes**:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is safe, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe setup.py is a standard, benign packaging script with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.",
