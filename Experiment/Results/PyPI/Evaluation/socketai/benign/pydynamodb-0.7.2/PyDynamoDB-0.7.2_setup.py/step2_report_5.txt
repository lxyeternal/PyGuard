  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, reads version from `__init__.py`, no external inputs or network activity, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected. The logic is straightforward, and no malicious behavior is present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard packaging script, no external inputs, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No anomalies or malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Also a typical setup script, reading version info via regex, no dynamic code execution, no external data processing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup configuration, no suspicious code, dependencies are static, no external execution.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—local file reads, static configuration, no external or untrusted data processing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, and the code is purely for packaging. The code does not perform any network activity, code obfuscation, or suspicious operations. **Malware score should remain 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. **Obfuscated score should stay 0.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious activity, the overall security risk remains negligible. **Risk score should be 0.**\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a typical `setup.py` script used for packaging Python modules. It reads version info from a local file, loads dependencies, and calls `setup()` with static data. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Therefore, my estimated scores are:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all the reports' findings and the code's actual behavior.",
