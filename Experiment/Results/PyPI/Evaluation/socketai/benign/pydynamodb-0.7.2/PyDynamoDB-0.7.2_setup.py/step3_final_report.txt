  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library, defining dependencies, metadata, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from local __init__.py file using regex, reads README file for long description, static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external commands, or network activity; static data used throughout.",
  "flows": "Reads version from local file -> passes static configuration to setup() -> no external or dynamic data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Regex usage is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script performing static configuration tasks for packaging. It reads version info from a local file, loads dependencies, and calls setup() with static data. No external inputs, code execution, or network activity are present. The regex used for version extraction is standard and safe. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. All dependencies are from public repositories. The code structure and content are consistent with benign, standard packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as a typical setup.py file, and the scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.",
