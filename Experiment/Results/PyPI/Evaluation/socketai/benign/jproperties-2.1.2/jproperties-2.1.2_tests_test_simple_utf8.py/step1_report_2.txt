  "purpose": "Load and save properties files with UTF-8 encoding.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'simple.utf8.prop' file from datadir.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'dump.prop' in tmpdir.",
  "flows": "Data read from 'simple.utf8.prop' → loaded into Properties object → stored into 'dump.prop'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code performs standard file I/O and property handling with UTF-8 encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code loads properties from a UTF-8 encoded file and then writes them back to a new file, ensuring proper encoding. No external data is processed in an unsafe manner, and no malicious behaviors such as network access, code execution, or data exfiltration are present. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicates normal operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard property file read/write operations with proper encoding, showing no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
