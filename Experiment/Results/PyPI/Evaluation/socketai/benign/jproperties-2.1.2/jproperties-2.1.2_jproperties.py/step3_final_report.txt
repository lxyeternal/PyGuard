  "purpose": "This code implements a Python module for parsing, reading, and writing Java property files with support for metadata, escape sequences, and command-line interface.",
  "sources": "File input streams, string inputs, environment variables, and user input via CLI.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data read from files or strings, but no external sinks like network or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through parsing functions (_parse, _parse_key, _parse_value) to internal data structures (_properties, _metadata), and then to output streams via store(). No external network or system modification occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Use of eval() limited to safe escape sequences, not arbitrary code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a property file parser/writer, with support for metadata, escape sequences, and CLI. It uses common libraries and patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Error handling is appropriate. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The use of eval() is confined to predefined escape sequences, limiting risk. The code is transparent and well-structured, with no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured property file parser/writer with no malicious or obfuscation signals. It poses negligible security risk and is safe for use in open-source or production environments, assuming code integrity.",
