  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to verify the claims.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- It reads a static README file, sets package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Behavior or Code:**\n- The code solely performs package setup.\n- No code executes untrusted input, network requests, or dynamic code.\n- Reading the README file via `codecs.open` is a common pattern.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n- The code appears correct and standard.\n- The use of `codecs.open` for reading a static file is acceptable, though in modern Python versions `open` with encoding is preferred.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n**3. Scores and Justification:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Comments |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|--------------|----------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0                | 0            | Correct; no malicious or obfuscated code. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0                | 0            | Correct; standard setup script. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0                | 0            | Correct; straightforward configuration. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0                | 0            | Correct; no suspicious behavior. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0                | 0            | Correct; typical setup code. |\n\nAll reports consistently indicate no malicious or obfuscated code, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is justified, as there's no security risk from this setup script.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe provided setup script is a standard, benign Python package configuration file. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe and poses no security threat.",
