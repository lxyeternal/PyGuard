{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'jproperties' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long_description, static package metadata definitions, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Static reading of README file during setup; no dynamic or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and follows common packaging patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script that imports standard modules, reads a static README file, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle untrusted input. The use of 'codecs.open' for reading the README is standard, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. All security signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
