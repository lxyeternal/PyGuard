  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs 'Hello World!' to the console.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static string in print statement.",
  "sinks": "Console output (stdout). No untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Static string passed directly to print function; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward print statement with a static string, containing no external inputs, no data flows, and no complex logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
