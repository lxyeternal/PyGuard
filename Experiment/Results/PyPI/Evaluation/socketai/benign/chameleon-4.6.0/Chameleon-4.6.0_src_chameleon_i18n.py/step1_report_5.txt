{
  "purpose": "This code provides translation and attribute parsing functionalities for internationalization support, including message interpolation and attribute extraction.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly from external modules such as zope.i18n, and input parameters like msgid, attrs, mapping, and default.",
  "sinks": "The interpolate function called within fast_translate (if enabled), and the replace function in simple_translate that processes msgid and mapping data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (msgid, attrs, mapping) flow through translation and parsing functions, with potential interpolation happening via interpolate and regex substitutions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code handles standard translation and parsing logic with exception handling for imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines translation utilities with optional dependency imports. It uses regex for message interpolation, checks for valid attribute formats, and handles default values and mappings carefully. No suspicious code or malicious patterns such as network calls, data exfiltration, or system manipulation are present. The only conditional dynamic import and function definition is for optional translation features, which are standard in i18n implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate internationalization utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly performs safe string manipulations, regex-based substitutions, and attribute parsing. The dependency imports are optional and handled safely. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
