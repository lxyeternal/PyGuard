{
  "purpose": "Provides translation functions, string interpolation, and attribute parsing for internationalization purposes, with optional external library dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input strings (msgid, default, attrs), optional external translation libraries (zope.i18n), regex matches during interpolation.",
  "sinks": "String outputs after translation or interpolation, attribute dictionary, potential exceptions during attribute parsing.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into translation functions or regex substitution, with validation and fallback mechanisms; no external system effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Regex and validation are straightforward and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard internationalization practices, with safe handling of optional dependencies, controlled regex for interpolation, and validation in attribute parsing. No external system calls, network activity, or code injection mechanisms are present. The functions are designed for safe string processing, with fallback mechanisms to prevent errors. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors are evident. The regex used is simple and unlikely to be exploited. The validation raises exceptions on malformed input, indicating secure handling of untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for translation and attribute parsing with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (around 0.1) is justified given its purpose and safeguards.",
