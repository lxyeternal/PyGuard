  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Describes translation and attribute parsing functions for i18n.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code; uses standard practices; external translation libraries are optional with fallback.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, justified by the thorough reasoning.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, well-structured code with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on translation and parsing.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; safe handling of string interpolation and attribute parsing.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; risk is low at 0.2, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard i18n utilities, regex interpolation.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code; uses safe regex patterns; external dependencies are optional.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; risk is low at 0.1, which seems appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard utility code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Translation and attribute parsing.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; safe string handling and validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; risk is 0.2, consistent with the code's scope.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility functions.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar translation and parsing functions.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious activity; safe regex and dependency handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; risk is 0, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Conclusion:** No security threats.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard internationalization utility with translation, interpolation, and attribute parsing functions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk Scores:** Ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern given the code's purpose and implementation.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No evidence of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The regex is straightforward, and the code handles untrusted input with validation and exception handling.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated overall security risk score:** **0.1** (very low, standard utility code)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical internationalization utility, employing safe string handling, optional dependencies, and validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and free from malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
