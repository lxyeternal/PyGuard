  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard i18n functions, safe use of external libraries, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system interaction, data flows are internal string manipulations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Use of regex is straightforward, and fallback mechanisms are safe.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with a very high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on translation and attribute parsing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Inputs influence translation and parsing but do not lead to external system effects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior or suspicious code. Use of external libraries is optional, with safe fallback.\n- **Conclusion:** Also benign, high confidence, malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard i18n utility functions, regex-based interpolation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or system manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code. Uses safe regex for string substitution.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard utility code, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Internationalization functions, optional external libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String interpolation and attribute parsing, with no external system effects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or malicious behavior. Regex and validation are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no security risk, malware 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Translation utilities, safe handling of dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String substitution and attribute parsing, no external effects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code, malware 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely for translation and attribute parsing, with no network, file, or code injection behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk remains low, as the code is a straightforward utility module with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in each report seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The overall **malware score should remain at 0**.\n- The **obfuscated score should be 0**.\n- The **risk score** can be kept low, around 0.1–0.2, reflecting the safe nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThis code appears to be a well-structured, safe internationalization utility with no supply chain security concerns.",
