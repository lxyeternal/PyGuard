  "purpose": "Defines namespace constants for XML and related standards used in an XML processing context.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded namespace URI strings assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; straightforward namespace definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string variable assignments for namespace URIs commonly used in XML and web templating contexts. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or network operations. No secrets, credentials, or suspicious behavior is evident. It appears to be a standard configuration or constants file, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining namespace constants for XML processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
