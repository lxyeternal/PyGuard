  "purpose": "Define namespace constants for XML processing, likely used for parsing or generating XML documents in various XML-based frameworks.",
  "sources": "No input sources; these are hardcoded string constants defining namespace URIs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this snippet; it's purely variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed; no dynamic code or external data references.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several string constants representing XML namespace URIs, common in XML processing libraries. It appears to be standard setup code for handling multiple XML namespaces in a project. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is static and straightforward, with no input, output, or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a typical namespace declaration for XML handling. It shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and likely part of a larger XML processing module.",
