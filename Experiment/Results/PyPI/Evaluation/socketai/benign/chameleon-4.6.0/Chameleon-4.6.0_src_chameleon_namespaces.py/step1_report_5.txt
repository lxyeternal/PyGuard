  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears to be standard namespace declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns URI strings to namespace variables commonly used in XML processing. No dynamic code, input handling, or untrusted data processing is present. The code appears to be straightforward namespace constants setup without any suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is simply defining namespace constants for XML and related technologies, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
