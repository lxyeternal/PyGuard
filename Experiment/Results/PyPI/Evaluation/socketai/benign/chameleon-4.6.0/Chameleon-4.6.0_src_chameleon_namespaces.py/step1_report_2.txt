{
  "purpose": "Define namespace constants for XML and related technologies, likely used for processing or parsing XML documents.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments to namespace variables at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns constant string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of static constant assignments with well-known namespace URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes namespace constants used for XML processing, namespace handling, or templating systems like Zope, Genshi, or similar. There are no dynamic inputs, no suspicious function calls, and no obfuscated or complex code constructs. The namespace URLs are standard and publicly documented. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or unusual activities. The code's scope is limited to defining constants, which is common in XML-related codebases.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet only defines namespace constants with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, legitimate XML or templating processing system.",
