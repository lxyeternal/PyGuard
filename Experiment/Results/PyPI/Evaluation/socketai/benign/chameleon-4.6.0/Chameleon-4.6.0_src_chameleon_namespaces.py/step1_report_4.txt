  "purpose": "Definition of namespace URI constants for XML processing and namespace identification.",
  "sources": "None; these are static string assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static constants with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple variable assignments defining various namespace URIs used in XML processing. There are no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no data manipulation that could lead to security issues. The constants are standard namespace URLs, typical in XML-based applications, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as namespace constants for XML handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
