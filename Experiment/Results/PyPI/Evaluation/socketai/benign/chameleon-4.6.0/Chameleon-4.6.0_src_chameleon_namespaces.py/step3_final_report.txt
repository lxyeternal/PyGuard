  "purpose": "Define static XML namespace URI constants for use in XML processing.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments of namespace URIs, no input or data reading involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no external outputs or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A - static constants, no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments defining well-known XML namespace URIs. There are no dynamic behaviors, user inputs, network activities, or obfuscation. The namespace URLs are standard and publicly documented. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain any suspicious or hidden behavior. The scores are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of namespace constants used in XML processing. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
