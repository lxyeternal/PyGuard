  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or code execution based on external data.\n- Use of importlib.metadata to retrieve package version is standard.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is a typical configuration script for documentation generation.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The dynamic version retrieval is standard practice.\n- No malicious activity, malware, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- None identified. The report's reasoning is sound and consistent with the code.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, code is straightforward.\n- **SecurityRisk score (0):** Correct, no security risks detected.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code is static configuration with no dynamic or external data processing that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- The use of `importlib.metadata` is safe and standard.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- No signs of malicious intent or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n### Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard configuration code for Sphinx documentation. All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious or suspicious elements. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; the code is safe, and the assigned scores reflect that. The overall security posture of this script is very high, with no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
