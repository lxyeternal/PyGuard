  "sources": "Import statements for 'version' from importlib.metadata, sys.path modifications, and variable assignments such as 'chameleon_version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static configuration values are used.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, unusual code, or obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx configuration file. It imports the project version dynamically, sets up paths, and specifies documentation build options. There are no code injection points, no network connections, or data leaks. All operations are static and related solely to documentation generation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard configuration code for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to configure documentation build parameters.",
