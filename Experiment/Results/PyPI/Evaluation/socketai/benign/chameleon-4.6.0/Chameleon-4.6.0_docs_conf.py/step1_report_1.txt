  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation generation for the Chameleon project.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.path modifications, and dynamic version retrieval using importlib.metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is used in a way that affects system security or leaks data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from sources to sinks that could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.metadata to dynamically get package version, which is standard; no suspicious code, backdoors, or hidden behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file. It imports standard modules, appends paths for module discovery, and retrieves package version info dynamically, which is a common pattern for maintainability. No code executes untrusted input, performs network communication, or manipulates data insecurely. The configuration options set parameters for documentation build, including themes, extensions, and output formats, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration setup without any suspicious activity.",
