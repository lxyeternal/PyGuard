  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building documentation for the Chameleon project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import of 'version' from 'importlib.metadata', sys.path modifications, and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; configuration variables are static.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard Sphinx configuration file with no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version information and appends directories to sys.path, both typical for Sphinx configuration. No user input or external data is processed dynamically. No network activity, credential handling, or code execution beyond static configuration occurs. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and standard for documentation setup. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malware indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration file used for documentation purposes. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
