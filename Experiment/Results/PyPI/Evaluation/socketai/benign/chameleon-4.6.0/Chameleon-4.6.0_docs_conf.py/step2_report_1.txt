  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- The code imports standard modules (`importlib.metadata`, `sys`, `os`), modifies `sys.path`, and retrieves the package version dynamically.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated/malicious code are detected.\n- The code is purely configuration for documentation generation.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n  **This seems reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Sphinx configuration file.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; the code is standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n  **This is appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Sphinx configuration setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n  **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Sphinx documentation configuration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n  **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Documentation build setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard configuration, no issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n  **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is consistent and justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Scores are consistent and reasonable** across all reports.\n- The code is **benign, standard, and safe**.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard Sphinx configuration file with no security concerns.",
