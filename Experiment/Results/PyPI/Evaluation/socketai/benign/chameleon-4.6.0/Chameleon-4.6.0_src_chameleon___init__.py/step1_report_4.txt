  "purpose": "Re-exporting classes and exceptions from the chameleon.template modules for easier import elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the chameleon.exc and chameleon.zpt modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could leak information or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and static with no dynamic execution or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and exceptions from the chameleon package and then declares an __all__ list for public API exposure. There is no data input, no processing, and no side effects. The code appears to be a module for organizing exports, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely to re-export selected classes and exceptions, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign module with no security concerns.",
