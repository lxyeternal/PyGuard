{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and exceptions from the 'chameleon' library modules, likely to facilitate template rendering or processing within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'chameleon' library modules (chameleon.exc, chameleon.zpt.loader, chameleon.zpt.template).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from sources to sinks as there are only imports and an __all__ declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code consists solely of import statements and an export list.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes and exceptions from the 'chameleon' templating library and declares an __all__ list for module exports. There are no function definitions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No indicators of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of import statements and an export list defining publicly accessible classes and exceptions. It appears to be part of a module setup for template handling. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
