{
  "purpose": "The code imports various classes and exceptions from the chameleon templating library, likely for use in template rendering and error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the chameleon.exc and chameleon.zpt modules, specifically importing exception and template classes.",
  "stakes": "No untrusted input handling, network operations, or data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A – The code solely performs imports and defines an export list; no data flow or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. All imports are from a standard third-party library; no suspicious or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly imports specific classes and exceptions from the chameleon library, which is a known templating engine. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. The __all__ variable clearly specifies exported symbols, indicating a controlled module interface. No signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior, and no suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module that imports necessary classes for template handling from the chameleon library. It does not contain malicious code, malware, or security risks. The snippet appears safe and standard.",
