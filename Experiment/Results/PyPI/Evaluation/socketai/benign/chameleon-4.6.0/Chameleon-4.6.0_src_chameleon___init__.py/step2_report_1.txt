  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward set of import statements from the 'chameleon' templating library, with an `__all__` declaration.\n   - No report indicates any suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code.\n   - The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data.\n   - The code appears to be a module setup for exporting specific classes and exceptions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are identified in the reports.\n   - The code is simple and standard for organizing module exports.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks:**\n   - Since the code is purely import/export declarations, the risk is negligible.\n   - The code does not introduce supply chain vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security threats.\n   - The high confidence scores are justified.\n   - The malware score remains at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and purely organizational.",
