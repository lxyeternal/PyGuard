{
  "purpose": "To import specific classes and exceptions from the 'chameleon' templating library and define an explicit export list for module organization.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'chameleon' library modules",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or dynamic execution present",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export declarations with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from a well-known templating library and an __all__ list defining exported symbols. No functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is a standard module setup for organizing exports, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its benign nature. Given the absence of any suspicious elements, the code poses no security threat or supply chain risk beyond reliance on the trustworthiness of the external library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for re-exporting classes and exceptions from the 'chameleon' library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive behavior. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
