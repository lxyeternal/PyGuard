  "purpose": "Define a whitelist of XML or macro-related strings, likely for validating or filtering input.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input reading or data sources present in the code.",
  "targets": "None; no data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow since there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a straightforward whitelist definition with no unusual or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a license notice and defines a frozenset named WHITELIST containing specific string identifiers related to macros and XML namespaces. It is a static data structure without any input handling, data processing, or external interactions. There are no code execution, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign configuration or constant definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger codebase that uses this whitelist for validation purposes.",
