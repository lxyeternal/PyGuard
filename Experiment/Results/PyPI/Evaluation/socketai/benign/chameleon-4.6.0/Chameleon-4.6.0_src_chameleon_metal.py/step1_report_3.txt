  "sources": "No input data sources; the code is defining a constant set.",
  "targets": "No sinks; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Nothing unusual or suspicious; the code appears to be a straightforward set definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that declares a frozenset containing specific string literals related to macros and XML namespaces. It includes license and copyright information, but no code execution, input handling, or data manipulation is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code inclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static configuration or constant set for whitelisting purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
