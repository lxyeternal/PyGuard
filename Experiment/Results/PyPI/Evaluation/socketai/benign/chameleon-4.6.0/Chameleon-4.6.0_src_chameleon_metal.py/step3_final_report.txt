  "purpose": "Define a static whitelist of XML and macro-related strings for validation or filtering purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a static declaration of a frozenset.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is purely declarative with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with licensing comments and a static set.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static declaration of a frozenset containing specific strings related to macros and XML namespaces. It includes licensing comments but no dynamic code, input/output, or external data handling. The purpose appears to be for validation, filtering, or configuration within a larger system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's benign and static nature. The code poses minimal security risk and contains no malicious intent or obfuscation. The analysis confirms that the code is safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static whitelist declaration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
