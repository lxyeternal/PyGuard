{
  "purpose": "Define a whitelist of XML-related keywords or tags, likely for validation or filtering purposes.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points, as there are no untrusted data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The only notable aspect is the use of a frozenset for storing the whitelist, which is standard for immutability.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static immutable set of strings, likely for validation or filtering purposes related to XML or macro processing. There are no input sources, data sinks, or suspicious behaviors such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration or constant definition for a whitelist, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
