  "purpose": "Define a whitelist of XML or macro-related keywords for validation or filtering purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static definition within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no data output or processing of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a constant set.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a straightforward static set definition with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing comments, then defines a frozenset containing specific string literals related to macros and XML namespaces. There are no dynamic elements, no input handling, no external data processing, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to serve as a static configuration or whitelist. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static whitelist definition with licensing information. It poses no security risks, does not contain malware, and does not exhibit obfuscation. It is purely declarative.",
