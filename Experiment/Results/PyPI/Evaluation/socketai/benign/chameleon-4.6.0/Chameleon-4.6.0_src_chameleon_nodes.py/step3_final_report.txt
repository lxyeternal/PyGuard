{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of classes representing nodes in an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for a macro/template processing system. It serves as a structural schema for parsing or manipulating templates and macros, with no runtime logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with fields such as 'expression', 'name', 'value', etc., representing syntax nodes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not read external input, write output, or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the classes are data containers without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and purely structural.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for AST nodes, with type annotations and data fields. It lacks any dynamic execution, external data handling, or runtime logic. The absence of code injection, network activity, or obfuscated constructs indicates a benign, structural purpose. All signals point to the code being a schema for parsing or representing templates/macros, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structural set of class definitions for an AST in a macro/template system. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be set to zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk, reflecting its safe and static nature.",
