{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of classes representing nodes for a templating or code parsing system, including macro handling, conditions, and various expression types.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; class attributes and methods operate on internal data structures. No data input handling present.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no external data sinks, network operations, or data output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; classes are data structures without executable flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a structured definition of node classes with no dynamic execution or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely class definitions for a node-based structure, likely for a template parser or code generator. It contains no input handling, network operations, file I/O, or other side effects. No dynamic code execution, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The classes are well-structured data containers with no evident malicious intent or security risks. Usage of class attributes and type hints is standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code constitutes a set of data structure definitions for a parsing or templating system. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. The code is safe and intended for use within a larger application context.",
