  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'Chameleon', configuring metadata, dependencies, and custom test commands.",
  "sources": "Reads static documentation files ('README.rst', 'CHANGES.rst'), imports standard libraries, and defines dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static data usage; no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads files for metadata; no flow of untrusted input to critical functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward setup code; no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, with static file reads and standard dependency declarations. No external inputs are processed insecurely, no network connections, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The only minor mention of environment variables relates to Python version requirements, which is standard and does not introduce risk. All signals indicate benign, well-structured package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible, approximately 0.0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
