  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, the reasoning, and the provided scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a regex-based XML lexer/parser.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external system interaction is present.\n- Regex patterns are static, compiled at import time.\n- The Token class extends string with metadata, used for parsing and string manipulation.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are evident.\n- Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all low or zero across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issue presence:** No issues are detected in the code based on the reports. The code is a standard regex-based XML lexer.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports find evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present.\n- **Code correctness:** The code performs regex compilation, tokenization, and string manipulation safely.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: between 0.1 and 0.2\n- These are consistent with the analysis: the code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated features.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The risk scores are very low, which aligns with the analysis that the code is a benign XML lexer.\n- The only potential concern is the extensive regex usage, but that is typical for lexers and not inherently risky.\n\n### Critical points:\n- **No suspicious claims:** The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a safe XML lexing utility.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, due to regex complexity but no inherent danger)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to regex complexity but no actual risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, static regex-based XML lexer with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores provided in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code's behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and assign a very low security risk score (~0.1), reflecting the regex complexity but no actual security threat.",
