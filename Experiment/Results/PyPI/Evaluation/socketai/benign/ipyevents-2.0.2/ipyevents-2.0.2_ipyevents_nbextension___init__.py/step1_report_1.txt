  "purpose": "Defines a function for Jupyter Notebook extension configuration paths",
  "sources": "The function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() returns a list of dictionaries specifying extension paths and requirements",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no network or file I/O operations",
  "flows": "The function simply returns static data; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and contains no unusual or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that returns a static configuration dictionary for a Jupyter Notebook extension. It does not read external input, perform any network operations, or contain any dynamic code execution. The license comment indicates authorship but does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be standard extension configuration code with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration stub for a Jupyter Notebook extension without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
