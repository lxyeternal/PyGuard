  "purpose": "Provide configuration for Jupyter Notebook nbextension paths.",
  "sources": "Function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() returns a dictionary defining extension paths and requirements.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function simply returns static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward and appears to be standard extension configuration; no unusual code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that returns static configuration information for a Jupyter Notebook extension. It does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or data processing. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated code are present. The code is minimal and standard for Jupyter nbextensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration snippet for Jupyter Notebook extension paths. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks.",
