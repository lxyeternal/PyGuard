  "purpose": "Define a function to specify Jupyter Notebook extension paths for the 'ipyevents' package.",
  "sources": "Function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() that returns a list of dictionaries specifying extension configuration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "The function returns static configuration data without processing untrusted input; no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function returning static configuration data for Jupyter Notebook extension setup. It includes a copyright notice but no suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks performing sensitive operations, and no data flows indicating malicious activity. The code appears to be part of a standard extension setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a simple configuration purpose for a Jupyter extension. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
