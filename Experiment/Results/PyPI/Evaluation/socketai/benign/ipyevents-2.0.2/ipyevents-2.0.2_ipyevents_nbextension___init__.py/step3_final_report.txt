  "purpose": "Provides extension configuration paths for a Jupyter Notebook extension.",
  "sources": "The function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() returning static data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving external input or untrusted sources; static return value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static data return, no obfuscation, no secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function returning a static list of dictionaries with extension configuration paths. It contains no dynamic input, external data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The license comment indicates authorship but does not suggest malicious intent. All signals point to benign, standard configuration code. No suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration snippet for a Jupyter Notebook extension. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and analysis are justified and consistent. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
