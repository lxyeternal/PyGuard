{
  "purpose": "Minimal setup script that dynamically imports setuptools and calls setup() for package configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only performs an import and function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no data leaks or external effects occur.",
  "flows": "The import of 'setuptools' and invocation of 'setup()' are isolated; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, minimal setup script that imports 'setuptools' dynamically and calls 'setup()' without parameters. It does not process external data, handle user input, or perform network activity. The pattern is common in Python packaging and poses no security risks. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The small security risk scores in some reports (0.1) are overly cautious; given the code's simplicity, the risk is effectively zero. Malware activity is absent, and the code is transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of security issues. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0 for an accurate assessment.",
