  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for Python packages, used to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it simply imports and runs setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; the code does not pass data to sinks that could cause vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as the code performs a single import and function call without data processing",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the script is minimal and straightforward, serving a standard purpose",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools module and calls its setup() function, which is a common pattern for Python package setup scripts. It does not include any user input, environment variable processing, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
