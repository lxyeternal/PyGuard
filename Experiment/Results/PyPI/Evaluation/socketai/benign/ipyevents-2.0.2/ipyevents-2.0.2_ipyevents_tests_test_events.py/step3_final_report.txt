{
  "purpose": "The code consists of unit tests for the ipyevents.Event class, validating event registration, property validation, callback management, and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from hardcoded test values and function parameters within test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code does not perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves setting properties and invoking methods on the Event object with controlled test data, then asserting expected outcomes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward testing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests verifying the behavior of the Event class, including validation of event names, wait times, coordinate systems, and callback handling. It uses standard testing practices with no external data processing or malicious constructs. No evidence of code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration is found. The tests only operate on internal, controlled data and validate expected behaviors and error conditions. The code is clear, readable, and adheres to best practices, with no obfuscation or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for the Event class, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
