  "purpose": "Unit tests for the ipyevents.Event class, verifying event handling, property setting, validation, and callback management.",
  "sources": "pytest framework imports, ipyevents.Event import",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; no network, file, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input to class properties and methods during tests, with no external data flow or untrusted data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward test code using standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of unit tests for a widget class, primarily invoking class methods and setting properties with valid and invalid values. It employs standard exception handling and assertions. No code appears to perform network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No obfuscated or malicious logic is present. All operations are typical for test code, with proper validation and error handling. No signs of supply chain attacks or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of unit tests for the ipyevents.Event class, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be standard testing code verifying class functionality and validation logic only.",
