  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of unit tests for the `ipyevents.Event` class.\n- They emphasize the absence of malicious behavior, external data leaks, network activity, obfuscated code, or backdoors.\n- The code performs standard validation, exception handling, and callback management.\n- No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious constructs are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Presence\n- The code snippets match the described tests: event name validation, wait time validation, coordinate setting, callback handling, etc.\n- No discrepancies between the reports and the code.\n\n### Logical & Reasoning Flaws\n- The reports correctly identify that the tests validate expected behaviors and exception raising.\n- No flawed reasoning or incorrect conclusions are evident.\n- The tests are straightforward and typical for such a widget class.\n\n### Scores Evaluation\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clean, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, justified by the lack of external data flow, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n### Specific Points\n- The reports mention that the code only validates class properties, methods, and exception handling.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are made; the analysis is cautious and appropriate.\n- The validation of invalid inputs and error handling is standard and does not indicate security issues.\n\n### Potential Overestimations or Underestimations\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0.5, but all reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n- Malware score is consistently 0, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n\n### Final Assessment\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the scores provided: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of unit tests.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The reports' reasoning and scores are accurate and justified.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \n**Scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.**",
