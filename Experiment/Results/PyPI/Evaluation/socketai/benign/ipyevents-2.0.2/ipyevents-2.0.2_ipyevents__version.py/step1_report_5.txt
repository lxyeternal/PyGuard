  "purpose": "Define and assign version information and version specifier for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The version_info tuple, the _specifier_ dictionary, and the __version__ string formation.",
  "sinks": "The __version__ string, which may be used elsewhere, but here is simply constructed; no untrusted input or data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "The version_info tuple is used to format the __version__ string, referencing _specifier_ for non-final versions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. The code constructs version strings statically. No dynamic code execution or external data is used.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version_info tuple and a mapping dictionary for version suffixes. It then constructs a __version__ string based on these values. The EXTENSION_SPEC_VERSION is statically assigned. There are no sources of untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious logic, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard version management logic for a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, solely managing version information with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs static data formatting without external dependencies or dynamic behavior.",
