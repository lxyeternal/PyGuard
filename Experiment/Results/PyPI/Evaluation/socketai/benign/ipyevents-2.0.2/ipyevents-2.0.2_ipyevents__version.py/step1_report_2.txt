  "purpose": "Define version information and version specifier for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Read the version_info tuple and _specifier_ dictionary for version components and mappings.",
  "sinks": "Generate __version__ string dynamically based on version_info; assign a static version string to EXTENSION_SPEC_VERSION.",
  "flows": "Version components are read from version_info and _specifier_; __version__ is constructed; EXTENSION_SPEC_VERSION is assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a version string dynamically from a tuple and a mapping dictionary, which is standard practice. The _specifier_ dictionary maps version qualifiers to abbreviations. The version string (__version__) is created via string formatting, and a static extension version is assigned. No external input, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected. The code serves a versioning purpose only and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version information setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply constructs version strings for package identification. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present.",
