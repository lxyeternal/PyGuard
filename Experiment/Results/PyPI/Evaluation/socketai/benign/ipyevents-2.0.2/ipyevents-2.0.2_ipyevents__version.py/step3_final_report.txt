{
  "purpose": "Constructs a version string based on predefined version components and maps version qualifiers to abbreviations for consistent version formatting.",
  "sources": "The 'version_info' tuple and the '_specifier_' dictionary serve as sources for version components and qualifiers.",
  "sinks": "The constructed '__version__' string is the output sink, but it is derived solely from static, predefined variables without external input.",
  "flows": "The version components from 'version_info' flow through string formatting to produce '__version__'. No external data flows into the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is static, straightforward, and lacks dynamic or obfuscated elements. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static version information and a mapping for version qualifiers. It constructs a version string via simple string formatting, with all data being predefined and constant. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The static 'EXTENSION_SPEC_VERSION' further indicates standard versioning practice. The code's simplicity and clarity, along with the absence of suspicious behavior, support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version string management snippet with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and justified.",
