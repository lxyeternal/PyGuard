  "purpose": "Define and generate the package version string based on version_info and version specifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads version_info tuple and _specifier_ dictionary to construct __version__ string; reads static string for EXTENSION_SPEC_VERSION.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Constructs __version__ by combining elements from version_info and _specifier_; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly defines version information and constructs version strings based on predefined tuples and dictionaries. It includes comments clarifying purpose. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. No malicious behavior or suspicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely handles version string construction with static data and simple string formatting. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
