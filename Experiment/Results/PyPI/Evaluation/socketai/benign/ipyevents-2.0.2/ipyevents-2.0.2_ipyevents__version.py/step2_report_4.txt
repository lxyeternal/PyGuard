  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a `version_info` tuple with version components.\n   - It defines a `_specifier_` dictionary mapping version qualifiers to abbreviations.\n   - It constructs a `__version__` string based on these variables.\n   - It assigns a static string to `EXTENSION_SPEC_VERSION`.\n   \n   All of these are standard practices for version management in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements**:\n   - No external input, user data, or untrusted sources are involved.\n   - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is static and straightforward.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is standard version handling logic.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n   - The scores assigned (`malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`) are consistent with the code content.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:\n   - Since the code performs simple, static string formatting based on predefined variables, the risk is negligible.\n   - No malware or malicious activity is present or implied.\n   - The code does not involve any obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Adjustments**:\n   - The current scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n6. **Overall Summary**:\n   - The code is a typical version management snippet.\n   - No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are evident.\n   - The provided scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (No malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (No security risk detected)\n\n**My own estimates** align with the reports: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is benign, standard, and secure. No further action or concern is warranted.",
