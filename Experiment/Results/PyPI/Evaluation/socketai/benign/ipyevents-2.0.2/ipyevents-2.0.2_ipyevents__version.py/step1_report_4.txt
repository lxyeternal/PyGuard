  "purpose": "Define version information and format for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads predefined tuples and dictionaries for version components and version specifiers.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs a version string and assigns a constant version value; no untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "The version_info tuple and _specifier_ dictionary flow into string formatting to produce __version__, and a static value is assigned to EXTENSION_SPEC_VERSION.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward, involving version string construction.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version_info as a tuple with version components, then uses string formatting to create a version string __version__. It also defines a dictionary for version suffixes and assigns a static version string to EXTENSION_SPEC_VERSION. All operations are static, involve no user input, external data, or cryptic behaviors. The code appears to be standard version management logic with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely handles version information formatting with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It is safe and appears to be standard version management code.",
