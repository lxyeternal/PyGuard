  "purpose": "Defines version information and constructs a version string for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Variables 'version_info', '_specifier_', and the string formatting line that constructs '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "The constructed '__version__' string, which could potentially be used in logging or display outputs.",
  "flows": "Reads from 'version_info' and '_specifier_' to generate '__version__'. No external or untrusted input is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The version string is constructed from predefined variables without dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a tuple 'version_info' with version components, maps version suffixes via '_specifier_', and constructs '__version__' using string formatting. No external input, no code injection, and no obfuscated code are present. It simply formats version information based on predefined variables. The 'EXTENSION_SPEC_VERSION' is a static string, likely for internal use. Overall, the code performs straightforward version management without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet solely manages version information and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. It is standard version handling logic with no security concerns.",
