  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is purely for version string management.\n- No external input, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- The logic is straightforward: define version info, map suffixes, and construct version strings.\n- The static `EXTENSION_SPEC_VERSION` is also safe and standard.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n\n**Security Risk and Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified.\n- The risk scores are all 0.0, which seems reasonable given the code's simplicity and static nature.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues found. The code is standard version management logic with no security concerns.\n- The detailed reasoning supports that the code is benign.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed to the scoring.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk involved)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe version string management snippet with no security concerns. The current scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
