  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard Sphinx config; static setup with no external data or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious activity, no external communication, no data leaks. The embedded HTML/LaTeX in `nbsphinx_prolog` is typical for documentation customization.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign configuration.\n\n**Assessment:** The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard static configuration, no external data or suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious activity detected. The embedded HTML/JavaScript is for UI purposes.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign configuration.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard configuration; no external data flow or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no signs of malicious behavior. The embedded code is for documentation features.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more attention on the embedded JavaScript that constructs URLs dynamically.\n- **Potential concern:** Dynamic JavaScript could be exploited if the source code were compromised, but in the context of a static configuration file, this is standard practice.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (minor concern due to dynamic JS)\n- **Analysis:** The dynamic JavaScript in `nbsphinx_prolog` is typical for interactive documentation features. While it could theoretically be exploited if modified maliciously, in the given context, it is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; the slight security risk score is justified as a minor potential vector but not actual malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are reasonable; the risk score could be slightly higher if considering the dynamic JS, but 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; embedded HTML/JavaScript for UI, no external data flow.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious activity. The embedded code is for documentation display.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is static, configuration for documentation with embedded HTML/JavaScript.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; all scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Minor in one report due to dynamic JavaScript, but overall very low.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable configuration.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to dynamic JavaScript, but overall negligible.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration with embedded HTML/JavaScript for documentation purposes. No malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided configuration files are safe, standard documentation setup with no malicious activity. The minor security risk score in one report is justified but does not indicate actual malware or vulnerability.",
