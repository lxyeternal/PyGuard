  "purpose": "Configuration for Sphinx documentation builder with embedded HTML/JavaScript for interactive features.",
  "sources": "Static configuration variables; embedded HTML and JavaScript in 'nbsphinx_prolog'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The 'nbsphinx_prolog' contains dynamic JavaScript that constructs URLs based on the current document context, which could be exploited if the code were altered maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Sphinx configuration file with embedded HTML and JavaScript for documentation features. No external data input, code execution, or network activity occurs at runtime. The embedded JavaScript dynamically generates links, which is standard for documentation tools but could be a minor attack vector if the source code is compromised. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation are present. The overall structure is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration with embedded HTML/JavaScript for documentation purposes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The slight risk score (around 0.2) due to dynamic JavaScript is justified but does not indicate malicious intent.",
