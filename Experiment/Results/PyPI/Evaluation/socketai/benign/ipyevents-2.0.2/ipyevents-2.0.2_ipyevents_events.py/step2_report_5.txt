  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the described logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines a widget class 'Event' for handling browser events, with validation, callback registration, and message handling. No suspicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The report's confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The validation and callback mechanisms are standard. The security risk is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code reads configuration, registers callbacks, and validates event types. No external data exfiltration or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (slightly above zero but still low).\n\n- **Assessment:** The slight increase in securityRisk (0.2) seems reasonable given the callback mechanism, but no actual malicious activity is present. The code does not process untrusted data maliciously.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard widget for handling browser events, with proper validation and callback registration. No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The score of 0 for malware and obfuscated code is justified. The securityRisk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** The widget handles browser events, with validation, callback registration, and message dispatch. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score is appropriate. The code is standard and does not contain malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with validation, callback registration, and event handling. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The scores seem reasonable. The code's design is typical for such widgets.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious activity, external communication, or code injection.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are acceptable, reflecting minimal risk associated with callback handling and event validation, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to callback mechanisms and validation, but no actual threat.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented widget for handling browser events in Jupyter notebooks. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements are present.",
