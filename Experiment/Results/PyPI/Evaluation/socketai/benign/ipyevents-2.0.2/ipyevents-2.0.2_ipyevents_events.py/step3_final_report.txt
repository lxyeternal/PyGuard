{
  "purpose": "A Python class defining a Jupyter widget for handling browser events with validation, callback registration, and message dispatching.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, event types, and callback functions; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Invokes registered callbacks with event data; no data exfiltration or external communication.",
  "flows": "Event data flows from DOM events to internal handlers, then to registered callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a Jupyter widget for browser event handling. It includes validation for event types and coordinate systems, callback registration via a dispatcher, and message handling. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious code patterns are present. The validation functions ensure only supported event types and coordinate systems are used. The callback dispatcher manages user-defined functions invoked upon events. The overall structure is clear, with proper separation of concerns and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured widget class for handling browser events in Jupyter notebooks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, primarily reflecting the inherent potential for callback misuse rather than actual malicious activity.",
