{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization script, importing version information, event handlers, and Jupyter extension paths from internal modules to set up the package environment.",
  "sources": "Internal modules: ._version, .events, and .nbextension, from which version info, event handlers, and extension paths are imported.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only performs static imports without processing external input or data.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing internal attributes and modules; no data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of straightforward import statements with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static set of import statements for internal modules related to versioning, event handling, and Jupyter extension configuration. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's benign nature is consistent with standard package setup routines. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores across all reports are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
