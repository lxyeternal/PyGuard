  "purpose": "Import version information, events, and Jupyter nbextension paths for module functionality",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_version, events, _jupyter_nbextension_paths)",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; imports are static and do not involve untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely static imports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior; straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules and attributes. There are no dynamic or malicious constructs present. No user input handling, network activity, or code execution occurs here. The code appears to serve to expose certain module attributes and functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import pattern used to organize module exports. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a Python package initialization.",
