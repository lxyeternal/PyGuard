{
  "purpose": "Importing version information, event handlers, and Jupyter notebook extension configurations",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: ._version, .events, and .nbextension",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could be processed or leaked",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; primarily static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior; imports are straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code only imports version info, event handlers, and Jupyter extension paths from internal modules. No dynamic execution, network activity, or external data processing is present. The code structure appears standard for a package's initialization or configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement module with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to serve as a configuration or initialization script for a package.",
