  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Content**  \n   All reports describe the same code snippet, which consists solely of import statements:\n   ```python\n   from ._version import version_info, __version__\n   from .events import *\n   from .nbextension import _jupyter_nbextension_paths\n   ```\n   There are no other operations, no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns**  \n   - **Malicious code or malware:** None of the reports identify any malicious behavior. The code is standard for package initialization, importing version info, event handlers, and extension paths.\n   - **Obfuscation:** All reports indicate the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n   - **External data or untrusted sources:** The code only imports from internal modules, which is typical and safe.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: the code is benign, with no suspicious activity.\n   - The reasoning is sound; static imports without side effects or external data handling are standard practice.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n   - **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear.\n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Justification for Scores**  \n   - Since the code is purely import statements, the risk is negligible.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code's simplicity makes it inherently safe.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment and Recommendations**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No changes are necessary; the scores reflect the code's security posture correctly.\n\n**Final Expert Judgment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard module import section with no security concerns.",
