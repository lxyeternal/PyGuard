  "purpose": "Defines a pytest fixture to mark tests as expected failures (xfail) during runtime.",
  "sources": "Imports pytest; uses request object to add xfail marker to the test node.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input sources; no sensitive data handling; no external network operations.",
  "flows": "pytest fixture creates a closure _xfail that adds an xfail marker to the test node when invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and typical for pytest usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines a fixture 'runtime_xfail' that provides a nested function '_xfail' to mark a test as expected to fail, optionally with a reason. It uses the 'request' fixture to modify the test node, adding an xfail marker. No suspicious or malicious patterns, external calls, or insecure behaviors are present. The code serves a testing utility purpose only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest fixture for marking tests as expected failures at runtime. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
