  "purpose": "Provide a pytest fixture to mark tests as expected failures (xfail) at runtime.",
  "sources": "The code reads the request object passed into the fixture to add a marker.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to cause data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The fixture creates a nested function _xfail that adds an xfail marker to the test request node.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest fixture named runtime_xfail which returns a function _xfail. When invoked, _xfail adds an xfail marker to the current test node with an optional reason. The purpose is to mark tests as expected to fail during runtime. The code uses standard pytest features and does not involve external data sources, network activity, or any malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward utility fixture for pytest to mark tests as expected failures dynamically. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this code.",
