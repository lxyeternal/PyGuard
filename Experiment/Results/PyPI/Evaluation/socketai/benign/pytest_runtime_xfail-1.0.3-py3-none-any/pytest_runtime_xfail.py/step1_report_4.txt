{
  "purpose": "This code defines a pytest fixture for marking tests as expected failures (xfail).",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'request' object from pytest to modify test nodes.",
  "sinks": "The code could potentially influence test reporting but does not directly affect system state or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The fixture returns a function that adds an xfail marker to a test node, which is invoked during test execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and typical for pytest fixtures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines a fixture 'runtime_xfail' that, when called within a test, marks that test as expected to fail. It utilizes pytest's 'add_marker' method to add an 'xfail' marker with an optional reason. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code's structure and functions are typical for test configuration and do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest fixture intended to mark tests as expected failures. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
