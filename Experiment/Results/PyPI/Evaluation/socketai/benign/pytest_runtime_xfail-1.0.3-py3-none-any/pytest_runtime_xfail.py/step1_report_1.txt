{
  "purpose": "The code provides a pytest fixture that marks a test as expected to fail (xfail).",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'request' object provided by pytest when the fixture is invoked.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions; the code only interacts with pytest's API to add a test marker.",
  "flows": "The 'runtime_xfail' fixture receives a 'request' object, defines a function '_xfail' that adds an xfail marker to the test node, and returns this function for use in tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard pytest APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple pytest fixture that allows tests to be marked as expected to fail by calling the returned '_xfail' function with an optional reason. There is no input sanitization or external data processing involved. No suspicious code, external network activity, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended to assist in test management by marking tests as expected failures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
