{
  "purpose": "Provides a pytest fixture to mark tests as expected failures (xfail) during runtime.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it accesses the request object provided by pytest.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, code execution, or other vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The fixture creates a function that, when called, adds an xfail marker to the current test node, which is safe and standard in pytest.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest fixture 'runtime_xfail' that, when invoked within a test, marks that test as expected to fail. It uses pytest's standard API without executing untrusted code or doing anything suspicious. No external data sources, no sinks, and no complex control flows that could hide malicious intent. The purpose is to facilitate dynamic test management, which is a common testing practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe pytest utility for marking tests as expected to fail. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
