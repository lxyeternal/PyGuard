  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward pytest fixture that adds an xfail marker to a test node.\n- It uses standard pytest APIs (`request.node.add_marker(pytest.mark.xfail(reason=reason))`).\n- There are no external inputs, no network activity, no data leaks, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The purpose is to facilitate test management, which is a common practice.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The reports consistently rate the security risk, malware, and obfuscated scores as zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: it defines a fixture that returns a function `_xfail`, which when called, marks the current test as expected to fail.\n- No issues are present in the logic or implementation.\n- The code does not execute untrusted code, process external data, or perform any harmful actions.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty about the benign nature.\n- The purpose and analysis are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code only interacts with pytest's API and does not process external data, it cannot be malicious or vulnerable in itself.\n- The only minor consideration is that, if misused, marking tests as expected to fail could hide issues, but this is a testing utility, not a security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a very low risk, as it influences test behavior but does not pose security issues)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is a standard testing utility with no security concerns.",
