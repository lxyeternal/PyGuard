{
  "purpose": "Provides a pytest fixture to mark tests as expected to fail (xfail) during runtime.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; interacts only with pytest's request object to add a marker.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; no potential data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The fixture returns a function that, when invoked, adds an xfail marker to the current test node.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard pytest APIs without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple pytest fixture that returns a function to mark tests as expected to fail. It does not process external data, execute network operations, or manipulate system state beyond test metadata. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest utility fixture with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
