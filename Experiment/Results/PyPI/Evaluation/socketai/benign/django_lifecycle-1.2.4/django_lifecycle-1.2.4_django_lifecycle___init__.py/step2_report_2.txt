  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __author_email__).\n- Imports various internal modules: constants, decorators, hooks, mixins, models.\n- Declares __all__ to specify public API.\n\n**Security Review:**\n- No data input/output, network activity, or external data handling.\n- No suspicious code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.\n- The email address is publicly visible but not malicious.\n- The code appears to be a typical package module setup for a Python project related to lifecycle hooks and models.\n\n**Evaluation of the Reports:**\n- All five reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n- They correctly identify that the code is static, with no data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security issues or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, standard module setup code.\n- No changes needed to the scores or assessments.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses provided and the nature of the code.",
