  "purpose": "Module setup and export definitions for a Python package related to lifecycle hooks and models.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __author_email__), internal module imports (.constants, .decorators, .hooks, .mixins, .models).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external input/output, or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static import and export declarations; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package module, defining metadata, importing internal components, and specifying public API via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could pose security risks. Multiple reviews confirm its benign nature, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The email address is publicly visible but not malicious. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, benign code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured module setup for a Python package, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behaviors. All reports and analyses agree on its safety, and no changes to the scores or assessment are necessary.",
