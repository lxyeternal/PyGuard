{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that manages lifecycle hooks and models, likely for a web framework or ORM system.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.constants, .decorators, .hooks, .mixins, .models) and metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __author_email__).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file I/O, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets beyond standard metadata. The code solely exports functions and classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines versioning, author information, and imports various modules related to lifecycle hooks and models. It then declares __all__ for exports. There are no input operations, network calls, or sensitive data handling. No suspicious logic or behaviors are present. The code appears to be boilerplate module setup with standard practices. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup for a Python package, primarily defining exports and importing internal components. There are no malicious behaviors, security issues, or anomalies detected. It appears safe and benign.",
