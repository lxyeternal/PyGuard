{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package defining hooks and lifecycle models for a framework or ORM, facilitating event-driven operations.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and constants, primarily from within the package itself. No external data input is involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are explicitly present in this snippet; it mainly defines imports, constants, and exports.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows or untrusted data handling, as the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden logic. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining module metadata, importing internal components, and setting __all__ for exports. It does not perform any data processing, external input handling, or potentially dangerous operations. The structure and content are typical for a Python package module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for organizing and exporting hooks and lifecycle models. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intentionally designed for framework support.",
