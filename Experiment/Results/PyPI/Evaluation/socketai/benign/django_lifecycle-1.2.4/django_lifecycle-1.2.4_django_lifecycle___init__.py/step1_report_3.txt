{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that sets up imports and exports for a lifecycle model system, including hooks and mixins, likely for a larger application framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __author_email__) and imports from internal modules and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted data processing, network communication, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code mainly imports and exports definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets beyond typical metadata, or suspicious behavior. The module primarily manages imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and imports various components related to lifecycle hooks and models. All data is static, hardcoded, and local to the package. No dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity is present. The code structure indicates a typical setup for a Python package's init or module file, with no apparent security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply manages internal references within a package.",
