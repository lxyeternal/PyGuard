{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for hooked methods with prioritization, likely used for callback or event handling systems.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present; code relies on class attributes and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling detected; no network, file, or system operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks identified; code is purely structural and abstract.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of abstract base classes and dataclasses is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with a comparable method based on priority. It uses Python's ABC and dataclasses modules appropriately. No code execution, network access, or data manipulation occurs. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The structure suggests a plugin or callback system, but nothing suspicious is embedded.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious abstract class definition with no apparent security issues. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors.",
