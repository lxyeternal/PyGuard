{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for hooked methods with prioritization and comparison features.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or output sinks are present; the code does not process external inputs or write outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the class provides structure for extension but no execution paths are shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with dataclass decoration, including an abstract property 'name' and an abstract method 'run'. The class implements comparison logic based on 'priority'. It appears to be a structural framework for hooking methods, with no dynamic execution, input/output handling, or suspicious patterns. The code uses standard Python features appropriately and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a clean, straightforward abstract base class for hooks with priority comparison. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions as intended for extension in larger systems without introducing security risks.",
