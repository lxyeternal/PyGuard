{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for hooked methods with priority-based comparison, facilitating extensibility in callback systems.",
  "sources": "Class attributes 'method' and 'priority'; abstract property 'name'; abstract method 'run'.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class serves as a structural framework only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard Python constructs, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured abstract class using dataclasses and ABC, with no external data handling, network activity, or malicious code. It defines a framework for prioritized hooks, with comparison logic based solely on 'priority'. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are present. All signals indicate benign, standard code intended for extension in plugin architectures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its structural, non-malicious nature. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, and obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code's characteristics.",
