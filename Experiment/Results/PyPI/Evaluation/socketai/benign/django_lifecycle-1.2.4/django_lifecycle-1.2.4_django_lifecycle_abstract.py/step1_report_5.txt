{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for hooked methods with prioritization, intended for extension and use in a larger system.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reads; the code defines a class structure and annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up a class structure; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. Usage of abstract methods and dataclass is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a dataclass inheriting from ABC, and declares abstract methods with a comparison operator. No malicious constructs, no external input handling, no network or file operations. It appears to be a straightforward class setup for extension within a larger application. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious code intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structural definition for a base class with abstract methods. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
