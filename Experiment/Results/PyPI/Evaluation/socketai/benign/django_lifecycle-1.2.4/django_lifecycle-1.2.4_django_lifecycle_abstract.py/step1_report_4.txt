  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for hooked methods with ordering based on priority.",
  "sources": "Imports: abc, dataclasses, typing; Class attributes: method, priority",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data processing or external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; standard abstract class definition with no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with properties and methods meant for extension. It uses standard Python modules and patterns. No suspicious imports or functions. No network, file, or environment interactions. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic observed. The class is structured to support prioritized hooks but contains no code that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign abstract class used for organizing hooked methods with priorities. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
