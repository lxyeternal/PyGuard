{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for hooked methods with priority ordering, intended for extension in subclasses.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library modules (abc, dataclasses, typing); class attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; primarily class and method definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The class is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'AbstractHookedMethod' with properties and abstract methods. It uses standard Python features (dataclasses, ABC). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects. No input/output operations or network activities are present. The class is structured for extensibility and ordering based on priority, with no suspicious constructs or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign abstract base class intended for extension. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
