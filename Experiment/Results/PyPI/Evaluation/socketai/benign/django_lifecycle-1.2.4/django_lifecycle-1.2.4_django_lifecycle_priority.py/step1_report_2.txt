  "purpose": "Define priority levels for use in the program",
  "sources": "No data input sources; static variable assignments",
  "sinks": "No sink operations or data leaks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely variable definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant assignments",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple constant assignments of priority levels, which appear to be configuration values. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, or code execution mechanisms. The variables are assigned fixed integer values representing different priority levels. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for priority levels with no malicious intent or security risks.",
