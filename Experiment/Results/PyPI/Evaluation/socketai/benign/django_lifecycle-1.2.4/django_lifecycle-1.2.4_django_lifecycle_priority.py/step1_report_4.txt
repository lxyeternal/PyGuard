  "purpose": "Define priority levels as constants for use in other parts of the program.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow since only constants are defined.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward constant assignments with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns integer values to priority-related variables, likely for use elsewhere in the application. There are no functions, no input/output operations, and no complex logic. The code appears to be a simple configuration or constants setup. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident from these assignments. The simplicity indicates this is a benign piece of code defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constant definitions for priority levels. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It is a straightforward configuration snippet with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
