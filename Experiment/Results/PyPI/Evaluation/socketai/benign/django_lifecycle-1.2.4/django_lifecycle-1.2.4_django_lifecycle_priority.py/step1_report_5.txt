  "purpose": "Define priority levels as constants for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data output present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; simple constant definitions with no side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns integer values to constant variables representing priority levels. There are no input, output, or control flow structures. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The constants could be used elsewhere in an application, but in isolation, they pose no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for priority levels, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
