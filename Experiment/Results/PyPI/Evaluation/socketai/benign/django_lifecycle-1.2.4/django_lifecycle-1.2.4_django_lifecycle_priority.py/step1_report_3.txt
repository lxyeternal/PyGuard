  "purpose": "Define priority levels using constant integer values for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No input sources; these are static constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; these are simple constant assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward constant definitions without unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a set of constants representing different priority levels with assigned integer values. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors. No obfuscated code, malicious intent, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a typical set of constant definitions for use elsewhere in an application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard constant definitions for priority levels, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
