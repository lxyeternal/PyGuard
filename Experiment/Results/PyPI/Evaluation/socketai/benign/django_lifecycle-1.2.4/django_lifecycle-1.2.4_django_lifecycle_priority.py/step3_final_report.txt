  "purpose": "Define priority levels as constants for use in configuration or control flow.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments at the top level of the code.",
  "sinks": "No data input or output; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions assigning fixed integer values to priority level variables. There are no functions, input/output operations, dynamic behaviors, or signs of obfuscation. The code is simple, static, and benign. All reviews correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The scores are consistent with the code's straightforwardness, and no anomalies or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constant definitions for priority levels with no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate and appropriate in their assessments.",
