  "purpose": "Defines priority level constants for use in a larger application or system.",
  "sources": "Constant variable definitions; no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward constant definitions with no complex logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns integer values to variables representing priority levels. These are simple constant definitions with no dynamic execution, user input, or external dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The constants may be used elsewhere in the project for controlling task priorities, but on their own, they are benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward declaration of priority constants with no malicious intent or security risks.",
