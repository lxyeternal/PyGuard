{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or module operations without explicit malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data sources such as environment variables, user input, or external files; potential network or file sinks if present.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to files, network connections, or environment variables; places where untrusted data could lead to leaks or execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs), with no evidence of malicious manipulation or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious functions like eval/exec detected; code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose is benign, involving standard data handling or module operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or credential theft are evident. The confidence in benign assessment is high where code is available. No malicious code or obfuscation detected, and security risk remains low. The absence of suspicious features and the consistency across reports support a benign evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is set to 0. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
