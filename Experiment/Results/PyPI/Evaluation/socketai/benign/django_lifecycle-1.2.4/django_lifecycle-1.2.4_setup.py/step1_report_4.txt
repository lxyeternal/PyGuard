{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup for a Python package called 'django-lifecycle', including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from __init__.py, reads README.md for long description, retrieves version, author, and author_email via get_metadata function, and specifies dependencies in install_requires and tests_require.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code does not process untrusted input directly or execute code dynamically from external sources.",
  "flows": "The data flows from static files (__init__.py and README.md) into variables used in the setup() function, which then configures package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of codecs.open is somewhat outdated but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present. The get_metadata function employs regex to extract metadata, which is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: reading package metadata from files, defining classifiers, and configuring installation parameters. The get_metadata function extracts package info from __init__.py using regex. The readme() function reads the markdown file for long description. The setup() call compiles all metadata and dependencies for packaging. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal, well-structured setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident. The code reads static files and sets package metadata without executing or processing untrusted data.",
