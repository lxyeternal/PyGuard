{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'django-lifecycle' with metadata extraction and package configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading __init__.py for metadata, reading README.md for long description, user-specified dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None that directly process untrusted input; the setup process reads static files and uses predefined strings.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; all data sources are static or file-based.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup procedures with safe practices: reading metadata from a package file, reading a README, and defining dependencies. It does not perform any network operations, execute untrusted code, or handle user input. The code follows typical Python packaging conventions without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging a Django-related Python module. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
