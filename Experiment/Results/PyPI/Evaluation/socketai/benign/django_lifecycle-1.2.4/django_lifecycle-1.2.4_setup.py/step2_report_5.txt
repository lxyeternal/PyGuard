  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reads metadata from `__init__.py`, reads README.md, no external inputs.\n- **Targets & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious code; standard metadata extraction.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses regex for parsing, but this is typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with standard setup script practices.\n- No suspicious behavior or external data processing.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reads metadata from local files, no external input.\n- Uses regex for parsing, but standard.\n- No dynamic code execution or external activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reads static files, no untrusted input.\n- Uses `get_metadata()` with regex, standard practice.\n- No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above, standard setup process.\n- No external or untrusted data, no obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports describe a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of regex for metadata extraction is standard in such scripts, and no external data or network activity is involved.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis is a standard, safe setup script with no security concerns.",
