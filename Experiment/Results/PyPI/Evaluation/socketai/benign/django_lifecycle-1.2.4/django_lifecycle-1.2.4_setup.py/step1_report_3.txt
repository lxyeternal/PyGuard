  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'django-lifecycle' package, including metadata retrieval and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading the __init__.py file for metadata, reading README.md for long description, and static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data is written or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. Metadata is read from files, and static data is used for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or external code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package metadata from a local file, reads a README for long description, and defines setup configuration with static data. All data reads are from trusted local files. No external or untrusted data inputs are processed. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of regular expressions for parsing metadata is standard and does not pose security concerns. The script appears to follow standard Python packaging conventions without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
