{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration and metadata extraction for the 'django-lifecycle' package.",
  "sources": "Reading '__init__.py' for package metadata, reading 'README.md' for long description, importing 'setuptools' for setup process.",
  "targets": "Potential data leaks or malicious code execution could occur if input files or external data sources are manipulated, but none are directly used here.",
  "flows": "Reading package metadata from '__init__.py' to populate setup parameters; reading 'README.md' for description; executing setup with provided metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code structures detected. The regex is used for standard metadata parsing; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package metadata from a local '__init__.py' file, parses it with a regex, and reads a markdown file for description. It then calls 'setuptools.setup' with static and dynamic data. There are no external inputs or untrusted data sources. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities are observed. The code's purpose is to facilitate package setup, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks securely.",
