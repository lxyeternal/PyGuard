{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, responsible for reading package metadata, README content, and configuring package installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads local files: '__init__.py' for metadata, 'README.md' for description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external inputs or network calls.",
  "flows": "Metadata and description data flow from local files into setup configuration; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard regex parsing; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading static files, parsing metadata with regex, and invoking setuptools.setup(). No dynamic code execution, external inputs, or malicious patterns are present. The regex parsing is straightforward, and the code structure is standard. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scoring reflects this. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
