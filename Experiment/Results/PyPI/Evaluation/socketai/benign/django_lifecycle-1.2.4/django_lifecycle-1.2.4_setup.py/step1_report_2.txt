{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'django-lifecycle' package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from '__init__.py', reads README.md for long description, and retrieves version, author, and email from the package's init file.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink where untrusted data is used; the script primarily reads files and uses regex to extract metadata, then passes this data to setuptools for package creation.",
  "flows": "Reads '__init__.py' for metadata -> Reads 'README.md' -> Calls 'setuptools.setup()' with extracted data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to parse metadata; the code is standard for setup scripts with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; no dynamic execution or external network calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup operations: reading metadata from the package's '__init__.py' file, reading the README for long description, and calling 'setuptools.setup()' with package info. The regex used for metadata extraction is straightforward. No untrusted input processing or suspicious code patterns are present. The dependencies listed are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs routine package configuration tasks safely.",
