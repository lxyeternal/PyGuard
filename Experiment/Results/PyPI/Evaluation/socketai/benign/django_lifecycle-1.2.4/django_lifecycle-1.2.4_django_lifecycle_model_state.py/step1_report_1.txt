{
  "purpose": "This code manages and compares the state of Django model instances, tracking changes and retrieving initial values.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the instance.__dict__ attribute, from the instance's related fields via get_value, and from the initial_state dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily accesses instance data and internal dictionaries; there are no evident sinks that lead to data leaks, network communication, or code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the instance.__dict__ and related fields into the initial_state; get_diff compares current state with initial_state; get_value retrieves initial values; has_changed checks for differences based on diffs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling are present. The code relies on external utilities (get_value, sanitize_field_name) but they are assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code safely manages model state by copying instance dictionaries, removing internal attributes, and comparing values to detect changes. No untrusted input handling or external communication occurs. The code utilizes standard Python practices and Django conventions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for tracking Django model state changes with no malicious intent or security issues. It operates within expected parameters without suspicious behavior.",
