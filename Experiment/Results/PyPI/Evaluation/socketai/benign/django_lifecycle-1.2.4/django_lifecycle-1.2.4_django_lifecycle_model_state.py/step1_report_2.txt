{
  "purpose": "The code manages and tracks the state of a Django model instance, detecting changes in fields by comparing current and initial states.",
  "sources": "Reads from instance.__dict__, get_value(), and sanitize_field_name() functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks for untrusted data; no data transmission or system modification points.",
  "flows": "Initial state is captured from instance, then get_diff compares current state with initial, using get_value and sanitize_field_name to process data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of get_value and sanitize_field_name functions might warrant review, but their purpose appears legitimate. No code injection, unsafe SQL, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of model state tracking in Django, with functions to capture initial state, compare current state, and determine if fields have changed. The usage of utility functions for sanitization and value retrieval appears standard and does not suggest malicious intent. No network operations, file modifications, or system commands are present. The code’s structure and dependencies seem typical for a Django project. No anomalies or indicators of malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal, utility-based implementation for tracking Django model state changes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code segment.",
