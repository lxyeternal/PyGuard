{
  "purpose": "The code defines a ModelState class for tracking the state of Django model instances, comparing current and initial values, and detecting changes.",
  "sources": "Reads include instance.__dict__, instance._watched_fk_model_fields(), and get_value() function, which accesses model attributes and related fields.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if get_value() or sanitize_field_name() functions perform unsafe operations; no direct untrusted input sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "ModelState.from_instance() collects initial state; get_diff() compares current to initial; get_value() retrieves sanitized values; has_changed() checks for modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code uses standard Django and typing utilities; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code securely accesses model instance data, sanitizes field names, and compares values to detect changes. No suspicious data flows, external communications, or malicious constructs are evident. The functions are straightforward, relying on external utilities for sanitization and value retrieval, which appear standard. No evidence of malicious intent or malicious code inclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for tracking Django model states with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs normal data handling and comparison operations.",
