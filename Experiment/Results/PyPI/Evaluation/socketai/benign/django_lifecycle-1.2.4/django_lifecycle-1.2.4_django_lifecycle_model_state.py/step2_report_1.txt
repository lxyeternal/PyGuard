  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a class for tracking Django model state, comparing initial and current values.\n- It uses external utility functions (`get_value`, `sanitize_field_name`) which are assumed safe.\n- No network, file, or system modifications are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The logic is straightforward and consistent with typical Django ORM practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in code:\n- The code does not contain any malicious behavior.\n- The functions perform standard data copying, sanitization, and comparison.\n- No evidence of data leaks, code injection, or malware.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The only potential concern could be reliance on external utility functions, but their purpose appears legitimate.\n- No issues with the code's logic or implementation.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is consistent with the code's nature; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly `0` or `0.1`. Given the code's nature, this is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- If any score were higher, I would require evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Consistency and potential discrepancies:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, and their reasoning is sound.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe implementation for Django model state tracking with no security issues or malware concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No adjustments needed.",
