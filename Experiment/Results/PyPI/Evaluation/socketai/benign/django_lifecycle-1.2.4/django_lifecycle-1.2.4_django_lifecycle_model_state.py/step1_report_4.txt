{
  "purpose": "This code defines a ModelState class for tracking and comparing the state of Django models, particularly for lifecycle management.",
  "sources": "get_value and sanitize_field_name functions from django_lifecycle.utils, and instance attributes such as __dict__ and _watched_fk_model_fields()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; data is used internally for state comparison and management",
  "flows": "The code extracts model instance data, cleans it, and compares current and initial states to identify changes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code relies on external utility functions; no suspicious code is present",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a class for tracking model state. It copies instance data, removes specific internal fields, and compares states to identify modifications. All functions perform straightforward data manipulation and comparison without executing external or untrusted code. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard application logic for state management, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for tracking Django model states. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on its logic. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.",
