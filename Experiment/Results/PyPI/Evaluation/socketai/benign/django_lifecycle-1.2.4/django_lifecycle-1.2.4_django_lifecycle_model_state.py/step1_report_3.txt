{
  "purpose": "This code manages the state of a Django model instance for change detection, including capturing initial state, detecting differences, and checking if fields have changed.",
  "sources": "get_value (imported from django_lifecycle.utils), sanitize_field_name (imported from django_lifecycle.utils), instance.__dict__, instance._watched_fk_model_fields()",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "The initial state is captured from an instance, and methods compare current state to initial state for changes. get_value retrieves initial data, sanitize_field_name processes field names.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no external network interactions, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard state management for a Django model, with functions to create initial snapshots, compare current and initial states, and determine if specific fields have changed. It uses imported utility functions for data handling and sanitization. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code structure and logic are typical for change tracking in ORM models.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It responsibly manages model state and change detection without any suspicious or harmful behaviors.",
