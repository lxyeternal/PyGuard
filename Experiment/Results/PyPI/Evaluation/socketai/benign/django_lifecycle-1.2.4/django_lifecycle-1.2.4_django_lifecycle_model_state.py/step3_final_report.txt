  "purpose": "Track and compare the initial and current state of Django model instances to detect changes.",
  "sources": "Instance's __dict__, get_value() utility, sanitize_field_name() utility",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no external communication or system modifications",
  "flows": "Initial state data flows from __dict__ and get_value() to comparison functions; no external data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; reliance on external utility functions is standard and appears safe",
  "analysis": "The code copies model instance data, sanitizes field names, and compares initial and current values to detect changes. It uses standard Django patterns and external utilities assumed safe. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The logic is straightforward, with no network or system modifications. External utility functions are assumed secure; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for tracking Django model state changes. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent and appropriate.",
