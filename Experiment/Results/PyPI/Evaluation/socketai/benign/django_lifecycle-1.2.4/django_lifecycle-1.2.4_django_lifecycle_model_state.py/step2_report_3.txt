  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages and compares Django model states, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious behavior. The logic involves copying dictionaries, removing internal attributes, and comparing values—standard practices. The utility functions `get_value` and `sanitize_field_name` are external but assumed safe, as the report notes.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- **Issues present?** No.  \n- **Scores reasonable?** Yes.  \n- **Malware?** 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Risk?** 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on safe data handling and no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the logic is standard, and no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident. The functions used are typical for Django applications.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- **Issues present?** No.  \n- **Scores reasonable?** Yes.  \n- **Malware?** 0 fits.  \n- **Risk?** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard change detection logic, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports; no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- **Issues present?** No.  \n- **Scores reasonable?** Yes.  \n- **Malware?** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard state management, no malicious behavior, minor securityRisk=0.1 (possibly due to external utility functions).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe slight securityRisk score is acceptable given the reliance on external utilities, which could theoretically introduce issues if unsafe. However, no concrete evidence suggests malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- **Issues present?** No.  \n- **Scores reasonable?** Yes, considering external utility functions.  \n- **Malware?** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no malicious activity, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no suspicious code or behavior. The minor securityRisk score is justified due to reliance on external functions, but no evidence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree the code is standard and safe.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0 in all cases, correct.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, with minor scores (0.1) justified by external dependencies but no direct vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a typical implementation for tracking Django model states, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, due to external utility functions but no concrete vulnerabilities)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
