  "purpose": "Inspect Django models for methods with '_hooked' attribute and ensure inheritance from LifecycleModelMixin.",
  "sources": "Model class definitions, inspect.getmembers for functions, attribute '_hooked', inheritance check from LifecycleModelMixin.",
  "sinks": "Error reporting for models not inheriting from LifecycleModelMixin when hooked methods are present.",
  "flows": "Inspect model methods -> identify '_hooked' attribute -> check inheritance -> yield Error if conditions met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs static introspection and registration of Django checks without executing untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects Django models for methods with a '_hooked' attribute and verifies if they inherit from 'LifecycleModelMixin'. It registers a check to enforce this inheritance. The code uses standard Django patterns, static introspection, and registration during app startup. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. External dependency 'django_lifecycle' is used legitimately. The logic is straightforward, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django model check implementation that inspects models for specific attributes and inheritance, with no malicious or security issues detected. The assigned scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of zero.",
