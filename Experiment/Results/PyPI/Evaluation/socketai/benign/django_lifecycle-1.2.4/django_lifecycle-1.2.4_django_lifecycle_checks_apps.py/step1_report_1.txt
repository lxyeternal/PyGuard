{
  "purpose": "This code defines Django app configuration and checks to ensure models with hooked methods inherit from LifecycleModelMixin, aiding in maintaining model consistency.",
  "sources": "import statements, especially inspect.getmembers, and dynamic model inspection via get_models_to_check",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data; the code mainly inspects model classes and registers checks.",
  "flows": "inspect.getmembers extracts functions from models, which is then used to determine if hooked methods are present; errors are generated based on these inspections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Usage of inspect for model inspection is standard. Import from django_lifecycle is typical for lifecycle management.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically inspects Django models for specific method attributes and inheritance, registering checks to enforce model inheritance rules. All operations involve introspection and error reporting. No data exfiltration, malicious code, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django application check for model inheritance consistency related to lifecycle hooks. It performs model introspection without any malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
