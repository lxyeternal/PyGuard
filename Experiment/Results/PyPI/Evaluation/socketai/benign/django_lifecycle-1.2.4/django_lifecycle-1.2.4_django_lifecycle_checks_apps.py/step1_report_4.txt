{
  "purpose": "The code defines Django application checks to validate that models with hooked methods inherit from a specific lifecycle mixin, ensuring proper design and behavior within the Django app.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Django app configurations, model classes, and method attributes. It inspects model classes and their functions for specific attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into security-critical functions. The only dynamic behavior is registering a check function, which is standard in Django.",
  "flows": "The flow involves inspecting models for specific attributes and inheritance, then generating errors if conditions are not met. No untrusted data flows into vulnerable functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic detected. The code performs standard model inspection and validation routines.",
  "analysis": "The script performs model introspection to enforce coding standards. It checks for specific method attributes and inheritance, and registers a Django check. No obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior is present. It uses typical Django patterns and inspection methods without any suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django app check implementation that enforces correct inheritance for models with hooked methods. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
