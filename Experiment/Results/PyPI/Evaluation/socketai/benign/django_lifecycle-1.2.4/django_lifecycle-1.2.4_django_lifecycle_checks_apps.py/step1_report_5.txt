{
  "purpose": "The code defines Django app configuration and checks related to models, specifically verifying if models with hooked methods inherit from a lifecycle mixin.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django modules, inspection of model attributes, dynamic retrieval of models, and registration of checks.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily performs static analysis and does not contain obvious data sinks that process untrusted data or perform critical security actions.",
  "flows": "Code inspects models for hooked methods, then verifies inheritance; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; registration occurs at app startup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected. The use of inspection and dynamic registration appears standard for Django checks.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects models for functions with a '_hooked' attribute and checks inheritance from a specific mixin. It does not execute untrusted code or perform any network or file operations. The dynamic registration of checks is typical in Django applications. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a custom Django app check system, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django application configuration and model check implementation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on static analysis. It is safe and serves the purpose of enforcing model inheritance policies.",
