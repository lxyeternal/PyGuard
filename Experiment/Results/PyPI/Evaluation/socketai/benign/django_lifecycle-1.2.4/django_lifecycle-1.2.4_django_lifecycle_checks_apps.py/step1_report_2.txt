{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Django application checks to validate that models with hooked methods inherit from a specific lifecycle mixin, and registers this check within Django's app configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads Django app configurations, model classes, and inspect member functions of models. It also imports external modules like django_lifecycle.mixins.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks, command execution, or other malicious effects are present. No untrusted data handling or output operations are detected.",
  "flows": "The code flows from retrieving app models, inspecting their methods for a specific attribute, checking class inheritance, and then registering a check that issues errors if certain conditions are met.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code performs typical Django app check registration and model introspection.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static analysis and registration of a Django app check. It inspects models for specific attributes and inheritance, which is a standard pattern. It imports from external modules but does not execute untrusted code or external network connections. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django application check implementation with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It simply enforces a coding convention and integrates with Django's system. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
