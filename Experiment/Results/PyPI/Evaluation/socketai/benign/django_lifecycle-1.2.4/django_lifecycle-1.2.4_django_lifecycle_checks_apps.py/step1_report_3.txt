{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom checks for Django models to ensure that models with hooked methods inherit from a specific lifecycle mixin, and registers these checks as part of a Django app configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads from Django app configurations, inspects model classes for methods and attributes, imports from django_lifecycle.mixins, and uses Django's registry and error reporting mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "Potentially problematic areas include importing external modules (django_lifecycle), inspecting model methods and attributes, and registering checks with Django's validation framework.",
  "flows": "Code reads app configs -> iterates models -> inspects model methods for '_hooked' attribute -> checks inheritance -> yields errors -> registers check function during app startup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of external library 'django_lifecycle' is standard for model lifecycle management, not suspicious. No obfuscated code or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a Django app config with custom model validation checks. It inspects model classes for specific method attributes and inheritance, then reports errors if models do not follow expected inheritance patterns. The external dependency 'django_lifecycle' is imported within a function, which is a common pattern to avoid circular imports or unnecessary loading. The check registration occurs in the app's ready() method, which is typical. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware indicators is present. The code is straightforward and follows Django conventions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django app configuration implementing model validation checks. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The code is well-structured and legitimate.",
