  "purpose": "Define an abstract Django model class that inherits from a mixin and Django's base model.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django models and a local mixin.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only declares a class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's models and a local mixin, then defines an abstract model class inheriting from both. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external communications. The class is likely intended for reuse in other models. No malicious or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward Django model declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
