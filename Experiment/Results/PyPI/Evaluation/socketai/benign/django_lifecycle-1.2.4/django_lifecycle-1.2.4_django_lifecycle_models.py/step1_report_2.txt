  "purpose": "Define an abstract Django model that extends a custom mixin for lifecycle management.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django models and a local mixin module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Import statements load external code; class definition sets up inheritance but does not execute data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django modules and a custom mixin, then defines an abstract model class inheriting from the mixin and Django's Model. There are no input processing, data handling, or dangerous functions present. The code appears standard for Django model definition without any obfuscated or malicious code. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward Django abstract model setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
