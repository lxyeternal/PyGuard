{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple calculator that tokenizes and parses arithmetic expressions, supporting variable assignment and evaluation.",
  "sources": "User input via the input() function in the main loop; tokens generated by the CalcLexer class.",
  "sinks": "The parsed expressions are evaluated within the script; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input -> Lexer tokenization -> Parser processing -> Evaluation of expressions or variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The only unusual aspect is the use of 'sys.path.insert(0, \"../..\")', which could be unnecessary or potentially problematic if unintended modules are present, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a basic calculator with token definitions and parsing rules, supporting arithmetic and variable storage. It reads user input in an infinite loop, tokenizes it, and evaluates it. No external or network communication, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are evident. The 'sys.path.insert' line might be considered unusual, but it does not pose a security threat. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present. The overall structure is straightforward, designed solely for local expression evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, non-malicious calculator implementation with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as intended for local arithmetic evaluation and variable assignment.",
