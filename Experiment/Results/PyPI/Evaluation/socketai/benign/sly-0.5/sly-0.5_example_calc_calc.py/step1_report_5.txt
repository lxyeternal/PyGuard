{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple calculator with a lexer and parser, allowing variable assignment and arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "User input from the 'input' function, tokenized by CalcLexer.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'parser.parse' on tokenized input, which evaluates expressions and executes print statements.",
  "flows": "User input -> lexer.tokenize -> parser.parse -> evaluation of expressions -> potential print output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external connections, no obfuscated code. No unsafe code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a lexer and parser for basic arithmetic expressions and variable assignment. It reads user input in an infinite loop, tokenizes it, and parses/evaluates it, printing results or updating the variable dictionary. No external network activity, no system modifications, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code does not contain malicious backdoors, malware, or suspicious behavior. It performs straightforward expression evaluation without unsafe eval functions or system commands.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign calculator implementation with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It handles user input securely within its scope and does not perform any harmful actions.",
