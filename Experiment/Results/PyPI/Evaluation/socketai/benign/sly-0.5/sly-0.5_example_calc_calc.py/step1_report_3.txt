{
  "purpose": "A simple calculator implementation using a lexer and parser for arithmetic expressions, with variable assignment and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Input from user via 'input()' function, reading calculation expressions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs evaluation results or error messages via 'print()'. No external data or network sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User input -> lexer tokenization -> parser evaluation -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs straightforward arithmetic parsing and evaluation. No use of eval or system commands. No obfuscated or unusual language features. The only potentially risky aspect is division without zero handling, but this does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a lexer and parser for a basic calculator. It reads user input, tokenizes it, and evaluates expressions. Variables can be assigned and retrieved. The parser supports basic arithmetic and variable management. No external connections, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose appears to be a benign calculator without malicious or maliciously disguised behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward calculator implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or sabotage mechanisms. The overall security risk is very low.",
