{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple calculator language parser and lexer, allowing variable assignment and basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "User input from the 'input' function in the main loop, tokenization from lexer.tokenize()",
  "sinks": "Evaluation of expressions and variable lookups, printing output with print()",
  "flows": "Input from user -> tokenization -> parsing -> evaluation -> output; no external data flows or network activity observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. The code does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or data exfiltration. It uses standard parsing and evaluation procedures. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Lexer class that tokenizes basic arithmetic expressions with variables, and a Parser class that evaluates expressions, supports variable assignment, and handles basic arithmetic operations with correct precedence. The main loop reads user input, tokenizes, and parses it, printing results. No external resource access, network activity, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with no evident malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign calculator interpreter with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard parsing and evaluation tasks without external interactions or potential abuse.",
