{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple calculator with variable assignment, expression evaluation, and basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the user via the 'input' function; data is tokenized by 'CalcLexer'.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally within the 'CalcParser'; no direct data leakage or external output other than print statements. No external network or file sinks.",
  "flows": "User input flows into 'lexer.tokenize', then into 'parser.parse', which processes tokens, performs calculations, and updates 'self.names' for variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'sys.path.insert' to add directories could be unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. The code lacks input validation for malicious input but this is expected in such a simple calculator.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lexer and parser for a calculator with variable assignment. The lexer tokenizes input, including identifiers, numbers, and operators. The parser evaluates expressions and handles variable assignment. The main loop continuously prompts for input, tokenizes, and parses. No network operations, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors are present. No malicious code or backdoors are detected. The use of 'sys.path.insert' might be unusual but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a benign calculator implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward calculator with variable support, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The structure is typical, and no anomalies indicative of malicious intent are present.",
