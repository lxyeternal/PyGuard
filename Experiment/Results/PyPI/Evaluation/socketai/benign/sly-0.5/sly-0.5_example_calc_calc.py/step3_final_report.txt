  "purpose": "A simple calculator supporting variable assignment and arithmetic expressions, using 'sly' lexer and parser.",
  "sources": "User input read via input(), tokenized by CalcLexer, and parsed by CalcParser.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data exfiltration or system modification occurs.",
  "flows": "Input → tokenization → parsing → evaluation → output; no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "The line 'sys.path.insert(0, \"../..\")' is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic calculator with variable assignment, expression evaluation, and user interaction. It does not perform network activity, file access, or dynamic code execution. The only unusual aspect is the sys.path modification, which could be problematic in some environments but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign calculator implementation with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the sys.path modification, which does not constitute malicious activity. The overall security risk is negligible.",
