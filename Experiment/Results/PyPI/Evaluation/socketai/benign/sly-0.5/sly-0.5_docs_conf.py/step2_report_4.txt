  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration file (conf.py).\n- No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network activity is reported.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are identified.\n- The code is static, primarily setting configuration variables for documentation builds.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), and all report scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk are zero.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports only standard modules (sys, os, shlex) and assigns static configuration parameters.\n- No suspicious code patterns, such as eval, exec, dynamic imports, or external data handling.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, nor does it contain any network calls or external dependencies.\n- All the reports are consistent in their assessment: benign, standard configuration, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Score evaluation:**\n- Malware score: 0 in all reports. This aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- Obfuscated score: 0. All reports agree the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- Risk score: 0 or very close to it. Given the static nature and lack of external interactions, this is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n- I would assign the following scores:\n  - Malware: **0**\n  - Obfuscated: **0**\n  - Risk: **0**\n\nThese reflect the benign, static, and well-understood nature of the script.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are thorough and accurate, and the scoring aligns with the analysis.",
