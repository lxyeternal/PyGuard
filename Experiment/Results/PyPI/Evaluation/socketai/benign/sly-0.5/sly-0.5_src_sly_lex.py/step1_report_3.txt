{
  "purpose": "The code defines a flexible and extensible lexer framework for tokenizing input text, allowing custom token definitions, rules, and states.",
  "sources": "User-defined token patterns, class attributes (tokens, literals, ignore), function decorators, and pattern compilation.",
  "sinks": "Token processing functions, pattern compilation, and error handling may process untrusted input, but primarily for tokenization, not data leakage or external actions.",
  "flows": "Input text -> regex match via compiled patterns -> token objects -> optional user-defined token functions -> error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network calls are present. Usage of standard regex compilation and tokenization patterns appears normal. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a lexer class with support for rule collection, pattern compilation, state management, and tokenization. It uses standard Python modules (re) and custom exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The pattern compilation and token matching are straightforward. The code does not perform any network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are observed. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate lexer framework intended for safe token parsing, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured lexer implementation with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is designed for parsing tokens from input text and managing lexer states safely. No security risks or malware signals are present based on the provided code.",
