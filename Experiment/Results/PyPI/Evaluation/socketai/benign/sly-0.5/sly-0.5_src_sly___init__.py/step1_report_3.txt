{
  "purpose": "To import all symbols from local lex and yacc modules and define package version and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .lex and .yacc modules",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; just module import and assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of star imports (*) can obscure the actual imported symbols, but this is common in package initialization files and not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from two local modules, lex and yacc, and sets a version string along with the __all__ attribute to specify exported symbols. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or code execution. The use of star imports, while potentially risky for clarity, is not suspicious in this context and is typical for package __init__.py files. Overall, the code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of setting up the package's namespace.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization script that imports symbols from local modules and sets metadata. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
