{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports all symbols from 'lex' and 'yacc' submodules, sets a version, and exports all symbols from these submodules.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'lex' and 'yacc' modules, specifically the __all__ attribute in both modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission observed",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks; imports are static and do not involve untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "Use of star imports ('*') which can hide malicious code in the imported modules, but this is a common pattern in plugin-like modules; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from 'lex' and 'yacc' modules and aggregates their '__all__' attributes for export. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. The star imports may pose maintainability concerns but are not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of backdoors, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior within this snippet. The code appears to be a simple module setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module that consolidates exports from 'lex' and 'yacc' modules. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in this code fragment. It is a benign, typical pattern for modular Python packages.",
