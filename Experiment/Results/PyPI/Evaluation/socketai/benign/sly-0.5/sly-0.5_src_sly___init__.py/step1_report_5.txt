  "purpose": "To re-export all contents from the 'lex' and 'yacc' modules and define the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'lex' and 'yacc', and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; only internal module imports and attribute definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Simple re-export pattern; no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from local modules 'lex' and 'yacc', then defines a version string and exports all symbols from these modules via __all__. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The code appears to serve as a module initializer or aggregator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module re-export and version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
