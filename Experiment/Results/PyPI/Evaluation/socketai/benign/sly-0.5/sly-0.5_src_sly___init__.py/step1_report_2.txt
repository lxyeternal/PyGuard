{
  "purpose": "This code imports all symbols from 'lex' and 'yacc' modules and defines the package version and exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'lex' and 'yacc' modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily module import and symbol export.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be risky but is common in parser generator modules; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and defines the '__all__' list to export symbols from 'lex' and 'yacc' modules. It uses 'import *' which can be risky if the imported modules contain malicious or unexpected symbols, but this is standard in parser tools. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. There are no input sources or data flows that could be exploited. The code's simplicity and standard pattern do not suggest malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initialization file importing symbols from 'lex' and 'yacc' modules. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, though the use of 'import *' is generally discouraged for clarity and safety but does not constitute malicious intent here.",
