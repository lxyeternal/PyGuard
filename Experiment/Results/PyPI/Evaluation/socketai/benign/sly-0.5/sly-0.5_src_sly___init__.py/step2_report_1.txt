  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code imports from 'lex' and 'yacc'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or sensitive data handling; static imports.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies observed; straightforward import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 — justified.  \n- obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; imports from 'lex' and 'yacc'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external calls.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of 'import *' is noted as risky but common in parser modules.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Reasonable; no malicious intent, just standard pattern with some caution about 'import *'.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- securityRisk: 0.1 — perhaps slightly high, but considering the use of 'import *', a small risk score is acceptable.  \n- confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; local modules and version string.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data involved.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of star imports noted but common in package init files.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; standard pattern.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 — justified.  \n- obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- securityRisk: 0 — appropriate, given no suspicious activity.  \n- confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; consolidates exports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of star imports; potential maintainability concern but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 — justified.  \n- obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; re-export pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Simple pattern, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 — justified.  \n- obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is a standard package initializer importing all symbols from 'lex' and 'yacc' modules, setting version info, and defining `__all__`.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- **Security Risks:** The only minor concern is the use of 'import *', which is a common pattern in parser modules but can obscure imported symbols. However, this does not pose a security threat here.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security threat present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, standard boilerplate for a Python package, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with minor caution about 'import *' but nothing concerning.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further detailed analysis or specific focus on any aspect.",
