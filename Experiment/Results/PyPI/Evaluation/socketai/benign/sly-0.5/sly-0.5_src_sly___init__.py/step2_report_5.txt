  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a simple Python module that imports all symbols from `lex` and `yacc` modules, sets a version string, and defines `__all__` to control exports.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward and boilerplate, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The use of `import *` is common in parser generator modules, especially in `__init__.py` files, despite being discouraged for clarity and maintainability.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks is found in the code snippets or the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n  The reports acknowledge that `import *` can be risky but are standard in this context. No logical errors are apparent.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n\n  - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n  - **Malware:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n  - **Security risk:** All assign 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the context.\n  - **Confidence:** High (1 or 0.9), reflecting the clarity of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n\n- Since there's no malicious activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious code, **risk scores should remain very low or zero**.\n- The use of `import *` does not inherently pose a security threat here, especially in a controlled package context.\n\n### Malware and obfuscation scores:\n\n- Both are correctly set to 0, as there's no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the code and reports, **the overall risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should be zero**.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code, the absence of suspicious activity, and the standard pattern used in package initialization.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | 0               |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and I agree with them.",
