  "purpose": "Import all symbols from local 'lex' and 'yacc' modules, set version, and define __all__ for exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.lex' and '.yacc' modules, and version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or untrusted input handling; static imports only.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ assignment; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' is noted but common in parser modules; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initializer importing symbols from local modules, setting version info, and defining exports. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of 'import *' is typical in such contexts, though generally discouraged for clarity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with minimal security risk scores (0 or 0.1) justified by the pattern. No anomalies or malicious indicators are found, and the code's simplicity confirms its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
