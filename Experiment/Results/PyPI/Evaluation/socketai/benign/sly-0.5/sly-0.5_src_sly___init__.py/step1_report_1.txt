{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from 'lex' and 'yacc' modules and defines a version and an all-inclusive export list for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the modules 'lex' and 'yacc' imported at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data handling, no external network calls, or sensitive data access are evident.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing all exported elements from 'lex' and 'yacc' modules, then setting version and __all__ variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; straightforward import and export statements with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports all contents from two modules and sets metadata variables. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity. The import statements do not perform any dynamic or malicious operations. No obfuscation or hidden code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package boilerplate for a Python project, importing components and setting metadata. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident.",
