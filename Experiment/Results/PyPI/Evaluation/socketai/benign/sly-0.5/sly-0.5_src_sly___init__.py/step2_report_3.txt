  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n```python\nfrom .lex import *\nfrom .yacc import *\n\n__version__ = \"0.5\"\n__all__ = [ *lex.__all__, *yacc.__all__ ]\n```\n\nThis code is a typical package initialization pattern, importing all symbols from local modules `lex` and `yacc`, setting a version string, and defining `__all__` to specify exported symbols.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code itself is straightforward, with no evident malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The use of `import *` is common in parser generator modules, especially in `__init__.py` files.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Use of `import *`:**  \n  While discouraged in general due to namespace pollution, it is a common pattern in package initialization files. No malicious intent or security flaw arises from this.\n\n- **No dynamic code execution or external data handling:**  \n  The code only imports and sets variables; no suspicious operations are present.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports mention the use of `import *` as a risk, but correctly note that in this context, it's standard and not malicious.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious activity based on assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of the reports:\n\n- **Report 1:**  \n  - **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code as standard boilerplate.  \n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n  - **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n- **Report 2:**  \n  - **Purpose:** Correctly notes the use of `import *` and the potential risk but states it's common in parser modules.  \n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — acceptable, given the cautious approach.  \n  - **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n- **Report 3:**  \n  - Similar to above, accurate in identifying the pattern as standard.  \n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n  - **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n- **Report 4:**  \n  - Correctly states the pattern is typical and benign.  \n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n  - **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n- **Report 5:**  \n  - Same as above, accurate assessment.  \n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n  - **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct given the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in one report (0.1), which is acceptable due to the use of `import *`. Otherwise, 0 is fine.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The use of `import *` is typical in such modules and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for `import *`, but it's standard in this context)\n\nThe scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is benign, standard package boilerplate, with no security issues. The slight risk score reflects the use of `import *`, which is acceptable here. No changes are necessary to the scores or reasoning.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the nature of the code.",
