{
  "purpose": "Defines a metaclass for processing class docstrings through a lexer and parser to dynamically modify class attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads the class's __doc__, __qualname__, and __module__ attributes; calls lexer.tokenize() and parser.parse() with the docstring content.",
  "sinks": "Update of class dictionary with parsed data; no direct data sinks or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Class __doc__ -> lexer.tokenize() -> parser.parse() -> parsedict -> class dict update",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected; standard usage of lexer/parser pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a metaclass that processes class docstrings via user-supplied lexer and parser classes, integrating the parsed dictionary into the class at creation time. It dynamically assigns class attributes based on the parsed output. No data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscation patterns are present. The only potential concern is the reliance on external lexer/parser classes, which, if malicious or compromised, could introduce risks, but within this code snippet, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a docstring parsing mechanism using custom lexer/parser classes. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is detected. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
