  "purpose": "Define a metaclass that processes class docstrings through a lexer and parser to embed parsed data into class definitions.",
  "sources": "Class docstring (__doc__) attribute",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no direct data leaks or untrusted data processing identified",
  "flows": "Docstring -> Lexer tokenization -> Parser -> Parsed dictionary -> Class dict update",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of dynamic class modification is standard for metaclasses, not suspicious here.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass that processes class docstrings with an external lexer and parser to augment class attributes. It involves creating lexer and parser instances, tokenizing the docstring, and updating class dictionaries with the parsed results. The process appears to be a legitimate pattern for meta-programming and documentation processing. No external data is fetched or transmitted, and there are no suspicious functions or code patterns. The design relies on user-defined lexers and parsers, which are not part of this code, but that is a controlled pattern. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or system interference.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a metaclass for processing class docstrings with external parsers. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
