{
  "purpose": "The code implements a mini-language parser and compiler for encoding functions and expressions into WebAssembly (Wasm).",
  "sources": "Input source code read from a file specified as a command-line argument, tokenized by the Lexer.",
  "sinks": "Generated WebAssembly module code via the wasm.Module() API, and file output of the compiled Wasm and HTML files.",
  "flows": "Input file read → tokenized by Lexer → parsed by Parser → functions and expressions compiled into wasm.Module → written to output files.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a mini-language compiler without obfuscated constructs or hidden code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is primarily focused on translation, with no network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lexer and parser for a small expression language targeting WebAssembly. It processes input files to define functions, parse expressions, and compile them into a wasm.Module object. The parser methods translate language constructs into wasm instructions. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's structure and functions are typical of a language compiler. The only potential concern is the output of compiled files, but no malicious content or backdoors are embedded within the code itself. The code does not perform any operations that could be considered malicious or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a benign mini-language compiler targeting WebAssembly, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a standard implementation without obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
