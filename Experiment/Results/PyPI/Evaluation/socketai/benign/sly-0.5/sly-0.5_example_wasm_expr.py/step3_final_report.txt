{
  "purpose": "A mini-language compiler translating function definitions and expressions into WebAssembly (Wasm), supporting integers and control flow.",
  "sources": "Input file containing function definitions and expressions, tokenized by the lexer.",
  "sinks": "Generated WebAssembly module; no untrusted data sinks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Input data -> tokenization -> parsing -> function and expression processing -> WebAssembly code generation.",
  "anomalies": "Many parser methods contain 'pass' statements, indicating incomplete implementation; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a proof-of-concept mini-language compiler for WebAssembly, supporting basic arithmetic, conditionals, and recursion. It reads input, tokenizes, parses, and generates wasm modules. No evidence of malicious activity, network operations, or obfuscation. The incomplete parser functions suggest an unfinished prototype, which reduces the risk but does not introduce malicious behavior. The absence of hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or external data leaks indicates a benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's current state and content.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, experimental mini-language compiler for WebAssembly with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk score is justified given its incomplete implementation and lack of malicious features.",
