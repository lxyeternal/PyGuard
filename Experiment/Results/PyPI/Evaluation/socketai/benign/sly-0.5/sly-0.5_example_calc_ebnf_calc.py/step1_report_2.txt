  "purpose": "Implement a simple calculator that parses and evaluates expressions, with variable assignment and retrieval.",
  "sources": "User input received via the input() function, tokenized by the lexer.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation of expressions, print statements, and variable assignments.",
  "flows": "Input data → tokenization → parsing → evaluation → output via print.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network activity, and no obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward with standard parsing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lexer and parser for basic arithmetic expressions with variable support. Input is read directly from the user via input(), tokenized, parsed, and evaluated. The 'names' dictionary stores variable assignments. The code handles basic arithmetic operations, variable assignments, and retrievals. No external network access, no code injection, and no suspicious behaviors are present. Error handling is minimal but standard for such a script. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks. The code is transparent and serves a basic calculator function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward calculator implementation with variable support. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The overall security risk is minimal, and there are no indicators of malware or obfuscation.",
