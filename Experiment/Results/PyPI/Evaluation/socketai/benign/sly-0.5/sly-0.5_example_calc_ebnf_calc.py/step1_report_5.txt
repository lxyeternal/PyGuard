{
  "purpose": "The code implements a calculator that tokenizes, parses, and evaluates simple arithmetic expressions, with support for variable assignment and usage.",
  "sources": "User input received via the 'input' function; tokens generated by CalcLexer from user input.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation of expressions that may involve user-defined variables; potential output via print statements.",
  "flows": "User input -> Lexer tokenization -> Parser processing -> Evaluation -> Output via print.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code. The code includes basic arithmetic parsing, which appears benign. Exception handling for undefined names only results in a printed message and default zero, no malicious side effects.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines a Lexer and Parser for a simple calculator language. User input is read in an infinite loop, tokenized, parsed, and the resulting expressions are evaluated and printed. Variable assignments are stored in an internal dictionary. The code does not perform any network operations, file access, or system modifications. The error handling is limited to printing messages. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a basic calculator with variable support. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. There are no indicators of malware or malicious intent. The code appears safe for use.",
