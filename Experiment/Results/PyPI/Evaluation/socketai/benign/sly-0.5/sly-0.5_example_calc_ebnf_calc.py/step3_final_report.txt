  "purpose": "A simple calculator supporting variable assignment and expression evaluation.",
  "sources": "User input via input(), tokenization of input string, reading variable names and numbers.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting evaluation results; variable storage in self.names.",
  "flows": "Input read -> tokenization -> parsing -> variable lookup or assignment -> evaluation -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path.insert(0, '../..') is benign; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward calculator with variable assignment, expression parsing, and evaluation. It uses standard libraries and techniques, with no network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The only minor point is the sys.path modification, which is benign in this context. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code is transparent and well-structured, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent calculator with variable support, free of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
