{
  "purpose": "A simple calculator interpreter that tokenizes and parses arithmetic expressions with variable assignment and evaluation.",
  "sources": "User input from the 'input' function; tokenization from 'lexer.tokenize(text)'",
  "sinks": "The 'parser.parse' method which processes the tokenized input and executes code, such as printing results and updating 'self.names'",
  "flows": "Input -> Tokenization -> Parsing -> Evaluation -> Output (print or variable assignment)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Use of dynamic evaluation is limited to arithmetic parsing. No obfuscated code or external code execution. No data exfiltration or external connections.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward calculator with lexical analysis and parsing. It reads user input and processes arithmetic expressions, supporting variables and basic operations. No network calls, file I/O, or system modifications are present. No suspicious code patterns, such as code injection, remote command execution, or data leaks, are evident. The variable storage is in memory only. Error handling is minimal but does not introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign calculator implementation with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely parses and evaluates user expressions locally without external dependencies that could be exploited.",
