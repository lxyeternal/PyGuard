{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple calculator with a lexer and parser for evaluating basic arithmetic expressions, including variable assignments.",
  "sources": "User input received via 'input()' function in the main loop.",
  "sinks": "Parsing functions process input data; the 'print' statements output evaluation results and error messages.",
  "flows": "User input → Lexer tokenization → Parser processing → Evaluation or error handling → Output via print",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious backdoors, or hidden network activity. Use of 'sys.path.insert' is benign in this context, intended to modify import paths. No code injection or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a lexer and parser for a calculator language, allowing variable assignments and expression evaluation. It reads user input and parses commands accordingly, printing results or error messages. No external or untrusted data sources, network activity, or code execution beyond standard input/output is involved. The use of 'sys.path.insert' is a benign attempt to modify module search paths. There are no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a calculator interpreter with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic parsing and evaluation without external communications or harmful operations.",
