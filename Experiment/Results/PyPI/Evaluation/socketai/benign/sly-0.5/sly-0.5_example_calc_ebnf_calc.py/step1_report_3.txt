  "purpose": "A simple calculator program that tokenizes and parses arithmetic expressions, with support for variables and basic operations.",
  "sources": "Input from user via input() function, tokenized by CalcLexer.tokenize()",
  "targets": "Output from print statements, variable storage in self.names",
  "flows": "User input -> lexer.tokenize() -> parser.parse() -> calculation results or variable assignment -> printed to console",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors or malicious code present. The code performs straightforward parsing and evaluation without external data access.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a basic calculator with variable assignment support. It uses standard library features and a third-party lexer/parser library (sly). No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system modifications is evident. No suspicious or hidden code structures. The code's logic is transparent, and its operations are typical of a calculator application. It handles user input securely within the scope of local evaluation. No hardcoded secrets, no unsafe code injection, and no apparent supply chain attack vectors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward calculator implementation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It processes user input locally without external interactions. Overall, the code appears benign.",
