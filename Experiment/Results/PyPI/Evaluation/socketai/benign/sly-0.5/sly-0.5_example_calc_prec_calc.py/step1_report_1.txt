{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple calculator that tokenizes and parses mathematical expressions, supporting variable assignment and basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from the user via the 'input' function; tokens are generated from user input through 'lexer.tokenize'.",
  "sinks": "The parsed expressions are evaluated within the code, with no external output other than printed results. There are no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "User input flows into the tokenizer, which produces tokens; tokens flow into the parser, which evaluates expressions. Variable assignments update the 'names' dictionary; variable retrieval can access stored values.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs are present. It performs straightforward parsing and evaluation. Error handling is minimal but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs tokenization and parsing of arithmetic expressions with variable support. It uses the sly library for lexing and parsing. No external network or file operations are present. There are no suspicious functions or code flows that suggest malicious activity. Input is read directly from the user, and results are printed locally. No untrusted data is sent externally or stored insecurely. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. Overall, the code appears benign, functioning solely as a local calculator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, local calculator implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any external communications, data leaks, or hidden operations. The overall security risk is minimal.",
