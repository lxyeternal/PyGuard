  "purpose": "This code implements a simple calculator with variable assignment and expression evaluation.",
  "sources": "User input from the input() function, tokenized by CalcLexer.",
  "targets": "Evaluation of expressions, printing results, and updating the 'names' dictionary.",
  "flows": "User input -> lexer.tokenize() -> parser.parse() -> evaluate expressions, possibly update or access 'names' -> output results or error messages.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path.insert(0, \"../..\") potentially to import modules from higher directory, which could be abused to override standard modules. No explicit validation or sanitization of user input beyond tokenization. No network or file operations observed. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, modifies sys.path (which can be risky if malicious modules exist in parent directories), and then implements a straightforward calculator parser with variable support. User input is directly tokenized and parsed without sanitization, but since this is a calculator, it doesn't execute external code or commands. The evaluation relies solely on safe arithmetic and variable lookups within a controlled environment. No malicious data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors are present. The only potential concern is sys.path modification, which could be exploited to import malicious modules if the environment is compromised, but this is a standard practice in some contexts and not inherently malicious here.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple calculator with variable storage, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The sys.path modification is a minor concern but not malicious by itself. Overall, the code appears benign and safe for use.",
