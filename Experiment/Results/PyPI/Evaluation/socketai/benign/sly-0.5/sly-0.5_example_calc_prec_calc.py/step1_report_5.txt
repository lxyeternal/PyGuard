{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple calculator that tokenizes and parses arithmetic expressions, supporting variable assignment and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Input from the user via the input() function, which reads arbitrary text entered in the terminal.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation of expressions, printing output with print(), and storing variables in a local dictionary. No external network connections or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "User input -> Lexer tokenization -> Parser processing -> Evaluation or variable assignment -> Output via print()",
  "anomalies": "None observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No obfuscated code, external network access, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads user input directly, tokenizes it, and evaluates arithmetic expressions. It stores variables in a local dictionary, handles basic arithmetic, and provides output. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network activity, file manipulation, or hidden code. The code structure is straightforward, with no indications of obfuscation or malicious intent. It performs typical calculator functions with proper handling of undefined variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign calculator implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious features. Its functionality is limited to arithmetic computation and variable storage, with no external interactions.",
