  "purpose": "A simple calculator that parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions with variable assignment.",
  "sources": "User input via the input() function; tokens generated by the CalcLexer from user-provided expressions.",
  "sinks": "The print() statements for errors and output; potential exposure of variable values if printed or logged elsewhere.",
  "flows": "User input -> Lexer tokenization -> Parser processing -> Evaluation and print output",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path.insert to modify module search path; no sanitization or validation of user input; no network activity or system modifications; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic arithmetic parser with variable assignment. It reads user input directly from the console, tokenizes it, and evaluates expressions, printing results or errors. No external data sources or network connections are present. The sys.path modification at startup could be used to include malicious modules if the environment is compromised, but within this code, it simply adjusts the module search path. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code does not execute untrusted data beyond parsing and evaluation, and it does not contain obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward calculator with no evident malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It operates solely on user input, with no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. The only minor concern is the sys.path modification, which is a common practice for customizing module paths but could be exploited in a compromised environment. Overall, it appears safe.",
