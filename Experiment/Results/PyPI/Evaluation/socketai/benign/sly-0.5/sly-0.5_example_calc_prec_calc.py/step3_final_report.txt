  "purpose": "A simple calculator supporting variable assignment and expression evaluation.",
  "sources": "User input via input(), tokenization with lexer, variable name lookups.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation results printed to stdout, variable storage in self.names.",
  "flows": "Input -> tokenize -> parse -> evaluate -> print/output.",
  "anomalies": "Minor sys.path modification at startup; no malicious code, obfuscation, or external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward calculator using sly for lexing and parsing. It supports variable assignment and expression evaluation. No network, file, or system modifications are present beyond sys.path insertion, which is a common practice but could be exploited if the environment is compromised. The code does not contain obfuscated patterns or malicious behaviors. All functions and flows are standard and benign. The security implications of sys.path modification are minimal in this context but should be noted as a potential vector in untrusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple calculator with no malicious intent or behavior. The minor sys.path modification is a standard practice and not malicious but could be exploited in a compromised environment. Overall, the code poses negligible security risks.",
