  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing their claims with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code constructs WebAssembly modules via high-level functions and classes.\n- **Sinks:** Correctly notes the code writes binary `.wasm` files and generates HTML/JS for browser execution.\n- **Flows:** Accurately describes data flow from function calls into encoding functions, then into output files.\n- **Anomalies:** Finds no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code—consistent with the code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies the code as a benign, standard WebAssembly builder. No malicious indicators.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is well-founded. No issues found.  \n**Score adjustments:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (minor, due to experimental nature but not malicious).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; no external untrusted input, internal data handling.\n- **Sinks:** No network or system commands; only file outputs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; straightforward code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the code as a legitimate wasm builder with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.  \n**Score adjustments:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code constructs modules from defined functions, globals, etc.\n- **Sinks:** Files are generated for local execution; no network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** The embedded HTML/JS template could execute arbitrary JS, but this is standard for wasm web deployment.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical wasm builder, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No malware or malicious intent.  \n**Score adjustments:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (due to dynamic JS, but this is normal).\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a wasm builder with internal data flow.\n- **Sinks:** Files written are standard; no external commands.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions the \"experimental\" disclaimer, but this is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate wasm generator, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.  \n**Score adjustments:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; internal data handling.\n- **Sinks:** Files generated are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; comments about \"experimental\" are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly a safe wasm builder.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious signs.  \n**Score adjustments:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low).\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently find no malware or malicious activity. The code is a standard wasm module generator.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation or hidden code patterns are detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero mainly due to the \"experimental\" disclaimer and the nature of code generation, but overall very low.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to the experimental disclaimer, but not significant.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured WebAssembly module builder with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk score reflects its experimental nature but does not indicate any security threat.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.
