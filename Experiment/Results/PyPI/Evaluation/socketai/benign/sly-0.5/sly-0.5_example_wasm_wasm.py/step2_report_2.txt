  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states the code is a framework for building WebAssembly modules, with sources being function calls and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Encodes data into binary files and generates HTML/JS for web execution. No external network or sensitive data involved.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard encoding and module construction.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, straightforward wasm builder. No malware, backdoors, or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low, due to the experimental nature).\n\n**Assessment:** This is a benign, well-structured codebase with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with no external input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Writes wasm and HTML files, no external communication or code injection.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation. The code is a standard wasm builder.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign, safe for use.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with external imports and generated code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Generates binary wasm and HTML with embedded JS. The HTML loads and executes wasm.\n- **Anomalies:** The embedded JS fetches and instantiates wasm modules, which is standard. No malicious code, backdoors, or secret data.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical wasm builder with JS glue code. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher due to embedded JS but still benign).\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, standard behavior for wasm modules with web integration.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Programmatic wasm builder, with internal data generation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Encodes sections, writes wasm and html files, no external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. The \"experimental\" disclaimer is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; it's a legitimate wasm generator.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Completely safe, standard code generator.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with internal data and module configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Generates wasm and html files; no external untrusted data at runtime.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; comments about being \"experimental\" are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; safe wasm builder.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, benign code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports indicate a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's functionality—it's a wasm builder, not executing or fetching malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are straightforward, with no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to the experimental/disclaimer notes, but overall very low.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Minimal, mostly due to the experimental disclaimer and embedded JS, but nothing malicious.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a legitimate, open-source-like wasm module builder. It encodes modules, instructions, and generates files for local or web use without any signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores are appropriate, and there is no evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation:** No security concerns; the code can be considered safe for use and distribution.",
