{
  "purpose": "The code constructs WebAssembly modules via high-level classes and functions, encoding instructions, types, and sections for wasm binary and HTML/JS output.",
  "sources": "Function calls, parameters, and internal data structures used for encoding module components.",
  "sinks": "Writes .wasm binary files and generates HTML/JS files for browser execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function calls and data encoding functions into binary sections and output files.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard encoding practices used.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured wasm module builder. It encodes functions, globals, sections, and instructions, and generates files for local or web use. No external network activity, no embedded malicious code, and no signs of sabotage or obfuscation are present. The embedded JS for loading wasm modules is standard for web deployment. The code's design and comments suggest an experimental or educational purpose, but nothing malicious or security-compromising.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate WebAssembly module generator with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. Its low security risk score reflects its benign nature.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
