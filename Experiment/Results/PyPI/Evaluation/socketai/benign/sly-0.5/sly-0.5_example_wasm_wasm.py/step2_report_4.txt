  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a framework for building and encoding WebAssembly modules. Inputs are function calls, parameters, initializers—standard for such a builder.\n- **Sinks:** Generates .wasm and .html files; no external network or system commands involved.\n- **Flows:** Data flows internally from function calls to encoded sections and then to output files.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a legitimate, transparent wasm builder. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It uses standard encoding practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe, with minimal security risk (0.2). Malware score: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The high confidence (0.95) aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, a wasm builder, no external input sources.\n- **Sinks:** Writes files; no network or external command execution.\n- **Flows:** Data flows from function definitions into files; no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation; standard code.\n- **Analysis:** Clear, standard wasm module creation. No malicious side effects.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with a very high confidence (1). Malware: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Builds wasm modules, including JS/HTML generation with embedded fetch and instantiate code.\n- **Sinks:** Files (wasm and html); the HTML contains JS that fetches and runs wasm modules.\n- **Flows:** Data from module definitions to output files; embedded JS code in HTML loads wasm.\n- **Anomalies:** The embedded JavaScript could, in theory, be misused, but it’s standard for wasm loading in browsers.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a typical wasm builder with an HTML template that loads wasm modules. No malicious code, no external data exfiltration, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just standard wasm loading code. Security risk is minimal (~0.2). Malware score: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity; the embedded JS is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar wasm builder, with functions for encoding sections, instructions, and module components.\n- **Sinks:** Files written are wasm and html; no external commands or network activity.\n- **Flows:** Data flows internally; no external untrusted data processed at runtime.\n- **Anomalies:** The comment about \"use at your own peril\" is a standard disclaimer, not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, standard wasm builder code. No signs of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate wasm builder. Security risk is very low (~0.1). Malware: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; safe to use.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Builds wasm modules, generates wasm and html files.\n- **Sinks:** Files are generated; no network or external command execution.\n- **Flows:** Data from function definitions to output files; no external untrusted data processed.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation. The code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis:** Standard wasm module generator, with no malicious behaviors or hidden code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with a high confidence (0.95). Malware: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above 0 (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the embedded JS and HTML, but these are standard for wasm web loading.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. The code is a legitimate wasm builder.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk:** Very low; primarily due to the embedded HTML/JS, which is standard and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### My final estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear and well-structured)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, mostly due to the embedded JS that loads wasm modules—standard practice)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a safe, standard, and legitimate WebAssembly module builder with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
