  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code functionality, potential security issues, obfuscation, malware, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code provides helper functions and a wrapper class for parsing user agent strings, with lazy initialization and optional dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evident data leaks or malicious sinks; data flows are standard for a parser.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Dynamic import checks are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears benign, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscation 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns well with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dynamic dependency detection and thread safety.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious sinks; standard data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of dynamic module detection is common, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Again, the code appears legitimate, with malware score 0, obfuscation 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring seems appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on lazy initialization and optional modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious sinks; standard parsing flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Lazy singleton pattern and dynamic imports are standard; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious activity, malware score 0, obfuscation 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with emphasis on flexible backend selection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious sinks; data flow is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of dynamic import checks and lazy singleton pattern are typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior detected, malware 0, obfuscation 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reiterates standard design: lazy initialization, optional dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risks evident; scores seem correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern—mainly due to dynamic import and lazy initialization patterns, which are standard and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores are consistent and justified across all reports.**  \n- **No adjustments needed.**  \n- **My personal estimate:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard patterns)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for user agent parsing, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
