  "purpose": "Provides helper functions and a wrapper class for parsing user agent strings with lazy initialization and optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input: user agent string passed to parsing functions; Data: optional modules detected via importlib.util.find_spec.",
  "sinks": "Parsed data returned by functions; no untrusted data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input user agent string flows through parser methods to produce parsed results; optional modules influence resolver selection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Use of dynamic import checks and lazy singleton pattern are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Parser class with lazy initialization protected by threading lock, dynamically detects optional dependencies (re2, ua_parser_rs), and sets a default resolver accordingly. Helper functions access a global parser instance, initializing it on first use. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure employs common patterns for optional dependencies and thread safety, with no obfuscation or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for user agent parsing, employing standard patterns for optional dependencies and lazy initialization. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present.",
