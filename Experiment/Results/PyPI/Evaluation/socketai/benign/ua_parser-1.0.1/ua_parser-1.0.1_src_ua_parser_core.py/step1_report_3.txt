{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures, enumerations, and protocols for user agent parsing and resolution, intended for use in identifying browser, OS, and device information from user agent strings.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading operations are present in the code; it only defines classes, enums, and protocols.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling, network operations, or system modifications are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs to sensitive sinks are observed; the code strictly defines data models and interfaces without executing external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be well-structured, with no signs of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and protocol definitions, data classes, and enums related to user agent parsing. It does not perform any data input/output, network communication, or system modification. There are no code injection points, no dynamic execution, and no hardcoded credentials. The overall design is consistent with a standard, non-malicious SDK or library for user agent parsing. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured set of data models and interfaces for user agent parsing, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate part of a user agent parsing library, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
