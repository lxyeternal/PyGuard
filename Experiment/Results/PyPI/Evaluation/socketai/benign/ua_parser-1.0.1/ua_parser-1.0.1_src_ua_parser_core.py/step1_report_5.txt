  "purpose": "Define data structures and protocols for parsing and representing user agent, OS, device, and resolution results in a user agent parsing library.",
  "sources": "No external input reading; primarily data class initializations and property methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or execution functions present.",
  "flows": "No flow from external untrusted data sources to sinks; code consists mainly of data structure definitions and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines immutable data classes for UserAgent, OS, Device, Result, PartialResult, and DefaultedResult, along with enumerations and protocols for resolution and matching. All initializations are straightforward and involve no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, nor any suspicious patterns. The class methods are standard, and property definitions do not involve code injection or unsafe operations. The use of __slots__ and frozen dataclasses indicates a focus on efficiency and immutability. No potential malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this source.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of data classes and protocols for a user agent parsing library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a safe, typical implementation for defining data structures and interfaces without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
