{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures, enums, and protocols for parsing user agent strings, including UserAgent, OS, Device, and related classes, without external data input or network activity.",
  "sources": "No external input reading; data is defined within the code as class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; the code only sets attributes internally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data classes and protocols for representing user agent information, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It uses standard Python features and typing constructs, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward and typical for a parsing library, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of data models and interfaces for user agent parsing. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
