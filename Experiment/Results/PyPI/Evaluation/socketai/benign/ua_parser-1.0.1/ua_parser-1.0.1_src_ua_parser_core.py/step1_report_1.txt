{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures, enumerations, and protocols for parsing and representing user agent information, including browser, OS, and device details, as well as resolution mechanisms.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data inputs are explicitly read within this code; it primarily defines classes and data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code sets up data containers and protocols; it does not include execution or data flow logic involving external inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard for a user agent parsing library, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns. No obfuscated code, suspicious string manipulations, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several data classes for user agent, OS, device, and result representations, along with protocol and abstract class definitions for resolvers and matchers. All components are standard for parsing and handling user agent strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The code appears safe and typical for a parsing library. No suspicious or malicious constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated parts are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of data structures and interfaces for user agent parsing. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment. It is safe for use in a project requiring user agent analysis.",
