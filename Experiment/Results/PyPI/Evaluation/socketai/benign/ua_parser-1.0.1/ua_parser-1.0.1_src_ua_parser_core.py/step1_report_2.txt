{
  "purpose": "This source code defines data structures and protocols for parsing and representing user agent, OS, and device information from user agent strings. It provides classes for modeling parsed data, partial and complete results, and interfaces for resolvers and matchers used in user agent parsing.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are directly read in this code. The code defines classes and interfaces but does not include code that reads from files, networks, environment variables, or user input.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system commands that handle untrusted data in this code.",
  "flows": "As this code contains only class and protocol definitions, there are no runtime data flows, especially from sources to sinks, evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present. All class and method implementations are standard data modeling and protocol definitions. No dynamic code execution or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of data classes and protocols for handling user agent parsing results. The classes use immutability via frozen dataclasses, and there are no network or file operations. No input handling, command execution, or data transmission logic is present. The overall structure is typical for a parsing library, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and focused on data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard part of a user agent parsing library, defining data structures and interfaces without any suspicious or malicious elements. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this code fragment.",
