  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasonableness of scores, and the potential for malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes data structures for user agent info; no external data read.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows involving untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Code appears standard, safe, and free of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code content. No issues found, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines data models; no external input reading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data transmission or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard data classes and protocols, safe and non-malicious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe security risk score is slightly above zero, but since the code only defines data structures and interfaces, this is likely a conservative estimate. The reasoning justifies a low risk, and the malware/obfuscated scores are correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, defining data structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data class initializations; no external input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Straightforward, safe data modeling.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning supports the low scores; they are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines data classes and protocols; no external data reading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe implementation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, well-structured code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in report 2 (0.1), justified by the conservative approach to potential unknowns, but still very low and appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Slightly elevated but justified; overall very low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are consistent with the code content. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. The code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
