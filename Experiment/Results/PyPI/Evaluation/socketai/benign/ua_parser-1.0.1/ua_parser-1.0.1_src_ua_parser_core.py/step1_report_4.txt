{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and protocols for parsing user agent strings into structured data, including user agent, OS, and device information.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class constructors, default values, and function parameters, primarily dealing with string and optional data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data output mechanisms are present; no data is written to external systems or transmitted over networks.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves creating data objects and calling abstract methods for resolution, with no external or untrusted data transfer or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of data classes, enumerations, and protocols for user agent parsing. It defines clear data structures with no external side effects or data leaks. The use of Protocols and abstract methods suggests extensibility but no malicious intent. There are no indications of malware, suspicious network activity, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured library for parsing and representing user agent data without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risk based on the provided content.",
