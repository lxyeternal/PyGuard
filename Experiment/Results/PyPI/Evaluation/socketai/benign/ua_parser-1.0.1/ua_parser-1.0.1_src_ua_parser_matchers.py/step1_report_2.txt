  "purpose": "Provide regex-based matchers for UserAgent, OS, and Device data extraction in user agent strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as regex strings, user agent strings passed to __call__ methods.",
  "sinks": "Replacer function (potentially dynamic), regex pattern matching, creation of UserAgent, OS, Device objects.",
  "flows": "User input (regex, user agent strings) → pattern compilation and matching → replacer calls and object instantiations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Replacer uses user-supplied regex replacements which is typical for regex-based matching, but no unsafe operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for matching user agents, operating systems, and devices via regular expressions. Regex patterns are compiled at initialization and used during matching, with no dynamic code execution or external data fetching. The replacer function appears to be used for substituting matched groups into template strings, which is standard in regex processing. No suspicious or malicious patterns, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The design relies solely on safe regex operations and object creation, with no evident malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, regex-based matching logic for user agent parsing without any malicious or sabotage behavior. No security risks or malware indicators are detected based on the provided code. The implementation is typical for such parsers and does not contain malicious payloads.",
