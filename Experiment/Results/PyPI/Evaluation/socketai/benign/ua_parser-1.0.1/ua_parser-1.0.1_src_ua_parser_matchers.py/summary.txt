  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of regex pattern matchers for parsing user agent, OS, and device information. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified. The malware score remains at 0, and the obfuscated score at 0, reflecting the code's clarity and safety."
