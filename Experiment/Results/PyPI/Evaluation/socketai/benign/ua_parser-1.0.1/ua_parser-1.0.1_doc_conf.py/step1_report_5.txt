  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the Sphinx documentation builder",
  "sources": "os, sys modules and the script's own code",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path.insert to modify module search path; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and adjusts sys.path to include a relative directory, which is common for Sphinx configs to include local modules. No user input handling, network activity, or suspicious dynamic code execution is present. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The code strictly sets up project metadata and configuration for documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities.",
