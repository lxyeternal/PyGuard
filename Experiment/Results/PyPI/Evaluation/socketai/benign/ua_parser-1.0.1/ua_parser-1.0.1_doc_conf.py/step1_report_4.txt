  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the Sphinx documentation builder.",
  "sources": "Imports os and sys modules; modifies sys.path; reads project, author, version info; processes rst_epilog string.",
  "sinks": "sys.path modification, string variables (e.g., rst_epilog).",
  "flows": "Imports and sys.path insertion are straightforward; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected. The code is standard configuration with no obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical Sphinx configuration tasks: importing modules, adjusting sys.path, defining project info, and setting configuration variables. The sys.path modification is standard for including source code directories. The rst_epilog string contains URLs and reStructuredText directives, which are harmless. There are no dynamic evaluations, external data fetching, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for documentation setup only.",
