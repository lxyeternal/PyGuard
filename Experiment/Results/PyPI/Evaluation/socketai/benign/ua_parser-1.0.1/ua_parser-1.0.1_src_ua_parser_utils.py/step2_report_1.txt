  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is for pattern processing, no external input sources, no data leaks, no malicious code.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's content.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for pattern matching and string replacement, no external data, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Standard regex operations, no obfuscation, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — slightly elevated but justified due to regex replacement potential.\n- **Justification:** The code uses regex replacements based on match objects; if input patterns are controlled maliciously, there could be potential issues, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable. Slightly conservative securityRisk score is fine.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Pattern matching and replacement, potential vulnerability in dynamic re.sub usage.\n- **Findings:** The 'replacer' function performs regex substitution with dynamic patterns, which could be exploited if patterns are user-controlled.\n- **Analysis:** No actual malicious payloads, but the use of re.sub with user-controlled patterns could be risky if inputs are malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — justified due to potential for misuse.\n- **Conclusion:** The cautious approach is justified, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score is appropriate, but the malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Pattern matching and transformation, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Standard regex operations, no obfuscation, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report aligns with the code's content.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Pattern normalization, no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Regex transformations for pattern normalization, no external I/O, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign and the assessment is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are justified given the regex operations, especially in report 3 where dynamic re.sub could be misused if input is malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n- The functions are typical for pattern matching and string processing, with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity observed.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk:** 0.1 — due to regex operations that could be misused if inputs are malicious, but no actual exploitation or malicious intent is evident.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no security risks or malware, primarily utility functions for pattern normalization.",
