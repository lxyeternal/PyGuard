  "purpose": "Utility functions for regex pattern matching, string replacement, and pattern simplification, primarily used for processing user-agent or device strings.",
  "sources": "Match objects from regex operations, pattern strings for simplification",
  "sinks": "Regex substitution functions, pattern transformations",
  "flows": "Input patterns and match groups are used in replacer functions to produce normalized strings",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs; regex replacements are standard and controlled",
  "analysis": "The code provides pattern processing utilities with no external data sources or network activity. The functions perform regex replacements and pattern simplifications with careful handling of match groups. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The regex operations are standard, with minor concerns about dynamic replacements if inputs are malicious, but in context, this is typical for pattern normalization. The scores assigned in reports (mostly 0 for malware and obfuscation, low positive for security risk) are appropriate. The code's benign nature is consistent across all analyses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for regex-based pattern normalization and transformation, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this, setting malware and obfuscated scores to 0, and the security risk to 0, given the benign context.",
