  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code, and then synthesize an overall evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign data loader for matcher configurations, using safe YAML loaders, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, justified by the potential for untrusted data input, but overall minimal risk.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies the safe use of YAML loaders and the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard data loading, safe parsing, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, appropriate.\n- **Comments:** Correctly notes the safe handling and absence of suspicious code.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard data loading, no signs of malicious behavior, safe practices.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Well-reasoned, emphasizing the safe use of parsing functions and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward data loading, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Correctly identifies the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the code as a standard data loader, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — slightly higher, but still justified given the potential for untrusted data input, though no actual malicious activity is present.\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's functionality. No malicious code, network activity, or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal potential risk from untrusted data input, which is justified given the functions accept external files. The code itself does not perform any unsafe operations beyond data parsing.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a straightforward, safe data loader for matcher configurations.\n- Uses safe YAML loaders (`CSafeLoader` or `SafeLoader`) if available.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The potential risk arises only if untrusted data is supplied, but this is inherent to any data loader and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by the potential for untrusted input, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and reasonable. The code appears benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the low risk score reflects the minimal inherent danger of loading external data.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.",
