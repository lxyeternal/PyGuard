{
  "purpose": "The code loads matcher configuration data from JSON or YAML files into matcher objects for user-agent, OS, and device parsing.",
  "sources": "File reads via open() or file-like objects, loading JSON or YAML data structures.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed into matcher objects; no malicious sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "File input -> json.load()/load() -> data structures -> matcher object constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads structured data from external files using standard libraries and safe YAML loaders. It converts data into matcher objects without executing code or performing network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The use of safe loaders indicates attention to security best practices. The data is used solely for pattern matching, with no malicious intent or backdoors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data loader for matcher configurations, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The low security risk scores are appropriate given its purpose and safe practices.",
