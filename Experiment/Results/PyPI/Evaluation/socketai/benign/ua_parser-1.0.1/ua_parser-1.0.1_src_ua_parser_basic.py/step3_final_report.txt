  "purpose": "A regex-based resolver class for parsing user-agent strings and domain information, with environment-specific regex compilation optimization.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns in matchers, pattern attribute in matchers, user-agent string input (ua).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input ua flows into matchers via methodcaller('__call__', ua), results are filtered and returned as PartialResult.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional regex recompilation when IS_GRAAL is true; use of fa_simplifier to modify regex patterns; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward regex parser for user-agent and domain info, with environment-specific regex recompilation for optimization. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The use of methodcaller for dynamic invocation is standard. The fa_simplifier likely normalizes regex patterns without malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The regex recompilation based on IS_GRAAL appears to be an environment optimization, not malicious. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk~0.1-0.2 are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, regex-based user-agent and domain parser with environment-specific regex handling. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The existing scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
