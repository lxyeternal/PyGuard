  "sources": "Regex patterns in matchers, user agent string input, class instantiation, and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Pattern compilation and replacement, regex matching functions, and the methodcaller invocation.",
  "flows": "Matcher patterns are compiled or simplified upon initialization if IS_GRAAL; __call__ method applies matchers to input ua string and filters results.",
  "anomalies": "Pattern rewriting during __init__ based on IS_GRAAL; no obvious hardcoded secrets or malicious code; use of dynamic methodcaller and regex compilation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Resolver class that uses regex matchers to analyze user agent strings and domain data. During initialization, if IS_GRAAL is true, it attempts to optimize regex patterns either eagerly (by compiling patterns) or lazily (by modifying attributes). The __call__ method applies the matchers to the user agent string, filtering results based on domain flags. No external data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are evident. The pattern compilation or modification is a standard optimization technique and does not suggest malicious intent. The use of methodcaller for calling matchers is standard. Overall, the code appears to be a typical regex-based resolver with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard regex matcher implementation for user agent parsing with optimization based on environment flags. There are no indicators of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or malicious behavior. The pattern rewriting during __init__ is an optimization step, not malicious activity.",
