  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a comprehensive user-agent parsing library that uses regex patterns, with optional external YAML configuration.\n- No direct network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The main concern is the use of environment variables and external YAML files for configuration, which could be manipulated to introduce malicious regex patterns or cause DoS via catastrophic backtracking.\n- The code employs safe YAML loaders and standard regex operations, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard UA parsing.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, considering configuration reliance)\n- **Verdict:** The analysis is correct. The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** External YAML configuration via environment variable could be manipulated, but no malicious code detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. External config loading is a potential attack vector but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** No dangerous code, only regex parsing, safe YAML loading.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** External YAML configuration, but no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. External configuration is a risk but not malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behaviors, just regex parsing with external YAML config.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malware presence.\n- **Obfuscated:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** The main concern is external YAML configuration via environment variables, which could be manipulated but does not constitute malware or malicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to external YAML configuration dependency, which could be exploited but is not inherently malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured user-agent parser with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The main security consideration is ensuring the external YAML configuration is loaded from trusted sources, but this is a common pattern and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo changes are needed to the scores assigned in the reports. They are consistent with the code analysis.",
