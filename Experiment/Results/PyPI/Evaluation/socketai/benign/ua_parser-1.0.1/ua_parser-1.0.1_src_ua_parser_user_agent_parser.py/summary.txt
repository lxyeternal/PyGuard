  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured user agent parser with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the external YAML configuration, which could be manipulated if the environment is compromised, but this does not constitute malware. The scores are accurate and appropriate."
