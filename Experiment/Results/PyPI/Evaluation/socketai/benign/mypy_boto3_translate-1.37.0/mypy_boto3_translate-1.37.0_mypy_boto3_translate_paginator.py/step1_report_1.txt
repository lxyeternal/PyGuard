  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginator class for the AWS Translate client's 'list_terminologies' operation to facilitate type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from sys.version_info, importing modules and types, defining class and method with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "The paginate method could accept untrusted keyword arguments (**kwargs) of type Unpack[ListTerminologiesRequestPaginateTypeDef], which may be user-controlled if improperly used.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data in **kwargs flows into the paginate method, which passes it to the underlying Paginator.paginate, potentially influencing behavior if malicious input is supplied.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for conditional import is normal; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations for a paginator class, inheriting from a base Paginator. It conditionally imports Unpack based on Python version and defines a class with a method that accepts arbitrary keyword arguments. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code is consistent with standard type hinting and class extension patterns for boto3 stubs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for type annotation purposes in boto3 stubs, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly enhances type safety for the paginator class. Overall, it is safe.",
