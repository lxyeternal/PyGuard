  "purpose": "Type annotations for translate service client paginators to facilitate type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method definitions, and type annotations",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily type annotation and class inheritance structure.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes version-dependent imports, but no suspicious or unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. It mostly provides type annotations and documentation references.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a paginator class for AWS Translate service, including type annotations and documentation links. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, and inherits from standard boto3 paginator classes. No runtime data handling, external input processing, or sensitive operations are present. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The code appears to be a standard type-annotated wrapper for boto3 paginators, intended to improve developer experience.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, type annotation-focused module for boto3 paginator classes with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
