  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS translate service configuration options and constants.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module; defining literal types; no external data inputs or runtime data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues; no data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import for typing.Literal based on Python version, which is standard practice; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. No obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines string literal types for type annotations related to AWS translate service. It includes conditional importing for compatibility with different Python versions. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external calls, or potentially dangerous code constructs. The purpose is purely to provide type hints, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module for type annotations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and purpose-specific, with no anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
