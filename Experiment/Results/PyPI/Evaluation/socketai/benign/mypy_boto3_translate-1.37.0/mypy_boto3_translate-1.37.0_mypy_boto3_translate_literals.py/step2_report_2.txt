  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code solely consists of static string literal definitions for AWS service names, regions, statuses, and configuration options.\n- The import logic for `Literal` adapts based on Python version, which is standard.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data handling, network calls, or user input processing.\n- No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data embedded.\n- No obfuscation, code injection, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose is clearly to improve type safety and code clarity in a boto3 context.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS services, regions, and identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Fully benign; static type annotations. No malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS translate service options.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; purely static definitions for type hints. No vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Define AWS resource names, regions, etc., for boto3-stubs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static constants, no dynamic behavior, no external inputs. Completely safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (slightly above zero).  \n**Note:** The risk score is very low, which is appropriate given the static nature. Slightly above zero might be for precaution, but it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, extensive AWS SDK parameter literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious patterns; purely static, comprehensive constants.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Define AWS SDK parameters and identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static definitions, no external data or dynamic code. Safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. Malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are correct at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, read-only nature, risk scores are appropriately low (mostly 0, with one at 0.1). No evidence suggests any higher risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Expert Conclusion:\n\n**The code is a well-structured, static set of type annotations and constants for AWS SDKs, serving as type hints for static analysis and IDE support. There are no signs of supply chain security issues, malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.**\n\n**Proposed Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.1 for very conservative precaution, but 0 is more accurate)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The current scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain component is safe, benign, and purely declarative. It poses no security threat.",
