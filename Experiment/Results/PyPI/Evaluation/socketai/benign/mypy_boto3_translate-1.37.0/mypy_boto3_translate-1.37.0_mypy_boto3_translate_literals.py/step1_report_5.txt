  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS SDK parameters to enable type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for string types, imported 'sys' for version check.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no output sinks, no data leaks, no system modification.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of static type definitions and version-based imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version. It then defines numerous string literal types representing AWS resource identifiers, statuses, configurations, and options. There are no dynamic executions, external inputs, or sensitive data handling. The content is purely declarative, intended for static type checking. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a harmless, well-structured set of literal definitions for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, static set of type literals for AWS SDK parameter definitions. It contains no malicious intent, no external data handling, and no security risks. It is safe and purely serves type annotation purposes.",
