  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS services, regions, and configurations to be used with boto3-stubs for type safety and code hints.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions assigned to variables, import statements, and version checks for typing module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external output occurring.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is only defining constants and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations using Literal for various AWS resource names, regions, and service identifiers, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version. It includes documentation comments and standard boilerplate for type safety. No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. All elements are purely static definitions intended for type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, static set of type aliases for better code completion and type safety when working with AWS SDKs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain security threats in this code.",
