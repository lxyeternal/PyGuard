  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS service names, regions, statuses, and configuration options to enhance type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions for AWS services, regions, statuses, and identifiers; conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, external calls, or dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Purely static definitions; no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static constants with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string literal type aliases used for type hinting in AWS SDK contexts. It employs standard conditional import for compatibility. No external data, network activity, secrets, or obfuscation are present. Multiple reviews confirm the absence of malicious or suspicious elements. The minimal security risk score (0.1 in one report) is a conservative estimate, but the code's static nature justifies a zero score. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a static, safe set of type annotations for AWS SDK constants. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores are consistent with the code's static and benign nature.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
