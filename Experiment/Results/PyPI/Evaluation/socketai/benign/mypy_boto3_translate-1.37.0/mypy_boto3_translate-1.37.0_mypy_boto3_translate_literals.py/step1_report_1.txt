{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS services, regions, and identifiers to enhance type safety and code clarity in a boto3-based translation service.",
  "sources": "The code sources input data primarily through the definitions of Literal types, which are static string constants used for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe if user input or external data is assigned to these types without validation, but the code itself does not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "The defined Literal types serve as type annotations for variables elsewhere in the codebase; there are no data flows within this module itself.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. It employs conditional import for compatibility, which is standard. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple Literal types for various AWS service names, regions, and other identifiers, primarily for type hinting in Python. The import logic for 'Literal' adapts based on Python version, which is standard. There are no data processing, external calls, or dynamic evaluations that could introduce security issues. The code appears solely as type annotations with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a straightforward, well-structured set of type annotations intended to improve type safety and code clarity. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use within a larger codebase.",
