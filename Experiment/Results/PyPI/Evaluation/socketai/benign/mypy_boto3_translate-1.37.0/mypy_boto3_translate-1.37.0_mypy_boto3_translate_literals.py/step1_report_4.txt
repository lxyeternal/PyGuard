{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS SDK service and configuration options, primarily for type checking and code assistance.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and typing_extensions; hardcoded string literals assigned to type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous extensive literal definitions, but no signs of malicious intent or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type aliases using Literal for a wide range of AWS SDK service names, region codes, and configuration options. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. No external input handling, no network operations, and no executable code besides static definitions. The structure is typical for a type stub or constants module. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns; the large set of literals appears to be a comprehensive set of constants for AWS SDK interactions. No potential security vulnerabilities or malware features identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward collection of type literal definitions intended for type safety and documentation purposes. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a static constants module with no dynamic or malicious operations.",
