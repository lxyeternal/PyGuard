  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It reads `sys.argv` for `--version` and writes static info to `stdout`.\n- No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or user input beyond command-line args.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The copyright year is in the future (2025), but this is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain any issues or malicious behavior.\n- The logic is correct, and no anomalies are detected.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025), which might be a typo or oversight, but it does not impact security.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk:** mostly 0, with some reports assigning 0.1, likely reflecting the minimal risk from the `sys.argv` input being read, but since the input is only used for control flow and not for data processing, this is acceptable.\n\n### Reasonableness of scores:\n- The assigned scores seem reasonable; no report indicates any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is acceptable given the use of command-line arguments, but since there's no processing of untrusted data, this is negligible.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is static and benign.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as a benign CLI utility.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The overall assessment aligns with the reports: **no malware, no obfuscation, and negligible security risk**.\n- The only adjustment I might suggest is to standardize the security risk score to 0 across all reports, as the minimal risk from reading command-line args is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** (negligible security risk; the use of command-line args is standard and safe here)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, benign CLI utility with no security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The minimal security risk score should be 0, not 0.1, to reflect the absence of any real security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is safe, with no supply chain security issues. It is a simple informational script with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
