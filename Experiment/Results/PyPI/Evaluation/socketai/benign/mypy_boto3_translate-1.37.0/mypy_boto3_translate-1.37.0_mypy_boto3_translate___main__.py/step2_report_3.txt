  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code only reads command-line arguments and writes static strings to stdout.\n- No external network calls, data leakage, or dynamic code execution.\n- Slight variation in the security risk score (0.0 or 0.1), but all are minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  The code is simple and aligns with the reports. No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **No logical flaws detected.** The code functions as intended, with clear and safe logic.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0.0 or 0.1. Given the benign nature, a score of 0.0 seems appropriate, but a minimal 0.1 for the slight future copyright date is acceptable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- **Risk score > 0.5?**  \n  No, all are well below 0.5, indicating no significant security concern.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code only outputs static information and does not process untrusted input beyond a simple argument check.\n- No assumptions of vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0.0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0.0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.0** (or at most 0.1, but 0.0 is justified given the benign nature)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a minimal, safe CLI utility that outputs static package info and version. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign and correctly scored.  \n- No changes needed in the scores.  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.0\n\nand consider the future copyright date as a non-issue.",
