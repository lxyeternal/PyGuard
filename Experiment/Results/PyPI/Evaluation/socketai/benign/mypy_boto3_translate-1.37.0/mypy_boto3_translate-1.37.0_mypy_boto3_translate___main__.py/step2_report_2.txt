  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It imports only `sys`, defines functions to print info and version, and handles `--version` argument.\n- No user input beyond command-line args, no network calls, no dynamic code, no secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future but not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Issues in code presence:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and benign. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code detected.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0.0` and `obfuscated: 0.0`. This is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Security Risk:**  \n  The risk scores are mostly `0.0` or `0.1`. Given the code's benign nature, these seem appropriate. The small `0.1` scores are possibly due to the `sys.argv` input, but since the input is only used for comparison and does not influence code execution or data flow beyond static outputs, this is acceptable.\n\n- **Flow & Data Handling:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the data flow is limited to command-line argument checking and static output, with no external data or dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  No report suggests any vulnerabilities based on assumptions. The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign `0.0`. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Correctly `0.0`. No obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Slight variation (`0.0` or `0.1`). Given the code's simplicity, `0.0` would be more accurate, but `0.1` is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward.\n- **Malware risk:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, given the static nature and no external dependencies or dynamic code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0**  \n  No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0**  \n  Clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0.0**  \n  The code is benign; minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are consistent with my assessment. The code is a simple, safe CLI utility with no security concerns or malicious intent. The slight variation in security risk scores (0.0 vs 0.1) is acceptable, but for accuracy, I would set it at **0.0**.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign and static nature.",
