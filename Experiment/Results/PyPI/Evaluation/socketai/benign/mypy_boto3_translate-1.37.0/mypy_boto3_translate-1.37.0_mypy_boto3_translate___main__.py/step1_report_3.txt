  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script that outputs package information or version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, reading sys.argv for command-line parameters",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) -> print_version() or print_info() -> sys.stdout.write output",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The copyright year is in the future (2025), but this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, providing CLI commands to print package info or version. It reads command-line arguments to determine output. No external data sources, network operations, or user input beyond command-line args are involved. No secrets or suspicious logic are present. The code does not include any obfuscated or malicious behavior. The only notable point is the future copyright date, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs package info or version. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with no supply chain security concerns.",
