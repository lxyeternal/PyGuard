{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entry point that outputs package information or version details for a specific Python package.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs information to stdout)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data), which could be exploited if manipulated inputs were used, but here it's only static text",
  "flows": "Command line input (e.g., '--version') triggers output functions; data flows from input to output but is only predefined static strings",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors; the code only outputs static package info and version details without external data handling or dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The script checks for a command line argument '--version' to display the package version, otherwise it prints package info. There are no external data inputs or network connections. The code is straightforward, with no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The functions perform simple static outputs, and the overall structure is minimal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI utility that outputs package information or version details. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. The code appears safe and benign.",
