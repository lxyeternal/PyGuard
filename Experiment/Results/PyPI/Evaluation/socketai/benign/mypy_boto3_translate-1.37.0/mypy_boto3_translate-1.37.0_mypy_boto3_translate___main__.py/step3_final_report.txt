{
  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to stdout; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), otherwise print_info() is called; no data flow beyond static output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and benign",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and checks sys.argv for '--version'. It outputs static information without external network calls, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The future copyright year (2025) is noted but not security-relevant. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm it is benign with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The minimal security risk score should be 0, as there are no security concerns or malicious behaviors.",
