  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point to display package information or version details for a software package related to boto3 Translate.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), and writes output to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to stdout based on command-line input; no data sinks for untrusted input or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv is checked for '--version'; if present, triggers print_version(), otherwise triggers print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for I/O operations, defines functions to print package info and version, and handles command-line arguments to determine output. No user input beyond command-line arguments, no network calls, and no sensitive data handling. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for displaying package info and version, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
