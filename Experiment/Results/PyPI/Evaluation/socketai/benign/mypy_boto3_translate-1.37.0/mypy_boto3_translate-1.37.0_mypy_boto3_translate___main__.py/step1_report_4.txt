  "purpose": "Provide CLI interface to display package information and version details for a boto3 stub package.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "If '--version' argument is present, calls print_version() -> outputs version info; otherwise, calls print_info() -> outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. No external network calls or data collection evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI tool that responds to '--version' argument by printing the package version, and by default, prints static package info. No untrusted data processing, no external data sources, no dynamic code execution. The code only interacts with sys.argv and sys.stdout, both standard and safe operations. The license comment and function definitions are typical. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI utility for displaying static package information. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and its security risk is negligible.",
