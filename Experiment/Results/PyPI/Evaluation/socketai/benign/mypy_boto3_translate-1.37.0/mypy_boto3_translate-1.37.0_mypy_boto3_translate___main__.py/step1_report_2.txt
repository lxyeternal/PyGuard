  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs package info and version)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data), sys.argv (reads user input)",
  "flows": "Command-line input (e.g., --version) triggers print_version() which outputs version info to stdout; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and a main function to handle CLI arguments. It only outputs static information based on command-line input. There are no indications of data leakage, external connections, or malicious logic. The script's purpose is solely informational, and it follows standard practices for a CLI utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply outputs static package information and version details when invoked.",
