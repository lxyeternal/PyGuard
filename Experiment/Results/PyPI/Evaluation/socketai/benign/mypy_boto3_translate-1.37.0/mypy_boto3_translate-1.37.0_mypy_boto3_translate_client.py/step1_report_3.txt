  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for Amazon Translate service, providing method signatures and exception handling for SDK users.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules, class definitions, method definitions, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that could potentially handle untrusted input via **kwargs, but these are standard SDK method signatures.",
  "flows": "Input parameters via **kwargs are unpacked into specific request types; no explicit data flows or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden backdoors observed. All methods are standard SDK signatures. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface definition with type annotations, class structures, and method signatures. It includes a custom Exceptions class for error handling. No malicious behaviors or suspicious code patterns detected. All components are consistent with typical SDK design, focusing on documentation and typing support.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK interface for Amazon Translate with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It primarily provides type annotations, class structure, and method signatures for SDK users. No security risks or malicious behaviors identified.",
