{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 Translate client, serving as static analysis aids and SDK stubs.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, type annotations, documentation links, class and property definitions, kwargs unpacking.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data in method parameters such as 'Params' in generate_presigned_url, resource ARNs, and tags; no actual data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method input parameters (kwargs) to SDK calls; no dynamic or executable code present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; purely declarative interface.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type annotations and class definitions for the AWS Translate SDK, with no executable logic or data processing. It includes method signatures, documentation links, and exception classes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or sabotage are present. The minimal potential security concern relates to untrusted data in URL generation or resource tagging, which is standard for SDK interfaces and not malicious. The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the code's benign, structural nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured SDK stub with no malicious or obfuscated content. It serves as a static typing aid and interface layer for the boto3 Translate client, with no signs of sabotage or malicious activity.",
