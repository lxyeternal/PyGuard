  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its structure, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Purely descriptive, no data sources involved.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or untrusted data handling, just method signatures.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious logic.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, standard SDK interface with high confidence.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward SDK stub.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potentially untrusted data in methods like `generate_presigned_url`, but these are standard parameters.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation; the code is typical for SDK definitions.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious activity, high confidence.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (small, due to potential untrusted input handling).  \n  *This small risk is acceptable given the nature of SDK code.*  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, standard SDK interface.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Untrusted data could flow via kwargs, but these are standard SDK signatures.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious logic.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected, full confidence.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard type annotations and class definitions.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from kwargs could be untrusted, but this is typical in SDK stub definitions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code; purely type hints and interface definitions.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious activity, high confidence.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, SDK interface, mainly type annotations.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data may flow through method parameters, but no actual logic or data handling occurs here.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious code, just interface definitions.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, safe for use.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign **0**, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign **0**, consistent with the code being straightforward, well-structured SDK stubs, not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk Score:** All are at **0** or very close to it, which is appropriate given the purely structural, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent and well-structured.  \n- **Risk:** **0** — no security risk detected; this is a type stub/interface code.\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThe code is a set of type annotations and interface definitions for AWS SDK, serving as static analysis aids. It contains no executable logic, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no malicious payloads. The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the actual content and purpose of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.",
