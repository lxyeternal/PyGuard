  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no data inputs, external calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - The code contains only comments, copyright notices, and a straightforward assignment.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is standard for package versioning, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Scores:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The security risk score is also 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n   - Confidence is high (1) in all reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors:**\n   - No logical flaws or errors are identified.\n   - The code is minimal and follows best practices for version declaration.\n\n5. **Assessment of the Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a canonical example of version declaration in Python packages.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are justified.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, standard, and carries no security concerns. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
