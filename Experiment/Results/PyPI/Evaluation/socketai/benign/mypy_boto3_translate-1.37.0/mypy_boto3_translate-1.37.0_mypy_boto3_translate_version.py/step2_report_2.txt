  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No dynamic code, input/output, or external data handling.\n- No obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code is standard practice in Python packages for versioning.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that this code is benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the logic, reasoning, and summaries:\n- All reports consistently state that this is a simple, static version declaration.\n- They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- The reasoning is sound: no malicious behavior, no vulnerabilities, no obfuscation.\n\n**Errors or flaws in reports?**  \n- None detected. All reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating the scores:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements, the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- The highest score assigned is 1, which is appropriate because the code is benign.\n- No higher scores are warranted since there's no evidence of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging claims based on assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the code is straightforward.\n- The comments and structure do not suggest any hidden behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the analysis, I concur with the existing scores. The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- Scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as-is: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.",
