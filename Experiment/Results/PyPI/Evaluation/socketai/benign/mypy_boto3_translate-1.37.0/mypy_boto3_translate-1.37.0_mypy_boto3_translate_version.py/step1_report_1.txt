  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = \"1.37.0\".",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data usage observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply sets a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment header and a single variable assignment setting the __version__ attribute. The comment indicates it is a 'source of truth for version,' which is standard practice. The version string is hardcoded but harmless. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors or code obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent, no security risks, and no anomalies. The code appears benign and standard for package versioning.",
