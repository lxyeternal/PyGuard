{
  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for version control and reference.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it contains only a comment and a variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the version string is statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to __version__, with an accompanying comment. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, external calls, or obfuscation. The code is standard practice in Python packaging for versioning purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, secrets, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
