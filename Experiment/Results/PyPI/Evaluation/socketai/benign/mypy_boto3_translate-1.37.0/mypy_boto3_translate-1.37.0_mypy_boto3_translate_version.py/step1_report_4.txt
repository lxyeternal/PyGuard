  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external calls",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version string assignment, normal for package metadata",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice, and a version variable assignment with a static string. No input handling, external calls, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. The version string appears standard and there are no hidden or malicious behaviors. The code is typical for Python package version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version declaration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks.",
