  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`, with accompanying comments.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - No factual inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in any of the reports.\n   - All reports correctly interpret the code as benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Score Justifications and Consistency**:\n   - **Malware Score**:\n     - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Security Risk Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, aligning with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores**:\n   - Since the code is purely a static version assignment with no external interactions, raising the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores would be unjustified.\n   - The reports are consistent in this regard.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n\n**Final Expert Judgment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely declarative, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary. The code is entirely benign and standard for versioning in Python packages.",
