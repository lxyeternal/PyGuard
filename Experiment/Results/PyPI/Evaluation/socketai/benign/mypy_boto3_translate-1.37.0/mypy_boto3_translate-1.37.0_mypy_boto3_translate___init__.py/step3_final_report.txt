  "purpose": "A minimal interface module for AWS translate services, importing classes from local modules and exposing them for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from .client and .paginator modules, and the documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or network calls present.",
  "flows": "Static imports and exports; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static interface wrapper with no runtime logic, data handling, or network activity. It contains only class imports, an alias, and documentation. The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not suspicious. All security and malware scores are zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
