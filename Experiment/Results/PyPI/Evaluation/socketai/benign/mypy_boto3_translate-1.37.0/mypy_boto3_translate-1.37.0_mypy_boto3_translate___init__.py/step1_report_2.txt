{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the AWS translate service, importing client classes and setting up module exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.client, .paginator) and the module docstring.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports classes and assigns a variable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The copyright date appears intentionally set to 2025, which is plausible for a future-dated project but is not suspicious in itself.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains documentation, imports, and straightforward variable assignments. No input reading, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted data. The relative imports suggest this is part of a larger package, but on its own, it does not perform any potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup for AWS translate client functionality, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not include any data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations.",
