{
  "purpose": "Main interface for the AWS Translate service, providing access to client and paginator classes for translation functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), no external data input, and no runtime data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely defining imports and aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The license year (2025) appears inconsistent but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports client and paginator classes from local modules, defines an alias, and sets __all__. It includes a docstring with documentation links and usage examples. No user input handling, no network operations, and no security-sensitive data processing are present. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward interface module for a translation service client, with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply organizes and exposes components for use in other modules.",
