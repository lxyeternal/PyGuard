{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Translate service API requests and responses in Python, providing structured data types for use with boto3.",
  "sources": "The code defines data type schemas using TypedDict, imports from standard libraries, and external modules. No user input or external data sources are processed at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None present. The code does not include any functions or executable logic that sends data to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "There are no execution flows or data processing paths; the code solely defines static type schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code uses conditional imports for type hints based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type annotations and schema definitions for AWS Translate API requests and responses. It imports necessary modules, handles version-dependent imports, and defines various TypedDict classes for structured data. There are no functions, executable statements, or external data processing. The code does not perform any I/O, network operations, or include malicious logic. It is a standard type definition module intended for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a non-malicious, standard Python module defining data types for AWS Translate SDK interactions. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks present in this static type declaration code.",
