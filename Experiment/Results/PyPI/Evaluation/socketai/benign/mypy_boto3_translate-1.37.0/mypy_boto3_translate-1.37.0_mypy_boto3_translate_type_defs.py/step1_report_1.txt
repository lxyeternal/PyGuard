{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Translate service data structures to facilitate type-safe SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard libraries, third-party typing_extensions, and local literals; class and variable definitions; type annotations including Dict, List, Union, Literal, TypedDict.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or outputted, as the code mainly consists of type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code strictly defines data structures without executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely type annotations and class definitions with no runtime code, no hardcoded credentials, no network connections, and no suspicious imports or obfuscated code. Use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes data structure definitions for AWS Translate SDK, with conditional imports based on Python version. It uses standard Python typing practices to define types like TypedDict, Union, and Literal. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, no credential handling, or other potentially malicious constructs. The structure is consistent with SDK type definitions and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of type annotations for AWS SDK data structures, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is purely for type safety and documentation purposes.",
