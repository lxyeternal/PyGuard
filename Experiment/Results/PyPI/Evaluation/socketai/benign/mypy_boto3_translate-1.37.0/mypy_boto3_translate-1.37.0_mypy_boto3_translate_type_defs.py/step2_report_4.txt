  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as purely type annotations for AWS Translate SDK, with no runtime logic.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately notes that the code is static type definitions, with no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.  \n**Verdict:** Fully justified. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, accurate.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime logic, no external data processing.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is purely type definitions, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.  \n**Verdict:** Justified. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No executable code, no data leaks or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the code as static type annotations for AWS SDK, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.  \n**Verdict:** Well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime logic, just data structures.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is purely type annotations, with no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, no external calls, no obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly concludes that the code is static type definitions, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.  \n**Verdict:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward type annotations, not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—strictly static type definitions with no runtime logic—setting the risk score at **0** is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely type annotations for AWS SDK data structures, with no executable logic, no network activity, no secrets, and no obfuscation.  \n- The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe, static, and intended solely for type safety and documentation.",
