  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, analyzing the purpose, sources, sinks, data flows, anomalies, and conclusions, then assess their accuracy and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Define type annotations for AWS Translate SDK data structures.  \n- **Analysis:** The code is purely type definitions, with no runtime logic, network activity, or data processing. Use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The report accurately describes the code as static type annotations with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS Translate API requests/responses.  \n- **Analysis:** The code is entirely static, defining data schemas with no executable logic or external data handling. Use of standard typing practices.  \n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The report's conclusion aligns with the code's static nature.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS Translate SDK, facilitating structured data types.  \n- **Analysis:** The code contains only type annotations, class definitions, and imports. No runtime logic, no network or data exfiltration, no secrets or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Purely type annotations, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a static schema with no security concerns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Type definitions and annotations for SDK, for type safety.  \n- **Analysis:** Same as above—only static data structure definitions, no runtime code, no external interactions.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Type definitions and annotations, potential data leaks through response data or untrusted input.  \n- **Analysis:** While the report mentions potential data leaks, it correctly notes that the code is purely type annotations and data schemas. It also points out that no executable code or dynamic behaviors exist.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or sabotage activity; serves as static schema.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The mention of potential data leaks is theoretical; the code itself does not perform any data handling or network activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is solely composed of static type annotations, data schemas, and import statements, with no executable logic, network activity, or malicious behavior. The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n**Final Justification:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as there is no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since the code is straightforward and uses standard practices.  \n- **Risk score:** 0, because static type definitions do not pose security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The entire set of reports is accurate and consistent with the code. There are no security concerns or malicious elements present.",
