  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Translate SDK, serving as static type hints for SDK users.",
  "sources": "Type definitions, class declarations, conditional imports based on Python version, literals, and TypedDict structures.",
  "sinks": "None; static type annotations do not process untrusted data or perform runtime actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution; purely declarative type schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward type definitions with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDict classes, and conditional imports for compatibility. No executable logic, network calls, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The use of conditional imports and type hints aligns with best practices for SDK type definitions. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, serving as static type definitions for AWS Translate SDK. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores of malware, obfuscated code, and overall risk are correctly set to 0, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
