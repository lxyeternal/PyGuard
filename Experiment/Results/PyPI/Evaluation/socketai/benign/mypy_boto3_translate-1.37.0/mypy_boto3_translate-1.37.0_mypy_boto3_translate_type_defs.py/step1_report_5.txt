  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for the AWS Translate service SDK, enabling type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, type annotations, class and variable declarations, and data structure definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through response data, configuration parameters, or untrusted input data such as S3 URIs and tokens.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., S3Uri, input files, request parameters) flow into function calls or data structures; responses and metadata flow back as output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns. Usage of standard AWS SDK types, conditional imports for compatibility, and type annotations are typical. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely type definition and interface declarations for the boto3 translation SDK. It uses standard Python features, conditional imports for compatibility, and typing constructs to define request/response structures. No execution logic, no data processing, nor external calls or network activities are present. The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, code injection, or hidden behavior. All data structures align with expected AWS API schemas, and there are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard set of type definitions for the AWS Translate SDK, with no malicious or sabotage behavior. It serves to facilitate type checking and improve code clarity. There is no evidence of malware, security risks, or suspicious activity within this code.",
