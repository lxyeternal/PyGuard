  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and consistency of scores.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is purely type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Translate SDK, with no executable logic, network operations, or malicious behavior.\n- Confidence levels are high (1), and malware and security risk scores are zero.\n- No anomalies or obfuscation are detected; the code uses standard practices like conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- The purpose across all reports is consistent: defining data schemas for SDK usage.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\n\n- The code is **strictly type annotations and class definitions** using TypedDict, Union, Literal, etc.\n- No functions, no runtime logic, no data processing, no network or file I/O.\n- Imports are standard and include conditional handling for Python version differences.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and typical for SDK type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- No apparent logical flaws; the type definitions align with expected AWS SDK data structures.\n- The use of `NotRequired` and `Literal` is appropriate for optional fields and fixed string values.\n- Conditional imports based on Python version are standard and correctly implemented.\n- No suspicious or invalid type annotations.\n\n**Conclusion:** No logical errors or flaws are present.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nNo, the scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no runtime behaviors, external data handling, or executable code that could be exploited.\n- The only potential concern might be if the code were to be used improperly (e.g., accepting untrusted data), but that is outside the scope of static type definitions.\n\n**Conclusion:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is **standard type annotations** for an SDK, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate (after thorough review):\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score   | 0                 | No executable code, no network or malicious logic.                                              |\n| Obfuscated Score| 0                | Clear, standard type annotations with no obfuscation.                                            |\n| Risk Score      | 0                 | Static definitions without runtime or external interactions; no security risks identified.    |\n\n**Final note:** The code is purely for static type checking and documentation, serving as a safe and standard part of SDK development.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; the code is safe, non-malicious, and well-structured. No adjustments needed.",
