{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for the AWS Translate service SDK, providing structured data types for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals, imported modules, and type annotations within the code. No external input sources are directly read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points include data being stored in variables, returned by functions, or potentially sent over the network if used improperly. No explicit network activity or data exfiltration code is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources like function parameters or external data (e.g., S3 URIs in configs) through typed structures. No untrusted data is directly used in dangerous operations such as executing commands or writing files.",
  "anomalies": "The code is primarily type definitions and imports; it contains no executable logic, command execution, or dynamic code evaluation. The use of Literal and NotRequired is standard for optional fields. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, class definitions, and import statements intended to define data structures for the AWS SDK. There are no functions, data processing logic, or runtime behavior. It does not perform any I/O, network activity, or system modifications. No malicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The use of type annotations and constants aligns with standard SDK development practices. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of type definitions for the AWS Translate SDK, serving as schema for request and response objects. It does not contain executable or malicious code. The code is purely declarative, focusing on data structure definitions without any behavior that could be malicious.",
