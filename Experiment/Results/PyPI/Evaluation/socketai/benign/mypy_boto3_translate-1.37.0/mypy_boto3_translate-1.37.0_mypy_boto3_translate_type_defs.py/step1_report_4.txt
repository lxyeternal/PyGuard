{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for AWS Translate service SDK, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party typing extensions, and internal literals; type annotations within class and variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present; code primarily consists of data structure definitions without runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "Data structures define input/output formats but do not include runtime data flows; no executable flows or data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs; use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard, not malicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely comprises type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions. No code executes logic, interacts with external systems, or performs data handling. The absence of dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks indicates no malicious intent. The structure and content align with typical SDK type definition files.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard type definition module for AWS SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely for type safety and documentation purposes, with no runtime execution or external interactions.",
