  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-translate package, defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignment without dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that imports pathlib and setuptools, reads a local README.md file, and calls setup() with static parameters. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses no security risk.",
