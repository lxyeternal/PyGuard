  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the actual code content.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package.\n- The code reads a local README.md file, imports standard modules, and calls `setup()` with static metadata.\n- No dynamic code, network operations, or external data handling is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), indicating certainty about benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code:** No issues are present. The code is standard and safe.\n- **Malware presence:** None detected; malware score remains 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; obfuscation score remains 0.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; scores are 0.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the script is a benign setup configuration.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The only potential concern might be the URL pointing to a GitHub repository, but it appears legitimate and related to package setup.\n\n### Final recommendation:\nGiven the thorough review, **the scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and reasonable**. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe Python package setup script with no security concerns.",
