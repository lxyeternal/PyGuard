{
  "purpose": "Static analysis tool ('lizard') for multiple programming languages, measuring code complexity metrics and generating reports.",
  "sources": "Reads source files, supports extension modules, processes ignore patterns, loads extensions dynamically based on user input.",
  "sinks": "Uses open() for file reading/writing, stdout for reports, extension modules may execute code during import.",
  "flows": "Source files and extension names -> analysis functions -> report generation.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of extensions via user-controlled strings, potential vector if malicious extensions are supplied.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of source files, calculating metrics like NLOC, CCN, token count, etc. It dynamically loads extension modules based on user input, which could be exploited if untrusted modules are used. No network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation are present. The extension import pattern is standard for plugin architectures but warrants validation in secure environments.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate static analysis utility with no malicious intent. The primary security concern is the dynamic extension loading, which should be validated or sandboxed to prevent potential exploitation. No signs of malware or obfuscation are detected.",
