  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and considering the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign static analysis tool ('lizard') for multiple languages, with standard file I/O, extension modules, and report generation. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code detected.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The report correctly notes the use of dynamic extension imports, which could be a vector if malicious extensions are supplied. However, in the code, extensions are imported explicitly via `import_module` with user-controlled strings, which could be exploited if untrusted modules are provided.\n  - No evidence of code obfuscation, network activity, or malicious payloads.\n  - The code is well-structured, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is accurate. The malware score should remain **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0.2** (due to extension import potential).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate static analysis tool with no malicious behavior. It reads files, computes metrics, and outputs reports. No network or secret data handling.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The report emphasizes the lack of suspicious activity, which aligns with the code.\n  - The only potential concern is extension loading, but no malicious extensions are present.\n  - The code uses standard libraries and safe file handling.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correct. Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0.1**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with emphasis on dynamic import of extensions based on user input, which could be exploited if malicious modules are supplied.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The dynamic import via `import_module` with user-supplied strings is a potential attack vector if untrusted extension names are used.\n  - No evidence of code obfuscation, network activity, or malicious payloads.\n  - The report correctly notes this as a concern but considers it controlled.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0.2** (due to extension import).\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static analysis utility with no malicious behavior, reading files, analyzing, and reporting metrics.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or network activity.\n  - The only potential risk is extension importation, but no malicious extensions are present.\n  - The code uses standard safe practices.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static analysis tool with standard file handling, no malicious activity, but reliance on external modules which could be compromised.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The concern about external modules (`lizard_ext`, `lizard_languages`) is valid if those modules are untrusted.\n  - No evidence of malicious code within this script.\n  - The risk is primarily from external dependencies, not the code itself.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correct. Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0.1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on **0**; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports **0**; code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher where extension importation occurs, but overall very low.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code or payloads found)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is straightforward, well-documented)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (due to dynamic extension loading which could be exploited if untrusted modules are supplied)\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe code is a standard static analysis utility with no signs of malicious intent. The main security consideration is the extension system, which should be used with trusted modules. No network activity, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nEnsure extension modules are from trusted sources, and consider sandboxing or validating extension modules before import in security-sensitive environments.",
