  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Static analysis for code metrics, no malicious behavior.  \n- Sources/Sinks: Standard file I/O, dynamic extension import.  \n- Flows: Source reading → analysis → report.  \n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard practices.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is a static analysis tool, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.  \n- The dynamic import system could be exploited if malicious extensions are supplied, but this is a known plugin pattern, not inherently malicious.  \n- The report's logic is sound; no issues.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, considering extension import potential but not malicious) — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Similar static analysis, code metrics.  \n- Sources/Sinks: Reads files, generates reports.  \n- Flows: Input → analysis → report.  \n- Anomalies: No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.  \n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis aligns with the code’s purpose.  \n- No suspicious behaviors or security issues identified.  \n- High confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, standard static analysis) — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Static analysis with extension modules.  \n- Sources/Sinks: File reading, dynamic import of extensions based on user input.  \n- Flows: Source files → analysis → report.  \n- Anomalies: Dynamic import based on user input is a potential risk, as malicious extensions could be loaded.  \n- No network or system command execution observed.  \n- Conclusion: Potential concern due to extension import, but overall intended for code analysis.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The key security concern is the dynamic import of extensions via user-supplied strings, which could be exploited if malicious modules are supplied.  \n- However, the code does not execute untrusted code directly; it relies on extension modules.  \n- The risk is more about the extension supply chain than the code itself.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no direct malware, just extension loading)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (due to extension import potential) — acceptable but warrants noting.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Static analysis for code metrics.  \n- Sources/Sinks: Reads files, no network/system commands.  \n- Flows: Source code → analysis → report.  \n- Anomalies: No malicious code, no obfuscation, standard practices.  \n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is a typical static analysis utility.  \n- No malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (no security concerns) — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Static analysis for code complexity.  \n- Sources/Sinks: Reads source files, configuration files, extension modules.  \n- Flows: Input files → analysis → report.  \n- Anomalies: Use of dynamic extension loading, which could be exploited if malicious extensions are introduced.  \n- No network activity or system commands.  \n- Conclusion: Standard static analysis, with a note on extension security.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The main concern is the dynamic import of extensions based on user input, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if untrusted modules are supplied.  \n- The code itself does not contain malicious payloads.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malware detected)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1–0.2 (slightly higher due to extension import risk but not malicious) — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All correctly assign 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher in reports 3 and 5 due to the extension import pattern, which could be exploited if untrusted extensions are used. However, this is a known plugin pattern, not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Personal Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malware or malicious payloads observed.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, well-structured, and documented.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1–0.2** — mainly due to the extension import mechanism, which could be exploited if untrusted extensions are loaded. This is a common concern in plugin systems but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, but worth noting the extension loading pattern)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate open-source static analysis utility with no malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the extension import pattern, which should be managed carefully to prevent supply chain risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Ensure extension modules are validated or sandboxed if used in untrusted environments.",
