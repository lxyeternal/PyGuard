  "purpose": "This code is a Python-based cyclomatic complexity analyzer for multiple programming languages, designed to analyze source code files, generate reports, and identify code complexity issues.",
  "sources": "The code reads source files from specified paths, supports command-line argument inputs, and loads configuration files such as .gitignore and whitelist files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include reading external files (.gitignore, whitelist), and dynamic module imports based on user-supplied extension names. It also writes to output files and standard output.",
  "flows": "Input files are processed through get_all_source_files() with filtering via .gitignore and whitelist; data flows into source code analyzers, which generate tokens and parse code; results flow into report generation functions; user-configurable extensions may influence processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically loads modules based on user input, which could be exploited to import malicious code if untrusted extension names are supplied. The use of import_module with user-provided strings without validation presents a potential security risk. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious backdoors or obfuscated code are detected. Logging or warnings related to file operations could be manipulated if input files are malicious, but this is standard for file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive source code analysis tool that uses dynamic imports for extensions, processes source files with support for ignoring patterns, and generates various report formats. It handles user input via command-line arguments, supporting multiple languages and extensions, and includes mechanisms for filtering and whitelisting warnings. No evidence of malicious code such as system data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malware-like behavior is present. The dynamic module loading based on user input is a point of concern but is controlled by the extension list, which appears to be within the tool's scope. The script does not contain code that would send data over the network or modify system files outside of file I/O for report output.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a static source code analysis tool with flexible extension support and report generation capabilities. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or malware characteristics. The only potential security concern is the dynamic import of extensions based on user input, which should be validated or restricted to safe modules to prevent arbitrary code execution.",
