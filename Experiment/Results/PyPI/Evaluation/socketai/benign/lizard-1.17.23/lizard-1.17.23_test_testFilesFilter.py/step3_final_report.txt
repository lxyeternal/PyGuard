{
  "purpose": "The code is a suite of unit tests for the get_all_source_files function from the lizard module, verifying file discovery, filtering, exclusion, and handling of duplicates and ignore rules.",
  "sources": "Filesystem interactions via os.walk, os.path functions, and file reading through mock open calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network or system modification activities.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data read and filtering logic; no malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of controlled, mocked filesystem interactions and file content reads used for testing. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The tests verify filtering logic, exclusion patterns, duplicate detection, and .gitignore handling. All signals indicate benign, standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
