  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'lizard' package, managing installation, versioning, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads CHANGELOG.md for version info; reads and modifies version.py; reads README.rst; environment variables indirectly via file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to version.py file; reads files for versioning and description.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from CHANGELOG.md and version.py; writes updated version to version.py; loads package info from setup()",
  "anomalies": "Uses a broad try-except block that suppresses all exceptions; no explicit malicious code, but the exception handling could mask issues. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard setup tasks: reading version info, updating version.py, and configuring package metadata. The try-except block broadly catches exceptions, which can hide errors but is common in setup scripts. No external network activity, no data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent. No indicators of malware, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present. The broad exception handling could mask errors but does not constitute malicious activity.",
