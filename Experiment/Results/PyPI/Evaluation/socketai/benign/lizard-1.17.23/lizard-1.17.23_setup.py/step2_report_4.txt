  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The script is a standard `setup.py` for a Python package.\n- It reads the latest version from `CHANGELOG.md`.\n- It updates a version file `lizard_ext/version.py`.\n- It defines package metadata and a custom command to display the version.\n- Uses broad exception handling (`try/except:`) around version extraction and update logic.\n- No network activity, no code obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious external calls.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Setup script for 'lizard', version management.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code; broad except hides errors but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (low, due to broad exception handling).\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No malicious activity detected. The low risk score is justified due to exception handling hiding errors but not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with emphasis on reading files and updating version.\n- **Analysis:** No external network calls or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No malware or obfuscation, and minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup with version extraction and display.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. Slightly higher risk score due to broad exception handling, but still low.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as previous, with focus on potential error masking.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; broad exception handling is noted.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup, managing version info.\n- **Analysis:** No network activity, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code. The code is a typical setup script.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated due to broad exception handling, which can hide errors but doesn't pose a security threat.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.\n- The broad exception handling, while common in setup scripts, could be improved for error transparency but does not introduce security risks.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** (due to broad exception handling that could mask errors, but no real security risk)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided scores.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-understood setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk scores are appropriately low, primarily due to exception handling practices, which are common but could be improved for better error reporting. No further security concerns are identified.",
