  "purpose": "Setup script for the lizard package to automate installation, versioning, and command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'CHANGELOG.md' to determine version; reads and writes to 'lizard_ext/version.py'; reads 'README.rst'; accesses package metadata.",
  "sinks": "File operations for reading/writing version info; printing version information.",
  "flows": "Extracts version info from changelog -> updates version.py -> displays version when command is run.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious file manipulations detected. The code properly handles versioning and setup without suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info from a markdown changelog, updates a version Python file, and provides setup metadata. It does not execute untrusted input or perform network operations. The only potential concern could be the broad exception handling that might mask errors, but this is common in setup scripts. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for a Python package, with proper version management. No malicious activity or security risks are apparent based on the provided code.",
