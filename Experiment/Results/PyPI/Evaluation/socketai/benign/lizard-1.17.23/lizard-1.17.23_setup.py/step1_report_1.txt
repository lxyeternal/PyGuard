  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'lizard' Python package, used for installation and version management.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'CHANGELOG.md' file for version extraction, reads and writes 'lizard_ext/version.py' for version updates, reads 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Writes to 'lizard_ext/version.py' to store version info.",
  "flows": "Reads changelog and README files as input; writes updated version to 'lizard_ext/version.py'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; uses broad except clause which might hide errors, but does not appear malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages versioning information and package setup details. It reads a changelog to determine the latest version, updates the version file, and defines setup parameters. The broad exception handling could hide issues but does not introduce malicious behavior. No code injection, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script with version management and package configuration. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected. The use of broad exception handling is a potential concern but not malicious.",
