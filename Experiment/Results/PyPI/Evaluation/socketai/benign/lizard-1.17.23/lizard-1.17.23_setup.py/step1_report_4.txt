  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and installing the 'lizard' Python code analysis tool.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'CHANGELOG.md', reading and writing 'version.py', reading 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'lizard_ext/version.py'.",
  "flows": "Reading changelog -> setting version -> updating version.py -> displaying version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling (except:) that suppresses all errors, including potential critical failures. No suspicious network activity or code injection observed. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: extracting version info from a markdown file, updating a version file, and defining setup configuration. It includes a custom command to display version info. No external data sources or sinks are exploited for malicious purposes. Exception handling is overly broad, which could hide errors but not malicious activity. No indications of malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup file for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard package setup operations safely. The broad exception handling warrants attention but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
