  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code manages version extraction from 'CHANGELOG.md', updates 'lizard_ext/version.py', and has no suspicious code or external calls.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the findings.\n- **Comments:** The broad except could hide errors but isn't malicious. No obfuscation or malware detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on reading and updating version info, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Comments:** No malicious behavior, just standard setup logic.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—reading version info, updating files, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No external network activity or malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Reiterates standard setup tasks, with the same broad exception handling.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Comments:** No malicious activity, just cautious exception handling.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, standard setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Comments:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports confirm that the code is a typical setup script for a Python package. It reads version info from markdown files, updates a version Python file, and defines setup parameters. No suspicious external calls, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.\n  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n- **Security Risks:** The only minor concern is the broad exception handling (`except:`), which could mask errors but does not introduce malicious behavior. The risk score of around 0.1-0.2 is appropriate.\n\n- **Potential Assumptions & Claims:** No report claims or implies any vulnerabilities beyond standard setup issues. All assessments are cautious and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I concur with the provided scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1-0.2 (minor concern about broad exception handling, but not malicious)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to broad exception handling, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup script is standard, safe, and does not pose any supply chain security threat. The reported scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
