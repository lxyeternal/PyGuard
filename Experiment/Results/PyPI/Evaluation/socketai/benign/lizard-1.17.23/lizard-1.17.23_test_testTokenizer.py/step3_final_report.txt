  "purpose": "Unit tests for the generate_tokens function from lizard_languages.code_reader, verifying tokenization of various code constructs.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded input strings within test cases, including code snippets, comments, strings, macros, and whitespace.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code is static and does not process external input.",
  "flows": "Input strings are tokenized by generate_tokens; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for tokenization, covering multiple language constructs. It contains no network activity, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. The code is static, well-structured, and designed solely for correctness verification. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit test suite for tokenization, with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the static, benign nature of the code.",
