{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for a C++/Python code statement counter extension, validating the correct counting of code statements in functions across different languages and control structures.",
  "sources": "Reading of code strings within test cases, including function definitions and control structures.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leakage points are present; the code solely processes static strings for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "Input code strings -> statement counting functions -> assertions verifying statement counts.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code constructs observed. The code consists entirely of benign test cases and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward unit testing for a statement counting extension, with no external inputs, no network or file operations, and no data transformations that could be malicious. All code appears to be static test data with assertions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments are present. The code’s purpose is to validate functionality, not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite designed to validate a statement counting extension. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks. It operates solely on static test data to ensure correct functionality.",
