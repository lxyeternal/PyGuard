  "purpose": "Unit tests for measuring statement counts in C++ and Python functions using a custom extension.",
  "sources": "Code reads static source code strings defined within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks; test functions operate on static code snippets.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving external input; all data is hardcoded within the tests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior; code appears straightforward for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of structured unit tests utilizing the unittest framework to verify a statement counting extension for C++ and Python code snippets. It defines multiple test cases, each providing static source code strings representing functions with various control flow structures, to assess the correctness of statement counting. The code uses helper functions to process these snippets but does not include any external data input, network communication, or code execution beyond the test environment. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious code injections. The code is consistent, well-structured, and aimed solely at testing a specific functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for a statement counting extension; it contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates on static, hardcoded source code snippets for validation purposes only. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
