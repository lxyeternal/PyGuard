{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for a statement counting extension, designed to verify the correctness of statement counts in C++ and Python code snippets.",
  "sources": "Static string code snippets within test functions, no external inputs or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; the code does not process or output sensitive information.",
  "flows": "The test code calls functions to analyze static code snippets; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static test code with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It tests a statement counting extension with various control structures, all within a controlled environment. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is clear, and it does not perform any network activity or data leakage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static unit test suite for a statement counting extension. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate and accurate.",
