{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for a C++/Python statement counting extension used for code analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input code snippets as string literals within test cases.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks or untrusted data handling in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the string code snippets into the function get_cpp_function_list_with_extension or get_python_function_list_with_extension, which process and analyze the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard unit test code with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for a statement counting extension, designed to evaluate the statement count in provided code snippets for C++ and Python. The snippets are simple and static, used to verify correctness. No external inputs, environment variables, or network communications are involved. The code structure is typical of test cases, with no suspicious logic, obfuscated parts, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code. It is a benign test suite intended for validation of a code analysis tool.",
