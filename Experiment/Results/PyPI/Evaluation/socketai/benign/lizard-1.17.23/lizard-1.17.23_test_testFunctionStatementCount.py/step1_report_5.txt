  "purpose": "Unit tests for code counting extension, assessing statement counting accuracy across C++ and Python code snippets.",
  "sources": "Code strings within test functions, input to get_*_with_extension functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; code only processes static code snippets.",
  "flows": "Input code passed directly to functions; no data flow from external sources or untrusted input to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward testing logic with no hidden or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of structured unit tests for a statement counting extension, using predefined code snippets for C++ and Python. It validates the correctness of statement counts for various control structures and functions. No external data sources, network calls, or environmental variables are used. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious activities. The code appears standard and solely for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying statement counting logic. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe, straightforward, and intended for development/testing purposes.",
