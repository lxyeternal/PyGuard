  "sources": "importlib.import_module, get_extensions, FileInformation, FunctionInfo, lizard_ext.lizardio.LizardExtension, FileAnalyzer, OutputScheme",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Importing modules and patching mock objects; creating extensions; analyzing source code; setting properties; invoking extension methods; assertions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Usage of mock objects and patching is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a suite of unit tests for a Python project involving extensions, source code analysis, and properties. It utilizes mock objects and patching for testing extension import mechanisms and analysis features. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present; the code appears to be for testing purposes only. No external data flows or data exfiltration points are found. The focus is on functionality verification, not on malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests designed to verify extension handling and source code analysis features. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and normal for its intended testing purpose.",
