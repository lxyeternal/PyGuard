{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite for the lizard_ext.html_output function, verifying that HTML output contains an HTML body tag.",
  "sources": "parse_args, html_output, sys.stdout.stream",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.stream (output to stdout)",
  "flows": "html_output generates output to sys.stdout.stream which is checked with a regex",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external connections or hidden behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing modules and mocks, sets up a test case with sample FunctionInfo and FileInformation objects, and calls html_output to produce output checked for an HTML tag. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious external interactions. Usage of mocks and standard library functions indicates typical testing practice. No anomalous or potentially malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test for HTML output, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected testing operations without suspicious activity.",
