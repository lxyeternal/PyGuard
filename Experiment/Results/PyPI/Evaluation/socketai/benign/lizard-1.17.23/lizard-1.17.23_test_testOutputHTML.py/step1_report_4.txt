  "purpose": "Unit testing the HTML output functionality of the lizard extension module",
  "sources": "parse_args() function, Mock object, sys.stdout.stream",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.stream (printing output), no other data sinks identified",
  "flows": "parse_args() provides options, html_output() generates HTML and writes to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected; use of 'Mock' is standard for testing",
  "analysis": "The code imports test utilities and modules, sets up a test class for verifying HTML output, and checks that the output contains an HTML tag. The code uses standard mocking and parsing functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or data leaks. The use of sys.stdout.stream in tests is typical for capturing output. No suspicious external connections, data exfiltration, or code injection behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward unit test for output rendering with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks. The code appears safe and solely for testing purposes.",
