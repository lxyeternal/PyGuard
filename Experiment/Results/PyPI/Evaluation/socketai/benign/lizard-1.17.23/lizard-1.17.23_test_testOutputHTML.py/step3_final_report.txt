  "sources": "parse_args, FunctionInfo, FileInformation, html_output, sys.stdout.stream",

  "flows": "html_output generates output to sys.stdout.stream, which is checked for <html> tag",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test that sets up mock data and verifies the presence of an <html> tag in the output. It uses common testing libraries and practices. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code is clear, readable, and performs a simple output check. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent are detected. The test's purpose is benign, and the code structure is typical for such tests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
