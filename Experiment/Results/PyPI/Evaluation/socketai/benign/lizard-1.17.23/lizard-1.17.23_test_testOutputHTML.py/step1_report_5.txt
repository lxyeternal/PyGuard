  "purpose": "Unit testing for HTML output generation in the lizard_ext module, verifying that HTML body is correctly produced.",
  "sources": "parse_args() function, FunctionInfo constructor, FileInformation constructor, Mock() object, html_output() function",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.stream (output stream for HTML content)",
  "flows": "html_output() writes HTML content to sys.stdout.stream based on file summaries and options",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of mock objects is standard in testing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and mocks, sets up test data structures for functions and files, and invokes html_output() to produce HTML output, asserting that the output contains <html> tags. All operations are standard for a test suite with no signs of malicious behavior. No untrusted input handling or dangerous code flows are present. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test for HTML rendering.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test code for verifying HTML output generation, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It uses common testing patterns and does not contain any security risks.",
