  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Verification Against Issues Reported:**\n   - The code is a unit test suite for the `html_output` function from `lizard_ext`.\n   - It sets up mock data (`FunctionInfo`, `FileInformation`) and verifies that the output contains an `<html>` tag.\n   - The code uses standard testing practices: mocks, assertions, and output capturing.\n   - No external data leaks, no code obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no hardcoded secrets are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent; all conclude that the code is a straightforward, benign unit test.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0.1 or 0).\n   - These seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No changes are necessary; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score is 0.1, which is justified because:\n     - The code is a test suite, not production code.\n     - No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - No higher risk scores are warranted here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they only analyze the code as-is.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a benign test.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final System Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, justified by the benign nature of the test code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a simple, standard unit test with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
