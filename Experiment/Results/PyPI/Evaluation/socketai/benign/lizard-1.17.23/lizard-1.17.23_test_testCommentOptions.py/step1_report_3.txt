  "purpose": "Unit tests for C++ function list extraction based on comment options",
  "sources": "Import statements, get_cpp_function_list function calls with code snippets",
  "sinks": "Assertions checking lengths of function lists",
  "flows": "Input code snippets passed to get_cpp_function_list, results evaluated in assertions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no external network calls or system modifications observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests using the unittest framework. It imports mock libraries and a helper function to parse C++ code snippets. The tests verify whether functions are correctly identified or ignored based on comments indicating forgiveness or generated code. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code appears straightforward, focused on testing parsing logic, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of unit tests for a code parsing function. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or suspicious anomalies.",
