  "purpose": "Unit tests for the function get_cpp_function_list, verifying parsing of C++ code snippets with specific comment markers.",
  "sources": "Static string inputs representing C++ code snippets with comments and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by get_cpp_function_list; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite that checks how specific comments influence function recognition in C++ code snippets. It involves no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The comments serve as markers for parser behavior, not as malicious triggers. The code relies on standard testing libraries and a helper function, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The provided tests are deterministic and solely for verifying parsing logic. No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite for a C++ parser function, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned scores are justified and should remain at zero.",
