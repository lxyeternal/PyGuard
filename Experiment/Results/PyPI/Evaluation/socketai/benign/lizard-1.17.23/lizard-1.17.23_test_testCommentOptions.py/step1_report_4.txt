  "purpose": "Unit testing for C++ function parsing based on comment options and generated code markers.",
  "sources": "get_cpp_function_list function call, input strings for parsing C++ code snippets.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or external data handling; the code is for testing purposes only.",
  "flows": "Input strings (source) are processed by get_cpp_function_list to identify functions, with no data leaving or affecting external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code appears straightforward and typical for unit tests.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing and mocking modules, defines a test class with multiple test methods that evaluate the parsing function get_cpp_function_list. The tests focus on detecting comments that influence parsing behavior and ignore generated code markers. There are no signs of malicious activity, suspicious code, or obfuscation. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard unit test suite aimed at verifying C++ function parsing logic related to comment directives. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
