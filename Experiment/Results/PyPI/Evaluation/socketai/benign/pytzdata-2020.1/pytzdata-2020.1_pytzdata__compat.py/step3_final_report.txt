  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Version check leads to assignment of exception class.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version check and assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple runtime check of Python version and assigns FileNotFoundError accordingly, ensuring compatibility between Python 3.3+ and earlier versions. It involves no external data, no I/O, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The pattern is standard and well-understood, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility pattern with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify it as such, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
