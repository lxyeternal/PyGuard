  "purpose": "Defines compatibility for FileNotFoundError exception across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version information from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Uses sys.version_info to determine exception class; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; standard compatibility shim.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python runtime version to define the exception class for FileNotFoundError for compatibility with older Python versions. It imports sys, assesses sys.version_info, and conditionally assigns the exception class. There is no malicious behavior, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity present. The code is straightforward and serves a version compatibility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple compatibility check for exception handling across Python versions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
