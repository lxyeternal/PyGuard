  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\nThe code is a typical compatibility shim for defining `FileNotFoundError` across different Python versions. It checks the Python version and assigns `FileNotFoundError` accordingly, ensuring compatibility with Python versions before and after 3.3. There are no data flows, no external inputs, no outputs, and no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a compatibility shim for exception handling, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 (correct)\n  - securityRisk: 0 (correct)\n  - obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - confidence: 1 (appropriate)\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's intent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, emphasizing the compatibility purpose. No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code's purpose. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate. No malicious activity, straightforward version check.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - confidence: 1.0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, standard compatibility pattern.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are there any signs of malware or malicious intent?** No. The code is a simple version check and exception aliasing.\n- **Is there any obfuscation?** No.\n- **Are the scores unreasonable?** All reports correctly assign zero to malware and security risk, with high confidence.\n- **Any assumptions challenged?** The reports assume the code is benign, which is accurate.\n- **Are the scores consistent?** Yes.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimations:\nGiven the nature of the code, I agree with the reports' assessments. The malware score should be **0**, obfuscated **0**, and risk **0**.\n\n**However, considering the importance of cautious security assessment, I would assign the following:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**These are consistent with the code's benign nature.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward compatibility shim.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present.\n- The scores given in all reports are appropriate and should not be changed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** Confirm all scores as zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, with high confidence.",
