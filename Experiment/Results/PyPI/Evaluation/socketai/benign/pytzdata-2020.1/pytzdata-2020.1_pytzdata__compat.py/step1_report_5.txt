  "purpose": "Defines compatibility for FileNotFoundError exception between Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "None that directly lead to data leaks or security issues",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets exception class compatibility",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version using sys.version_info. If the version is 3.3 or higher, it assigns FileNotFoundError to itself; otherwise, it assigns IOError to maintain compatibility. This is a standard compatibility pattern and contains no malicious intent or risky behavior. No external input, no data leakage, no suspicious network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for exception handling across Python versions and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
