  "purpose": "The code defines a compatibility layer for handling FileNotFoundError exceptions across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version information from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to defining a variable based on the Python version, with no data or input flow beyond that.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard compatibility code for supporting multiple Python versions.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version to determine whether to assign FileNotFoundError to itself or to IOError, ensuring compatibility with older Python versions. No external data inputs, no execution of untrusted code, and no malicious behavior are present. The code serves a simple compatibility purpose and uses standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward compatibility shim with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
