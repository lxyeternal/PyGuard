  "purpose": "The code is defining compatibility for the FileNotFoundError exception across Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output data based on untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The code reassigns the FileNotFoundError exception for compatibility purposes, which is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version and assigns FileNotFoundError accordingly, ensuring compatibility between Python versions 3.3+ and earlier. This pattern is typical for maintaining cross-version compatibility and does not involve any data processing, input handling, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward compatibility shim for exception handling across Python versions. There are no malicious or suspicious elements present.",
