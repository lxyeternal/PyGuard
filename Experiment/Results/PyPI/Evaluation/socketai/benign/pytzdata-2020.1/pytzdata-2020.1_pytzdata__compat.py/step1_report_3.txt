  "purpose": "Define compatibility for FileNotFoundError exception based on Python version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Access to sys.version_info to determine Python version; conditional assignment of exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected; straightforward compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version using sys.version_info and assigns the name FileNotFoundError accordingly for compatibility with older Python versions. This is standard practice for maintaining compatibility and involves no malicious or malicious-looking constructs. No hardcoded credentials, data leakage, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. It is a simple version check and class aliasing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim for exception handling across Python versions. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
