  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the same code snippet: a compatibility shim for `FileNotFoundError` across Python versions. The code checks `sys.version_info` and assigns `FileNotFoundError` accordingly, which is a common pattern for maintaining compatibility with older Python versions.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, external input, or output.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network/file operations are present.  \n- No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident.  \n- The logic is standard and well-understood in cross-version compatibility contexts.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n- The code correctly checks the Python version and assigns the exception class accordingly.  \n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.  \n- The pattern is typical for such compatibility layers.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n- The security risk scores are 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.  \n- Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential for Misinterpretation or Assumptions**  \n- The reports are consistent and do not make unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.  \n- They correctly identify the code as a standard compatibility pattern.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \n- The code is a benign, standard compatibility shim.  \n- There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.  \n- The confidence should stay at 1, given the clarity and simplicity of the code.  \n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain report correctly identifies the code as a harmless compatibility pattern with no malicious or security concerns. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no further action is needed.",
