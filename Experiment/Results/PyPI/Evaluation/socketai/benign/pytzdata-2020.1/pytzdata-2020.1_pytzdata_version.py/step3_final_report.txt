  "purpose": "Static version declaration with version strings for package metadata.",
  "sources": "Assignment of VERSION and OLSON_VERSION string variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external data input/output.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is static.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs; straightforward static assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two string assignments defining version identifiers. No imports, functions, data processing, or external interactions are present. The code is static, simple, and serves as metadata. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as version metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
