  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is purely defining string constants for versioning purposes. There are no dynamic behaviors, no input/output, no functions, and no suspicious constructs. The code is benign and serves as metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity. No logical flaws are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   - `malware`: 0  \n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   - `confidence`: 1  \n\n   These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. Since there is no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation, these scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all assessments assign a `securityRisk` of 0, there's no need to justify higher scores. The code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports assign `malware` as 0, which is correct. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as version declarations without any suspicious activity.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct; no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct; no security risk)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the assessments. There is no indication of hidden malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a straightforward version declaration with no security concerns. All scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
