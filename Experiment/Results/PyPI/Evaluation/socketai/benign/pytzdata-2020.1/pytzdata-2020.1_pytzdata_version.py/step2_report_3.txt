  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only contains static string assignments for version identifiers.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code, input/output, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n   - The code is benign and purely metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident. They correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary unless new context suggests otherwise.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores as 0, which is justified.\n   - Since there's no malicious activity or obfuscation, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward version declaration.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- Security risk is negligible.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign with no security concerns.",
