  "purpose": "Define version constants for a software package or module",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static assignment of version strings",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow; just static variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two string assignments defining version information. There are no functions, data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code is straightforward and typical for version declaration in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious or security concern indications. It is benign and standard in nature.",
