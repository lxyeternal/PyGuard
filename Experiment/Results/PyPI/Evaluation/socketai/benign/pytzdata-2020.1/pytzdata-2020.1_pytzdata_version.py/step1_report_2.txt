  "sinks": "No sink points or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as no processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only defining string constants with version numbers. No suspicious or unusual code structures or behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains two string assignments for version identifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, no input/output operations, no suspicious constructs, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The content appears standard for version declaration in a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to declare version information with no malicious intent or security risks.",
