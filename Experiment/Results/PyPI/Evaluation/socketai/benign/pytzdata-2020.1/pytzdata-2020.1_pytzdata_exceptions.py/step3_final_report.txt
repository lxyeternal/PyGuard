  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'TimezoneNotFound' inheriting from a locally imported 'FileNotFoundError' for handling timezone-related errors.",
  "sources": "Import from '._compat' module, class definition",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external output",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definition with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class inheritance, no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'FileNotFoundError' from a local module '._compat' and defines an empty subclass 'TimezoneNotFound'. It serves as a specific exception for timezone errors. The code is minimal, with no dynamic behavior, external communication, or suspicious constructs. The import from '._compat' is typical for compatibility purposes. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The class is purely structural, intended for error handling within a larger codebase. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are accurate and should remain as is.",
