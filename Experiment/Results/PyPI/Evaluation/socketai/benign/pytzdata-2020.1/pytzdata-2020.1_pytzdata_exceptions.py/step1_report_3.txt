{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'TimezoneNotFound' that inherits from 'FileNotFoundError'.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'FileNotFoundError' from a local module '._compat'.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; no sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward class inheritance with no suspicious or unusual behavior. Importing from a local module '_compat' is typical for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class and defining a new subclass that doesn't add any new behavior. No input handling, data processing, or output occurs. No obfuscated code, secrets, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class definition intended for exception handling. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
