  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Issue Presence in Code**: All reports describe a straightforward class definition that matches the provided code. The code only defines a custom exception inheriting from a locally imported `FileNotFoundError`. There are no signs of malicious activity, data flow, or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**: No logical errors or mistakes are evident. The code is minimal and standard, with proper class inheritance. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n3. **Score Reasonableness**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Risk Score Justification**:\n   - The code is purely structural, defining an exception class with no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external communication.\n   - No vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious intent are indicated.\n   - The purpose appears to be to facilitate specific error handling within a larger codebase.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores**:\n   - Both scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are unwarranted.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and match the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, benign exception class definition with no security issues or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nNo changes needed.",
