{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'TimezoneNotFound' that inherits from 'FileNotFoundError' for handling timezone-related errors.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'FileNotFoundError' from a local module named '._compat'. No input or data reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present in this code; it solely defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard exception class from a local compatibility module and creates a subclass for specific error handling. It appears to serve as part of a larger codebase to handle timezone errors. No malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic or suspicious features suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward class definition intended for custom exception handling related to timezone errors. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
