  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'TimezoneNotFound' inheriting from FileNotFoundError.",
  "sources": "Imports FileNotFoundError from a local module ._compat.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard exception class from a local compatibility module, then defines a subclass 'TimezoneNotFound' for specific exception handling related to missing time zone data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious constructs. The class is empty, serving as a custom exception. No external data handling, code injection, or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project and is purely structural.",
