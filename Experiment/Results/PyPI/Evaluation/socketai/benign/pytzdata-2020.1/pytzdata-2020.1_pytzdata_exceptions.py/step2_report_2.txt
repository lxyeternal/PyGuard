  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a simple class definition that inherits from a locally imported `FileNotFoundError`.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or network activity is present.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward custom exception class for handling timezone-related errors.\n- The import from `_compat` suggests an attempt at compatibility across environments, which is common and benign.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1 (high confidence in benign nature)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\nThese scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues are present; the code is benign.\n- The reports are consistent in their reasoning and conclusions.\n- No need to adjust scores.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The assumption that this is a benign exception class is justified.\n- No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is indicated.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign exception class definition. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- Confirm that the code is benign and serves a straightforward purpose within the larger codebase.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis supply chain component appears safe, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.",
