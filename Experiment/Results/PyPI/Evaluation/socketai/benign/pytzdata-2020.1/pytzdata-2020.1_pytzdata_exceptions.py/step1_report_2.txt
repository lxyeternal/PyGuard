{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'TimezoneNotFound' that inherits from a compatibilty-based 'FileNotFoundError'.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '_compat' and the class definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definition does not process input or data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially compatible version of 'FileNotFoundError' from a local module '_compat'. It then defines a custom exception class 'TimezoneNotFound' that inherits from this imported error class. The class contains no additional methods or attributes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or obfuscated code. The code is simple, standard, and appears to serve as a specialized exception for timezone-related errors within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign class definition for a custom exception. There is no indication of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward utility component within a larger application.",
