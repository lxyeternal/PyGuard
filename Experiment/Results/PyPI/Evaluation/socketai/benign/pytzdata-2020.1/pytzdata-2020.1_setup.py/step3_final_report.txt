  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and data files for pytzdata.",
  "sources": "Static data definitions for packages and package_data, no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting system security.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only executes static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It only defines static package information and data files, with no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The package data includes timezone files, which are standard for this library. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the static, straightforward nature of the code.",
