  "purpose": "This code snippet serves solely as a character encoding declaration in a Python source file.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a minimal encoding declaration (`# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`) with no executable code, data sources, sinks, or flows. It is a standard practice to specify encoding in Python files. The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the content. No logical flaws or errors are present, and the assessment aligns with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, containing only a standard encoding declaration. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.",
