  "purpose": "The code only contains a UTF-8 encoding declaration and no executable statements or logic.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows as there are no executable elements.",
  "anomalies": "The code lacks any functional content; it is merely a file encoding declaration with no logic, inputs, or outputs.",
  "analysis": "This file is essentially empty aside from specifying the file encoding. There are no variables, functions, imports, or any operational code. Because there is no code to analyze beyond the encoding declaration, there are no security issues, suspicious behaviors, or malicious indicators present. The file appears to be a placeholder or a minimal header.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no executable logic, data handling, or potential security risks. It is a benign and empty file solely specifying the encoding format.",
