{
  "purpose": "The code defines a tuple containing a list of timezone strings, likely for use in timezone management or configuration.",
  "sources": "The source is a hardcoded list of timezone identifiers stored as a tuple at the beginning of the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or use untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling occurs in this code; it is purely static data definition.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an extensive list of timezone strings, including some redundant or outdated entries (e.g., 'Asia/Calcutta' and 'Asia/Kolkata' are absent, but others like 'Asia/Colombo' are present). No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present. There are no functions, classes, or runtime behaviors to analyze.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static data structure holding timezone identifiers, used for referencing or configuration purposes. It lacks functions, control flow, or dynamic operations. No suspicious or malicious code elements are present. The only noteworthy aspect is the comprehensive nature of the list, which appears manually curated but does not indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static list of timezone strings with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve as a configuration resource or reference list within a larger application. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
