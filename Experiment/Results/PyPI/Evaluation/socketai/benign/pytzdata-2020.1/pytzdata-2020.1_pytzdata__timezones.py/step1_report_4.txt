  "purpose": "Defines a tuple of string literals representing various timezones and timezone identifiers.",
  "sources": "Data source is the static assignment of a large tuple of timezone strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the data is statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of a static tuple of timezone strings. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or sensitive data processing is present. It does not contain obfuscation, network communication, or backdoors. The structure is straightforward and standard for a predefined list of constants.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple static list of timezone strings with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to serve as a resource for timezone data within a larger application.",
