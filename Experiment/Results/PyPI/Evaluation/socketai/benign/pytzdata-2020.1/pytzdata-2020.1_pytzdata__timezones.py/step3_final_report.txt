  "purpose": "Static list of timezone strings used as a resource within an application.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded timezone string literals within the tuple.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; static data used internally.",
  "flows": "N/A – static data; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward data declaration with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a large static tuple of timezone strings. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, input/output handling, or network activity. The data appears to be manually curated timezone identifiers, some of which may be outdated or redundant, but this does not impact security. The absence of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code indicates no malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. All reports correctly identify the code as a static resource with no security concerns. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static list of timezone strings with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses no security risk. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
