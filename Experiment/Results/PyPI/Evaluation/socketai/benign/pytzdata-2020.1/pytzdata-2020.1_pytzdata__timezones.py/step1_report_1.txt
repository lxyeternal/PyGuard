  "purpose": "Defines a tuple containing a list of timezone strings, likely for use in timezone management within an application.",
  "sources": "The data source is a static tuple of timezone strings hardcoded into the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are present; no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist involving untrusted input; the code is a static data declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The script solely contains a large tuple of timezone strings, which are static and predefined. There are no functions, no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no use of environment variables, and no network activity. The code appears to be a simple, static data structure with no malicious intent or behavior. The presence of extensive timezone data does not indicate obfuscation or malicious code. No malicious or suspicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static declaration of timezone strings with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It serves as a dataset for timezone information and does not perform any harmful actions.",
