  "purpose": "Defines a tuple of timezone strings, likely for use in timezone conversions or selections.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static list of timezone strings assigned to the variable 'timezones'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external input handling; no sinks for data leakage or malicious actions present.",
  "flows": "The code simply assigns a static tuple to a variable without any flow of untrusted data or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. The list appears to be a comprehensive, static set of timezone identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a static tuple of timezone names, likely for reference or configuration. There are no functions, input/output operations, or external dependencies. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The list appears to be a standard, comprehensive set of timezone strings, including common and some alias names. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a static list of timezone strings with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a benign configuration/data structure. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
