  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate timezone data management script with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs expected operations without obfuscation or malicious behavior. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified given the external dependencies and subprocess execution, which are standard in build automation. No modifications to the scores are necessary."
