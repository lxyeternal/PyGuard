  "purpose": "Helper class for constructing and managing HTTP headers for a web server, specifically designed for aiohttp server configuration.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; internal configuration via class methods and properties.",
  "sinks": "Headers are set and removed within the class; potential external effect when apply() modifies aiohttp.HTTP_HEADERS.",
  "flows": "No external untrusted data flows into header settings; headers are managed internally and applied to the aiohttp backend.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The class manages HTTP headers with options to enable or disable specific security-related headers. The shared_array_buffer property toggles security headers related to cross-origin policies. The set_header and remove_header methods modify internal dictionaries, which are then applied to the aiohttp backend. The code uses standard Python idioms and does not process untrusted input or execute dynamic code. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks beyond normal header management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign helper for HTTP header configuration with no malicious intent. It manages headers appropriately for security purposes and does not contain malware or obfuscated code. Overall security risk is very low.",
