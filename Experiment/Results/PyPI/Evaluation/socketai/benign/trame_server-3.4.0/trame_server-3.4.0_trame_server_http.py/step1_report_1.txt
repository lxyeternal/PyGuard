  "purpose": "Helper class to construct and manage HTTP headers for a web server, primarily using aiohttp.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; code reads no external input but manages internal header data and conditional settings.",
  "sinks": "Setting headers via set_header method; potentially affects HTTP responses sent to clients.",
  "flows": "Headers are set or removed based on shared_array_buffer property; headers are ultimately applied to aiohttp server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns detected. The class conditionally sets security-related headers, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The class defines methods to set, remove, and retrieve HTTP headers, with a specific toggle for shared array buffer support that influences security headers. No external input is processed; the code is straightforward and appears to be for configuration purposes only. The 'apply' method updates a global aiohttp header store, which is typical in server setup. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code could potentially influence security posture through header configuration but does not contain malicious actions or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign helper class for HTTP header management, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It correctly manages headers related to security policies but does not perform any harmful actions.",
