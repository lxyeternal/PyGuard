  "purpose": "Manage and toggle HTTP security headers for an aiohttp web server, specifically handling cross-origin policies and shared array buffer support.",
  "sources": "Internal class properties and methods that set or remove headers; no external input processed.",
  "sinks": "Headers are applied globally via the aiohttp module; no direct data sinks or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "Setting 'shared_array_buffer' property triggers header modifications; 'apply()' updates global headers in aiohttp.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for server configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class for managing HTTP headers, toggling security-related headers based on an internal boolean property. It sets headers like 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy', 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy', and 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'. The 'apply()' method imports a module and assigns headers globally. No external input, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The only notable aspect is the permissive CORS header ('*'), which can be a security concern but is common in development or open APIs. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to standard practices, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing HTTP headers, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is the permissive CORS policy, which is a configuration choice rather than a flaw. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the CORS setting. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
