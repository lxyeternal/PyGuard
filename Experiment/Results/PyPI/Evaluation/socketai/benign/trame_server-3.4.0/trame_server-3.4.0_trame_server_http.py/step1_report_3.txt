{
  "purpose": "A helper class to construct and manage HTTP headers for a web server, specifically for aiohttp backend configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration inputs via property setters and method calls (e.g., shared_array_buffer property, set_header method).",
  "sinks": "The apply() method writes headers to the aiohttp backend (aiohttp.HTTP_HEADERS), potentially affecting server behavior.",
  "flows": "Input via property setters modifies internal header dictionary; get_header retrieves data; apply() pushes headers to external aiohttp module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code sets headers based on a boolean toggle with standard headers.",
  "analysis": "The class manages HTTP headers, allowing toggling of cross-origin policies and other headers based on a shared_array_buffer flag. No malicious or suspicious code is present. It relies on standard Python data structures and methods, with a straightforward flow from input to header configuration. The apply() method imports a specific module and assigns headers, which is standard for configuring server headers. There are no indications of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign header management utility for aiohttp servers. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. The logic is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
