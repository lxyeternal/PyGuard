  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing HTTP headers, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is the permissive CORS policy, which is a configuration choice rather than a flaw. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the CORS setting. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
