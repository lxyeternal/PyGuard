{
  "purpose": "This code provides a helper class for constructing and managing HTTP headers for a web server, specifically designed for use with aiohttp.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from internal variables (_headers, _presets) and user-set header values via set_header and shared_array_buffer setter.",
  "sinks": "Headers are stored in a dictionary and ultimately applied to an external module (aiohttp.HTTP_HEADERS).",
  "flows": "Headers set via set_header or shared_array_buffer property flow into the _headers dictionary, then are applied to aiohttp.HTTP_HEADERS via the apply() method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and does not contain obfuscated, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The class manages HTTP headers with typical getter/setter methods, and toggles certain security-related headers (like Cross-Origin policies) based on a preset. No untrusted input is processed directly; headers are set via method calls. The apply() method dynamically imports an internal module and assigns headers, which is standard. No suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The code does not perform any network operations or handle sensitive data. It mainly configures headers for security policies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign helper class for managing HTTP headers, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It does not handle user input directly in a dangerous manner, nor does it include malicious code. The only external effect is configuring headers for a web server, which is safe.",
