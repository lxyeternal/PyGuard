The primary concern is the execution of external or reloaded callbacks, which is inherent in such frameworks but not malicious per se. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the static analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing HTTP headers, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is the permissive CORS policy, which is a configuration choice rather than a flaw. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the CORS setting. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."

The risk is moderate (score 0.2), primarily due to potential misuse if untrusted functions are registered. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate WebSocket server implementation with no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The main security considerations are the use of a default insecure token and the potential for misuse of dynamic method registration and function execution via RPC. These issues should be addressed in deployment by changing default credentials and validating functions invoked through RPC. Overall, the code is safe but requires standard security best practices."

The small security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified as a precaution for potential sensitive data leakage, but overall, the code is safe."
