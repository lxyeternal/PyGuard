{
  "purpose": "The code reads and prints the content of a file named 'banner.txt' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file '__file__' (the current script file) to locate 'banner.txt' and reads its text content.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs the file content to standard output.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the script's file path (__file__), modifies it to find 'banner.txt', reads its content, and then prints it.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib, defines a function 'print_banner' that ignores its parameters, constructs a path to 'banner.txt' in the same directory as the script, reads its text content, and prints it. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or data leaks. The function performs a simple file read and print operation, which is typical for displaying banners or messages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to display the content of a banner text file. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
