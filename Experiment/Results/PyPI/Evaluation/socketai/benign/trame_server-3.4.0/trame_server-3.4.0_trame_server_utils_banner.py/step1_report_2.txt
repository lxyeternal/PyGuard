{
  "purpose": "Reads and prints the contents of a file named 'banner.txt' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "The line 'Path(__file__).with_name(\"banner.txt\").read_text()' reads the content of 'banner.txt' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs the contents of the file to standard output.",
  "flows": "Code reads 'banner.txt' and then prints its content to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The use of __file__ is standard, and reading a file for display purposes is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that, when called, reads a 'banner.txt' file from the same directory as the script and prints its content. There is no input from external untrusted sources beyond the filesystem, and the content is simply printed. No malicious operations such as network access, data exfiltration, or code execution are present. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple file read and print operation, which is typical for displaying banners or messages. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
