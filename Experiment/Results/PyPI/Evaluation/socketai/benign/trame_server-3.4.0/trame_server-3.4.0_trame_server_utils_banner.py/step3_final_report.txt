  "purpose": "The code reads a local file 'banner.txt' located in the same directory as the script and prints its contents to stdout.",
  "sources": "Path(__file__).with_name(\"banner.txt\") reads the file in the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "print(txt, flush=True) outputs the file content to stdout.",
  "flows": "Path(__file__).with_name(\"banner.txt\") reads the file; print outputs its content.",
  "anomalies": "The code ignores arguments; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or external data sources.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that reads and displays a local file. It does not process untrusted input, execute code, or perform network activity. The only potential concern is if 'banner.txt' contains sensitive information, printing it could leak data, but this is not malicious behavior. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for displaying a local banner file. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are present. The small security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified as a precaution for potential sensitive data leakage, but overall, the code is safe.",
