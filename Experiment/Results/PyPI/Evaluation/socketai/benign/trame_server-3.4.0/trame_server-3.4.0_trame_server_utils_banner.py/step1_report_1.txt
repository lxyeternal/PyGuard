  "purpose": "The code reads and prints the contents of a file named 'banner.txt' located in the same directory as the script.",

  "sinks": "The print() function outputs the contents of 'banner.txt' to standard output",
  "flows": "The source (file read) data flows directly into the print statement to be outputted",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code simply reads a local file and prints its contents without processing untrusted input or executing dynamic code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function print_banner that ignores its arguments, reads text from 'banner.txt' in the same directory, and prints it. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution. The code appears to be a harmless utility to display a banner or message from a local file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, designed solely to display a banner text from a local file. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
