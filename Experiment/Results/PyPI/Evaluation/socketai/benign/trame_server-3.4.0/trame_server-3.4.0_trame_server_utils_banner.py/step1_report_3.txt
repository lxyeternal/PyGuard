  "purpose": "Reads and prints the contents of a file named 'banner.txt' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "Reading the file '__file__' to locate 'banner.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Printing the content of the file to standard output.",
  "flows": "Code reads the file path based on '__file__' and passes the content to print, which outputs it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The use of Path(__file__) is standard for locating files relative to script location.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that reads 'banner.txt' located in the same directory as the script and prints its contents. It uses Path to determine the file location and read_text() to load the content, then prints it. No untrusted input handling, no external network activity, and no suspicious code behaviors are present. The function appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign function that outputs a file content. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
