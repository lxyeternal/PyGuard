{
  "purpose": "The code reads and prints the content of a file named 'banner.txt' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a file path derived from the script's own location (__file__), specifically 'banner.txt'.",
  "sinks": "The data is printed to standard output using print(), which could potentially leak information if the file contents are sensitive.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'banner.txt' from the filesystem and outputs its contents to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The use of *_, **__ to ignore arguments is a common pattern and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib to handle filesystem paths. It defines a function 'print_banner' that ignores any positional or keyword arguments. Inside the function, it constructs a path to 'banner.txt' in the same directory as the script, reads its text content, and prints it. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code. The function's purpose appears to be displaying a banner or message from a local file. The code is straightforward and appears safe. There are no external inputs or outputs beyond reading a local file and printing to stdout.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility to print the contents of 'banner.txt'. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on local files and standard output without any suspicious patterns.",
