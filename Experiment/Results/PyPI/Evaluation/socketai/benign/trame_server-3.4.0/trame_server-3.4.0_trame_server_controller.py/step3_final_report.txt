  "purpose": "A dynamic function and trigger management system allowing registration, invocation, and redefinition of functions, with support for hot reloading and asynchronous tasks.",
  "sources": "Function registration calls, internal dictionaries, weak references, and dynamic reloads.",
  "sinks": "Function invocation via stored references, dynamic reloads, and attribute assignments.",
  "flows": "Function registration → storage in internal dictionaries → invocation via __call__ or attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "Use of weak references and reloads could be exploited if malicious functions are registered; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a flexible, event-driven controller for managing functions and triggers, with dynamic registration, redefinition, and hot reload capabilities. No external input sources or malicious network activity are present. The use of weak references and reloads introduces potential misuse if malicious functions are registered, but the code itself is straightforward and legitimate. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are detected. The scores reflect the inherent risks of dynamic execution but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, flexible function management utility with inherent risks due to its dynamic features. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk is moderate (score 0.2), primarily due to potential misuse if untrusted functions are registered. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the analysis.",
