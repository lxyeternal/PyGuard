  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, flexible function management utility with inherent risks due to its dynamic features. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk is moderate (score 0.2), primarily due to potential misuse if untrusted functions are registered. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the analysis."
