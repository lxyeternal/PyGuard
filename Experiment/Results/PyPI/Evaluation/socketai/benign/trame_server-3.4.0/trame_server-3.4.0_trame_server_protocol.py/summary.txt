  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate WebSocket server implementation with no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The main security considerations are the use of a default insecure token and the potential for misuse of dynamic method registration and function execution via RPC. These issues should be addressed in deployment by changing default credentials and validating functions invoked through RPC. Overall, the code is safe but requires standard security best practices."
