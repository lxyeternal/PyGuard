  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a WebSocket server with dynamic RPC registration, environment variable configuration, and state management. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as standard, with no malicious behavior. The dynamic method registration via inspection is typical for such frameworks and not inherently malicious. The low risk score (0.2) is reasonable given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious indicators. The malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar server implementation with mention of default weak credentials (\"wslink-secret\") and dynamic function execution via 'trigger' RPC. Notes potential security issues with default credentials and unvalidated function calls.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.4\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report points out the weak default credential, which is a security concern but not malware. The 'trigger' RPC executing arbitrary functions could be risky if misused, but there's no evidence of malicious code. The risk score of 0.4 seems appropriate, considering the potential for misuse but no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Note:** The report does not suggest any malware or backdoor, just potential misconfiguration.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard WebSocket server with environment variables, file-based auth tokens, and RPC registration. No malicious activity or obfuscation observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent; the code is standard, with no malicious indicators. The low risk score is appropriate. The use of environment variables and file input is typical, with no evident malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar server code with dynamic RPC registration via method inspection, default token, and no obfuscation. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is a typical WebSocket server with dynamic RPC registration, which is standard practice. No malicious activity is identified. The risk score reflects minor concerns about default credentials and dynamic method inspection, which are common in such frameworks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard WebSocket server with environment variables, file-based auth tokens, and RPC handling. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly states that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity. The minor security concern is the default static token, but this is a common issue rather than malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the code analysis. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation is present.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Range from 0.2 to 0.4, primarily reflecting concerns about default credentials and dynamic method registration, which are common in such frameworks but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correctly assigned across reports)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the minimal security concerns, I would suggest a **risk score of approximately 0.2** to 0.3, considering default credentials and dynamic method registration as minor issues but not serious vulnerabilities.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**The reports are consistent and reasonable. No malicious activity or malware is evident. The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of a WebSocket server protocol with typical security considerations.**",
