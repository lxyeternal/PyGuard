  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard WebSocket server with dynamic RPC registration, state management, and environment/configuration handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The dynamic method introspection is typical but could be misused if protocol objects are malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The dynamic registration could be a minor concern but is common in such frameworks. No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the weak default token ('wslink-secret') and potential for the 'trigger' RPC to execute functions that could be misused if not properly validated. The code's pattern is standard but security best practices recommend avoiding default weak credentials.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.4\n\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.4 is justified due to default credentials and the potential for unsafe function execution via 'trigger'. No malware detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code manages server setup, RPC, and state updates with no signs of malicious behavior. Use of environment variables, file reading, and internal attributes are standard. No obfuscation or malware.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on the dynamic inspection of RPC methods and the default token. No malicious code or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The dynamic method registration is standard but could be exploited if malicious modifications occur.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a typical WebSocket server with standard features. The only concern is the default static token and unvalidated environment variables, which are security considerations but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Ranging from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting concerns about default credentials and dynamic method registration, which are standard considerations but not outright vulnerabilities or malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n- The only notable point is the default token ('wslink-secret')—a security best practice would be to recommend changing this default in production.\n- The dynamic method introspection is typical for RPC frameworks but should be monitored if protocol objects are manipulated maliciously.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to default credentials and dynamic introspection, but not severe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code appears safe but should be configured properly to avoid security issues related to default secrets and dynamic method registration.",
