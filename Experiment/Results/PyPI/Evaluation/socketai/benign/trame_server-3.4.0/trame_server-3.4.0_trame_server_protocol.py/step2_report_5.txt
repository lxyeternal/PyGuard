  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a WebSocket server with dynamic RPC registration, state management, and environment/configuration handling. No malicious behavior or malware detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the dynamic inspection for RPC methods as a potential risk if protocol objects are maliciously manipulated, but considers this a common pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. No issues are present in the code, and the low security risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on default weak credentials ('wslink-secret') and the potential for arbitrary function execution via 'trigger' RPC.\n- **Assessment:** The report highlights the security concern of the default token and the execution of arbitrary functions without explicit validation, which could be risky.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.4, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.8.\n\n**Verdict:** The concern about the default token and unvalidated function execution is valid. While no malicious activity is observed, these are security considerations that warrant a higher risk score than 0.2, but still not indicative of malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate WebSocket server with no signs of malicious behavior. The only concern is the static token and dynamic RPC registration.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is standard and no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on environment variables, RPC registration, and the default token.\n- **Assessment:** The dynamic inspection of methods is noted but considered standard; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard WebSocket server with no malicious behavior, but with minor security considerations like the default token.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning and scoring are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity or code is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0.2 or 0.4, citing the default token and dynamic method registration as minor concerns. This is reasonable; the default token ('wslink-secret') is insecure if not changed, and the dynamic RPC registration could be misused if protocol objects are maliciously altered.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not exhibit any malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The main security concern is the use of a default static token ('wslink-secret'), which could be exploited if not changed, and the dynamic method inspection, which is standard but could be misused if protocol objects are compromised.\n- No obfuscation, malicious network activity, or malicious code is present.\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Category        | Score |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Malware         | 0.0    |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.0    |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2    |\n\n**These scores reflect a benign codebase with minor security considerations related to default credentials and dynamic RPC registration.**",
