  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's behavior, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a server-side state management system with change detection, callback registration, asynchronous execution, and hot reload features.\n- It heavily relies on external functions (`reload`, `create_task`, `share`, etc.) and dynamic callback invocation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity is evident.\n- The primary potential security concern is executing user-supplied or external callbacks, especially with `reload()` and `create_task()`.\n- The code appears well-structured and typical for such frameworks, with no explicit malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard shared state management.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Justification:** No malicious code detected. The only concern is external callback execution, which is a common pattern.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: **0** (no malicious code or payloads) — justified.  \n- Security risk: **0.2** (low, mainly due to callback execution potential) — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, managing shared state with callbacks.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: **0** — consistent with no malicious activity.  \n- Security risk: **0.2** — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with focus on reactive updates.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: **0** — no malicious code.  \n- Security risk: **0.2** — justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar reactive state management with callbacks.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.35\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: **0** — no malicious code detected.  \n- Security risk: **0.35** — slightly higher, perhaps due to the use of `reload()` and dynamic callback execution, which could be exploited if untrusted callbacks are loaded. This is acceptable, given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: **0** — no malicious code.  \n- Security risk: **0.2** — consistent with other reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious code, payloads, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are **0**, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally around 0.2–0.35, justified by the potential for callback execution risks, especially with dynamic reloads and async functions, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's behavior. The only aspect to monitor is the execution of external or untrusted callbacks, but this is inherent in reactive frameworks and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate (post-review):**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and structured.\n- **Security risk:** **0.2–0.3** — moderate, due to callback execution and dynamic reloads, but standard for such systems.\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented reactive state management system with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The assigned scores are reasonable, and the overall security posture appears acceptable, assuming callbacks and `commit_fn` are from trusted sources.",
