  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages server lifecycle, modules, and environment configurations. No suspicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low)\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's transparency. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on environment variables and module management. No malicious activity observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The risk score remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles server start/stop, protocol, and modules with standard practices. No suspicious patterns or code execution.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code. No issues detected; the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on server management, configuration via environment variables, and protocol interactions. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code appears safe and well-structured, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a typical server class with standard environment variable use and network setup. No signs of malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the transparent code structure.\n- **Risk scores:** Uniformly low at 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — Very low, consistent with the code's purpose and analysis.\n\n**In summary,** the reports are consistent, and the scores accurately reflect the code's security posture. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured server management class with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
