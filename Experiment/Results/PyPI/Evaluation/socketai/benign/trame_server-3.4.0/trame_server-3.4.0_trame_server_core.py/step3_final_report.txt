{
  "purpose": "The code implements a 'Server' class for managing server lifecycle, state, modules, protocols, and client interactions within the 'trame' framework. It handles configuration via environment variables and command-line arguments, module loading, server start/stop, and network protocol interactions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., TRAME_LOG_NETWORK, TRAME_WS_MAX_MSG_SIZE), sys.argv for command-line arguments, external modules like CoreServer, protocol, and functions such as enable_module, start_browser, print_banner, and print_informations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication via CoreServer, protocol method calls, static file serving paths, and external functions for browser control and banner printing.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from environment variables and command-line args into server setup; module definitions and setup functions modify server state; network and protocol functions handle client-server communication; external functions invoked during server start and UI setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. The code is straightforward, with standard server management logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured server class managing lifecycle, modules, and network interactions with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Environment variables are used for configuration, which is standard. External modules and functions are invoked in controlled contexts. No dynamic code execution or suspicious data flows are present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.2 are consistent with the code's transparency and functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, transparent, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
