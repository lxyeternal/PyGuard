{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Server class for managing a web server, handling client-server communication, state management, modules, and network operations in a framework called 'trame'.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, command line arguments, method parameters, and imported modules; notably, environment variables for configuration and sys.argv for command-line flags.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into network communication functions such as CoreServer.bind_server(), CoreServer.server_start(), and protocol.push_actions(), which send data over websockets; also, environment variables are set for configuration.",
  "flows": "Configuration flows from environment variables and method parameters into server setup and network functions; environment variables influence server behavior, and method calls like start() invoke network operations through CoreServer and protocol objects.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. Usage of environment variables for configuration is standard, and network functions are called with parameters rather than hardcoded data. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present. The code contains typical server setup logic and lifecycle management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation of a server class, primarily handling server startup, state, modules, and communication. It relies on external modules and environment variables for configuration. The network-related functions delegate to external CoreServer and protocol objects, which are not included here but are typical in server frameworks. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. The environment variables used for configuration are common in server applications. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation is detected. The code appears to be a legitimate server setup with standard patterns for managing server lifecycle, modules, and communication channels.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate server management class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses environment variables and external modules for configuration and network operations in a typical manner. No malicious intent or sabotage is evident.",
