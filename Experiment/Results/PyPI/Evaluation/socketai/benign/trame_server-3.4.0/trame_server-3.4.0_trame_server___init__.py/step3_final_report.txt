  "purpose": "Module initialization and metadata setup for the package, importing core classes and functions, and defining public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .client, .core, .utils.version; call to get_version(\"trame-server\")",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Import statements and get_version call; setting __version__, __license__, and __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and assignment statements, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py setup for a Python package, importing local classes and functions, retrieving version info via get_version, and defining metadata. No external data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The get_version function is presumed to safely retrieve version info, likely from package metadata. The code structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The overall pattern indicates a benign package initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package setup module with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals point to benign, straightforward code, and the scores should reflect zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
