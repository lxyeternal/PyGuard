  "purpose": "To define module exports and retrieve the version information for the 'trame-server' package.",
  "sources": "get_version(\"trame-server\") function call, import statements",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted data or output data",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; version retrieval is a read-only operation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and functions, then sets module-level variables for version, license, and exports. The get_version function is invoked to obtain the package version, which appears to be a standard call. No user input, network operations, or data processing occurs within this snippet. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward module initialization script, exporting classes and retrieving version info without any malicious intent or security issues.",
