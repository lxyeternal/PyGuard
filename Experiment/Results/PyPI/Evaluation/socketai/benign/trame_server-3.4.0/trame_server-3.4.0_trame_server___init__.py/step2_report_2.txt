  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe provided code is a standard Python module initialization script, importing local classes/functions, setting version and license info, and defining the public API via `__all__`. The `get_version(\"trame-server\")` call retrieves version info, likely from package metadata or a version file.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** The report states there's no malicious behavior, no anomalies, and the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; the code is simple and standard. The `get_version` function is common for version retrieval.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing no external data processing or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Justification:** The logic is consistent; the code only performs imports and sets metadata.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates the straightforward nature, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Justification:** Correct; no external data handling or suspicious constructs.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Also aligns with previous assessments; the code is typical for package initialization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious patterns or anomalies.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: standard package setup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0\n- **Justification:** The code is simple, and the reasoning is valid.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code being straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified because there's no evidence of vulnerabilities, external data handling, or malicious intent.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n- Given the evidence, the code appears safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reasoning aligns with the assessments provided. The code is a typical package initialization script, with no apparent security issues.",
