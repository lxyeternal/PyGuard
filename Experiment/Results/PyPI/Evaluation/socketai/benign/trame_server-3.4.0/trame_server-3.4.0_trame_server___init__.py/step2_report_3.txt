  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code, and evaluating the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports `Client`, `Server`, and `get_version` from local modules.\n- Sets `__version__` by calling `get_version(\"trame-server\")`.\n- Defines `__license__`.\n- Exports `Client` and `Server` via `__all__`.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` or module setup script.\n- No data processing, external network activity, or user input handling.\n- The `get_version` function is standard for retrieving version info, presumably from package metadata or files.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Module setup, no data sinks, anomalies, or malicious code.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues found. Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, straightforward version retrieval.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No problems, scores are justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, with emphasis on safe imports and version retrieval.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment. No risks.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same pattern, standard package init.\n- Confidence: 0.9 (slightly less, but still high)\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as others, no suspicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### General conclusions:\n- All reports agree that the code is standard package setup code.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this review, I would concur with the current scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, safe module initialization snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that.",
