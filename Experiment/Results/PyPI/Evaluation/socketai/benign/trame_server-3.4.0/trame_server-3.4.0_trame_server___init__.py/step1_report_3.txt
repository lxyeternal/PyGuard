{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules and functions related to a server and client implementation, sets version and license information, and defines what components are publicly accessible.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from imported modules and functions, especially the get_version function call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the code does not process external input directly.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing modules and calling get_version to set __version__, with no data flowing from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; however, reliance on get_version may warrant verification if the function is safe. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports components from relative modules, sets version and license info, and defines exports. It relies on get_version to determine the version string, which is a common pattern. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, credential handling, or hidden backdoors. The structure and content are typical for a package __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a Python package initialization, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs package setup tasks safely.",
