{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package initialization, exporting specific classes and functions for external use, and setting version and license metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements for client, server, and version functions; get_version function call with parameter 'trame-server'.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward; get_version likely reads package metadata or version info from the filesystem or package resources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. The get_version call appears standard for versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three modules or functions: 'Client', 'Server', and 'get_version'. It assigns a version string using get_version with a static package name. It sets license info and exports a list of public symbols. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. The get_version function's implementation isn't shown, but its usage here seems standard for package versioning. The overall structure aligns with typical package init files. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and exports components and metadata. Based on this fragment, the package appears safe.",
