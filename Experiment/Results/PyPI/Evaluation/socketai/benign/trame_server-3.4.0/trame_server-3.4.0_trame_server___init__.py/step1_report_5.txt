{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports classes and functions related to a server-client architecture, setting version and license information for a Python package.",
  "sources": "get_version(\"trame-server\") function call, importing from local modules (.client, .core, .utils.version)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks are evident in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input to potential sinks are present; mainly static assignments and imports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed; use of get_version is standard, assuming it properly retrieves version info",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, setting version and license metadata, and defining the __all__ export list. The get_version function is invoked with a static string argument, likely retrieving package version info. No user input handling, no network communication, no suspicious code patterns, and no obfuscated or unusual constructs are present. This is typical package metadata code, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward package setup code with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It merely sets up package metadata and exports classes from local modules. Overall, the code appears safe.",
