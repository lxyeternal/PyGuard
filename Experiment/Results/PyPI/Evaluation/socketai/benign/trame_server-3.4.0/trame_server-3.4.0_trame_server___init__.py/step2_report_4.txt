  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward module setup; no malicious behavior, data flow, or anomalies.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.  \n- **Scores:** All scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Justification:** The code is simple and standard; no reason to change scores.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no malicious activity, no anomalies.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Justification:** Standard package initialization, no security concern.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Again, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, matching the report.  \n- **Justification:** Typical import and version retrieval, safe.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No anomalies or malicious indicators.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.  \n- **Justification:** Standard package setup.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; no malicious activity or anomalies.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets are consistent across reports, and all indicate a standard package initialization pattern.  \n- **Malware risk:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The `get_version` function is a common pattern, assuming it safely retrieves version info.  \n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.  \n- **Security risk:** Given the lack of any anomalies, data flow issues, or external interactions, the risk score should remain at 0.  \n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)  \n\nThese scores are consistent with the reports and the code's nature. The overall assessment confirms the code is a benign, standard package initialization snippet with no security concerns.",
