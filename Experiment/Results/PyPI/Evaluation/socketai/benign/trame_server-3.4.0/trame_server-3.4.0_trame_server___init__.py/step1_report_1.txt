{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module exports for a Python package, defining version, license, and public API components.",
  "sources": "Import statements for client, server, and version utility functions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The get_version function call might be dynamic but is standard for versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports components from local modules, assigns version and license information, and defines the public API via __all__. The get_version function could involve dynamic retrieval of version info, but this is a common practice. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code structures are evident. No external network interactions or data leaks are observed. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears to be a standard module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initialization snippet for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
