{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for terminal text coloring and cursor manipulation.",
  "sources": "Constants and functions that define ANSI escape sequences, class attributes defining color codes, and methods that generate escape sequences based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that produce ANSI escape sequences, which are terminal control codes for visual effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., color codes, cursor positions) flow into methods which generate corresponding ANSI escape sequences for terminal output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions to generate ANSI escape codes for terminal coloring and cursor control. It uses straightforward string concatenation and attribute definitions. There are no input/output operations involving untrusted data, no code injection, no network activity, and no cryptographic or credential handling. The code appears to be well-structured, clear, and purely for terminal formatting purposes. No malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for generating ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain security issues. It is safe and intended for terminal UI enhancement.",
