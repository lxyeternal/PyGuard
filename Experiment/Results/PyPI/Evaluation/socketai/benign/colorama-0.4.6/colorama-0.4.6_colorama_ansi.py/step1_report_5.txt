{
  "purpose": "The code generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "The code defines constants and functions that produce ANSI escape sequences based on input parameters and class attributes. It does not read external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The functions return strings containing ANSI escape sequences; these could be used to manipulate terminal output. There are no sinks that send data externally, such as network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (like color codes, cursor positions) flow into functions that generate ANSI strings; these strings are returned and intended for terminal output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior is present. The code strictly generates terminal escape sequences without any side effects or hidden operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for coloring and cursor control in terminals. It includes functions for setting terminal titles, clearing screens or lines, and classes for color and style codes. All code is straightforward, using static attributes and simple string concatenations. No external data, network operations, or obfuscated code is present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for terminal text formatting using ANSI escape sequences. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility library for terminal control.",
