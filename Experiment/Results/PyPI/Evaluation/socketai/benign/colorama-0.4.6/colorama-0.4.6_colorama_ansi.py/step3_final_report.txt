  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, including colors, cursor movements, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (e.g., mode, x, y, n, title) used to generate escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "Generated escape sequence strings intended for terminal output; no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "Parameters are combined with control characters to produce escape sequences; no external data flows into these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. It does not process external input, execute dynamic code, or handle untrusted data. The functions and classes produce static or parameterized strings used for terminal control. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only minor point is that escape sequences could be misused if untrusted input is passed externally, but in this code, no such input is processed. The security risk score of 0.1 in one report is slightly overestimated; in isolation, the code is safe. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero. Overall, the code is a benign utility for terminal styling with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is negligible. The minor security risk score assigned in one report can be adjusted to zero for accuracy.",
