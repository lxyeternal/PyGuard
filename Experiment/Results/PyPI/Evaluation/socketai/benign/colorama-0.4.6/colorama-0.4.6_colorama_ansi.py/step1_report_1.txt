{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, such as setting colors, styles, cursor positioning, and clearing parts of the terminal display.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources or user input processing observed in the code.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs and returns ANSI escape sequences and control codes as strings, which are sent to the terminal for display purposes.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data; the code simply generates escape sequences based on method parameters without any external data influencing control flow or content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or dynamic code execution. It relies on standard terminal control sequences and class attribute definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for generating ANSI escape sequences used for terminal formatting. It includes functions for common operations like setting titles, clearing screens/lines, and classes for cursor positioning, foreground, background, and style attributes. The class constructors wrap class attribute values with escape sequences during instantiation, which is a standard approach. No data input, dynamic code execution, or external dependencies are present. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious intent, or malicious behavior. The implementation appears to be a benign utility for terminal text formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless utility for generating ANSI escape codes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is purely to facilitate terminal text styling, and it does so without any suspicious features.",
