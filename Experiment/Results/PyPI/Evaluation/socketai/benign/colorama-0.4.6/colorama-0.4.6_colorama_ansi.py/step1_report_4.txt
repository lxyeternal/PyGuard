{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for coloring and formatting terminal output, including cursor positioning.",
  "sources": "The code defines constants and methods that generate escape sequences based on input parameters, but does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs escape sequences to the terminal, which could be exploited if input data is used improperly. However, in this code, the sequences are generated internally without untrusted input.",
  "flows": "There are no external source-to-sink data flows. The functions generate escape sequences based on parameters, but do not process external untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. All code appears to be standard for generating terminal escape sequences. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for generating ANSI escape sequences for text formatting, cursor control, and color. It converts numeric codes into escape sequences, and the class constructors dynamically assign these sequences to instance attributes. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for terminal text formatting using ANSI escape codes. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module for terminal color and cursor control.",
