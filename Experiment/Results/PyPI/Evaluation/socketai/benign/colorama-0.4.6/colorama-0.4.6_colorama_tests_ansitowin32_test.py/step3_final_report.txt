{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for console stream handling, ANSI escape sequence processing, and Windows console mode interactions within the colorama library.",
  "sources": "Mocked stream objects, environment patches, and internal method calls; no external data sources or network inputs.",
  "sinks": "Internal method calls, mock interactions, and environment modifications; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (ANSI sequences, stream writes) processed through class methods, with mock calls verifying behavior; no external data flow or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of extensive mocking and environment patches is typical for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for stream and ANSI handling classes, employing mocks and environment patches to simulate system conditions. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present. The structure is clear, and the purpose is solely to verify functionality. The high confidence scores reflect the benign nature. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the testing scope and environment manipulation, which could pose minimal risk if misused outside a test context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
