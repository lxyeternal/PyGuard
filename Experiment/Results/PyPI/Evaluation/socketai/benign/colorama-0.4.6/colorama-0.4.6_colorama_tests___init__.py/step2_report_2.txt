  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code snippets are solely license comments with no executable code, data input/output, or suspicious constructs. Therefore, there are no issues or vulnerabilities present in these snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that these are license comments with no security implications.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the content.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable since the analysis is straightforward.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No report assigns a risk score above 0.5, which aligns with the absence of any security concern.\n   - The risk scores are all 0, correctly indicating no security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct since no malicious activity is observed.\n   - The content is purely licensing comments, with no executable or suspicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately state that these snippets are benign license headers.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports, reflecting the content accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nGiven the provided snippets are only license comments with no executable code, data flow, or suspicious patterns, **the overall security risk is negligible**. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My personal estimate aligns with the reports:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThere are no security concerns to flag in these snippets.",
