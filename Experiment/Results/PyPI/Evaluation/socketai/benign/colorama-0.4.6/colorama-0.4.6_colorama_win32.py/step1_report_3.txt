{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for interacting with Windows console APIs, such as getting console info, setting text attributes, cursor position, title, and console mode.",
  "sources": "Imports from ctypes and windll.kernel32 to access Windows API functions; reads handle values from standard output and error streams.",
  "sinks": "Functions that set console text attributes, cursor positions, console titles, and modes, which could influence console behavior but do not pose direct data leaks or execution risks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from standard handles (STDOUT, STDERR) through API calls to modify console settings. No untrusted external input is processed; all data is internally managed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward and primarily interacts with Windows console functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily wraps Windows console API functions for manipulating console properties. It handles API imports and function definitions with proper error checks, such as raising exceptions if console mode changes fail. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not process untrusted input nor executes external commands or code. It is focused solely on console manipulation, which is common and benign for terminal utilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for Windows console interaction. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code appears to be designed for improving console display and control. No security risks are evident beyond normal API usage, which is safe within the scope of console management.",
