{
  "purpose": "Provides Windows console API wrappers for manipulating console attributes, cursor position, buffer info, and title.",
  "sources": "ctypes library loading, Windows API functions (_GetStdHandle, _GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, etc.), parameters passed to functions (stream_id, attrs, position, title).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; functions operate on system handles and parameters supplied by the caller, with no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Function calls to Windows API functions with parameters; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward API wrapper with standard error handling. Minor note: __str__ method in CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO accesses attributes correctly but could clarify coordinate attribute naming; no security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code loads Windows console API functions via ctypes, providing utility functions for console control. It handles import errors gracefully, offering fallback functions. No untrusted input processing, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions are standard wrappers around system calls, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only potential concern is misuse if parameters are maliciously crafted, but the code itself does not process untrusted data or perform risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console utility library with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk and is safe for use. The provided scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
