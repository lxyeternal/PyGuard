{
  "purpose": "This code manages the initialization, wrapping, and deinitialization of standard output and error streams, particularly for handling ANSI escape sequences on Windows platforms.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout, sys.stderr, environment platform information (sys.platform)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout and sys.stderr are reassigned to wrapped streams; potential for data interception or modification",
  "flows": "Input data (from sys.stdout/sys.stderr) can be wrapped or replaced with custom stream objects; wrapped streams may process or modify output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Uses global variables to manage internal state, but no suspicious logic or obfuscation. No network activity or data exfiltration code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles stream wrapping for ANSI escape sequence support on Windows, including initialization, cleanup, and platform-specific adjustments. Functions like 'init' and 'deinit' modify sys.stdout and sys.stderr, potentially altering output streams. The code does not perform any network communication, data collection, or execute external commands. It employs global variables for state management but does not introduce any malicious or suspicious behavior. The usage of atexit for cleanup is standard. No signs of malware or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for managing console output streams and ensuring ANSI compatibility on Windows. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code.",
