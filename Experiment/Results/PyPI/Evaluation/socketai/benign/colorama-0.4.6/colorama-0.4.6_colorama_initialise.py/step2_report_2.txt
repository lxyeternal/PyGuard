  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages console output streams, especially for Windows ANSI support, with functions for initialization, cleanup, and internal state management.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no suspicious network activity, straightforward stream handling.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, confidence 1. The reasoning aligns with the code's functionality.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is standard for console handling, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on Windows ANSI support, stream wrapping, and environment configuration.\n- **Findings:** No malicious intent, standard platform checks, no obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1, confidence 0.9. The slight security risk score accounts for potential stream manipulation, but overall, the code is benign.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the minor security risk is justified given stream reassignments.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Manages ANSI support, stream wrapping, and internal state for Windows consoles.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no network activity, standard stream wrapping.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.95. The security risk reflects the potential for stream modification, but no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on ANSI support, stream wrapping, and platform-specific behavior.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, standard use of AnsiToWin32, no obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9. The risk score accounts for stream wrapping, but no malicious intent is observed.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Handles console output formatting, with setup and teardown functions.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no network activity, standard stream management.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9. The use of global variables and stream wrapping is typical; no malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0.1 in some reports, justified by stream manipulation potential, but no actual security risk is evident.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nConsidering all reports and their reasoning, I concur with their assessments. The code is a standard utility for console stream handling, especially for Windows ANSI support, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**My personal scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect the potential for stream modification, but not actual risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
