  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, logic, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as managing console output streams, particularly for ANSI escape code support on Windows.\n- They note the use of global variables, stream wrapping, and cleanup routines via atexit.\n- No report mentions suspicious external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The code appears standard for its purpose: handling terminal formatting, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Console stream wrapping, ANSI support.\n- **Findings:** Reads/writes to sys.stdout/sys.stderr; uses atexit; no malicious code.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The score of 1 for risk seems high given the straightforward nature. The code is typical for such utilities.  \n**Recommendation:** Reduce risk score to 0.1–0.2, reflecting low risk but acknowledging some global state manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, platform-specific ANSI support.\n- **Findings:** Replaces sys.stdout/sys.stderr; no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate; minimal risk, standard stream wrapping.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same core functionality.\n- **Findings:** Reassigns sys.stdout/sys.stderr; no malicious code.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the previous; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Handles ANSI support, stream wrapping.\n- **Findings:** Uses AnsiToWin32; no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Manages console output, testing utilities.\n- **Findings:** Similar stream wrapping; no malicious code.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Judgment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a utility for ANSI support, not malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** The highest risk score is 1 (Report 1), which overstates the risk of this code. Given its purpose, the risk is minimal, primarily related to global state changes and stream manipulation, which are common in such utilities.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, mostly due to global state manipulation, which is typical and necessary for such utilities)\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The code is standard for console output handling, especially for cross-platform ANSI support.\n- No evidence suggests malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.\n- The risk score should be lowered from 1 to around 0.1–0.2 for accuracy.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and typical for its intended purpose.",
