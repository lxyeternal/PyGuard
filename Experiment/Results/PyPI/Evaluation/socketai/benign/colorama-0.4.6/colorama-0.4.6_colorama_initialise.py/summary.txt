  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for cross-platform console output management, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the risk score should be lowered from 1 to approximately 0.1–0.2 to better reflect the minimal security concern associated with stream manipulation. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose."
