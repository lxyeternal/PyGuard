{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for handling ANSI escape sequences in terminal output, converting them into Windows API calls or stripping them, and wrapping output streams for colored and styled terminal output.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), accessing sys.stdout and sys.stderr streams, and regex matching ANSI sequences within text.",
  "sinks": "Writing to wrapped streams, calling Windows API functions for terminal styling, and modifying terminal title via winterm.set_title().",
  "flows": "Input (ANSI sequences or text) flows through conversion and stripping functions, which may invoke Windows API calls (win32 functions) to modify terminal display or title, then outputs to the stream.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regular expressions to parse ANSI sequences and may convert or strip them; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification beyond terminal styling is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on ANSI sequence handling for terminal styling and does not include any network or system modification code. It wraps output streams to control styling via Windows API calls on Windows systems. No suspicious or malicious logic such as data theft, command injection, or backdoors is present. All operations appear related to terminal styling and output formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a terminal styling utility with no malicious intent. It safely manages ANSI sequences and modifies terminal appearance on Windows. No malware or malicious behavior detected. The code is well-structured and uses standard patterns for ANSI processing and stream handling.",
