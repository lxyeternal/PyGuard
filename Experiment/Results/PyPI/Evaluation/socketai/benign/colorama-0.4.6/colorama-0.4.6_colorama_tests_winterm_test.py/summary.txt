  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.1 in one case is slightly cautious but acceptable given the controlled testing environment. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
