  "purpose": "Unit testing module for ANSI escape sequences and compatibility wrappers in colorama-like library.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout, sys.stderr, module imports (ansi, ansitowin32)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code primarily checks constants and resets sys.stdout/stderr",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; tests perform static assertions and mock sys.stdout/stderr restoration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected; code appears to be standard test code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite verifying ANSI color codes and ensuring sys.stdout/stderr are correctly handled. It uses static assertions to verify known ANSI escape sequences and tests environment cleanup with setUp and tearDown methods. No input/output from external or untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for ANSI escape code constants and compatibility wrappers. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
