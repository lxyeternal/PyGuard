{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit testing module verifying ANSI escape sequence constants for foreground, background, and style attributes, ensuring they match expected escape codes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static constant definitions from imported modules (Fore, Back, Style). It also interacts with sys.stdout and sys.stderr during setup and teardown.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not process external data or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing constants, asserting their values, and restoring standard output streams; no dynamic data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, straightforward unit test suite verifying predefined ANSI escape sequence constants. It performs assertions on known static values and manages environment cleanup. There are no dynamic inputs, external communications, or suspicious behaviors. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite verifying ANSI escape sequences with no security risks or malicious behavior. It poses no supply chain threat and is safe for use. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero.",
