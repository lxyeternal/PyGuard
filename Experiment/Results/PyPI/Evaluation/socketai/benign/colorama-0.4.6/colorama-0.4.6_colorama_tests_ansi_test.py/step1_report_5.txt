{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test suite for verifying ANSI escape code constants in a color formatting library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the sys module's stdout and stderr for setup checks, and imports from local modules for ANSI color definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only verifies static constants and performs assertions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, performing setup assertions, and executing tests for static values. No dynamic data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code uses standard testing practices and constants.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test verifying that ANSI color and style constants match expected escape sequences. It imports necessary modules, asserts initial conditions, and verifies constants. No user input, network operations, or data manipulation occurs. The code does not include any dynamic execution, obfuscated patterns, or malicious code. It appears to be a benign test suite for a formatting library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test verifying static ANSI escape code constants. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. It functions solely as a test for color code constants.",
