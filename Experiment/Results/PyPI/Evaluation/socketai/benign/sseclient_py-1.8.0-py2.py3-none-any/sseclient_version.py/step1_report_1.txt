  "analysis": "The code simply assigns static string values to two variables. There are no input/output operations, no external data fetching, no dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive operations. It appears to be part of a package's metadata or configuration. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata definitions for a package. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
