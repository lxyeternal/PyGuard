  "purpose": "Assigning package name and version, likely for package setup or metadata.",
  "sources": "Variables 'name' and 'version' are assigned string literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted inputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only involves variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected; simple metadata assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward variable assignments defining package name and version. There are no inputs, outputs, or code execution that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be part of a setup or configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as basic metadata definition for a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
