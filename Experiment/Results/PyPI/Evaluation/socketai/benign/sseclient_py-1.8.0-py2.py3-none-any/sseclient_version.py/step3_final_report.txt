  "purpose": "Static assignment of package name and version metadata, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static variable assignments in code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external calls or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only assigns static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and metadata-related.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static strings to variables 'name' and 'version'. All reports confirm absence of input/output, external calls, dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is part of package metadata, with no security implications. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1 are justified and consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
