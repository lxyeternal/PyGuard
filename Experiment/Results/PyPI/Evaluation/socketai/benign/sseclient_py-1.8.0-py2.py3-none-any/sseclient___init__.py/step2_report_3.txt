  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   - All reports conclude that the code functions as a standard SSE client with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.  \n   - The code reads from an input stream, decodes, parses, and yields events, following the SSE protocol.  \n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network exfiltration mechanisms are present.  \n   - The code uses standard Python features, with logging for debugging, and handles partial chunks correctly.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and agree that the code is a straightforward, standard implementation.  \n   - No logical errors or security flaws are identified in the analysis.  \n   - The reasoning appears sound: the code is standard, well-structured, and does not exhibit malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.  \n   - The security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal risk, which is reasonable given the code's nature.  \n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9), consistent with the thorough analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   - None of the reports suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious activity that would justify a higher risk score.  \n   - The code strictly adheres to SSE standards and does not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified given the lack of malicious behavior.  \n   - No hidden payloads, backdoors, or network exfiltration are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - All reports are cautious and evidence-based, with no unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n   - The high confidence and zero malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk Score**: **0.1–0.2** — Very low, consistent with a standard, safe implementation.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an SSE client. It adheres to protocol standards, handles data securely, and contains no suspicious or malicious features. The reports are accurate, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Estimated final scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1–0.2 |\n\n**Summary**: The code is safe, well-implemented, and free of security concerns.",
