{
  "purpose": "Implement a Server-Sent Events (SSE) client in Python to receive and process SSE streams from an existing HTTP response.",
  "sources": "Reads data from an event_source stream, decodes lines, and processes event fields.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; data is processed internally and logged.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the event_source stream through _read() to events(), where lines are decoded and parsed into Event objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code uses standard logging and stream processing without obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code reads from an input stream, accumulates chunks, splits them into lines, decodes the lines, and processes them into event objects based on the SSE protocol. It handles partial chunks, comment lines, and concatenates data fields across multiple lines. Logging is used for debugging purposes. There are no indications of malicious code such as network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoors. The code operates within standard SSE client implementation patterns, with no suspicious or anomalous features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an SSE client, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only reads and processes incoming data streams according to the SSE specification, with standard logging and stream management.",
