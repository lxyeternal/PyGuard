{
  "purpose": "Implement a Server-Side Events (SSE) client for consuming SSE streams over HTTP.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'event_source' stream, which is expected to be an HTTP response stream.",
  "sinks": "Potentially decodes data from the stream and processes it into event objects; does not appear to directly write or transmit untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'event_source' stream, is read in chunks, split into lines, decoded, and assembled into Event objects which are then yielded.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No external network connections or data exfiltration observed. The code follows standard SSE parsing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an SSE client, reading and parsing events from a stream, decoding lines, and constructing event objects. It uses standard libraries and methods without suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are evident. The logging appears to be for debugging and monitoring normal operation. The implementation adheres to the SSE specification. No external or hidden network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, legitimate implementation of an SSE client with no malicious intent. It is well-structured, follows standard protocols, and does not contain suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
