{
  "purpose": "Implement a client to receive Server-Sent Events (SSE) from an HTTP response stream.",
  "sources": "Reads data from an existing HTTP response stream (_event_source), processes lines from the stream, and interprets SSE fields.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data is sent or written to external systems within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the _event_source stream into the _read() generator, then into events() which processes and yields Event objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard logging and data parsing. No external network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard SSE client, reading from a stream, parsing SSE fields, and generating event objects. It performs decoding, line splitting, and event dispatching in a typical manner. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. The implementation relies on standard Python features and the provided input stream, with no external network activity or data leakage mechanisms present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an SSE client without any malicious behavior or security risks. It processes server-sent events securely, with no signs of sabotage or malware. The overall security risk is minimal.",
