{
  "purpose": "Implement a Server-Side Events (SSE) client to receive and process SSE streams over HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the event source stream (_event_source), which is expected to be a binary stream such as an HTTPResponse object.",
  "sinks": "Processes incoming chunks from the source, decodes lines, and constructs Event objects. No apparent sinks for untrusted data to external systems are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the binary stream (source), through chunk processing, line splitting, decoding, and populating Event object attributes before yielding events.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or secret keys. The code's logic is standard for SSE processing. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is present. No network connections or data exfiltration is observed within this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SSE client implementation that reads, decodes, and constructs events from an HTTP response stream. It uses standard Python constructs and logging for debugging. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The flow is strictly input processing and event dispatching. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and the code aligns with expected patterns for SSE clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate SSE client implementation with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It properly processes SSE streams and logs its activity without performing any unsafe operations or exfiltration. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
