{
  "purpose": "Provides a generator of SSE received through an existing HTTP response, implementing a client for Server-Sent Events.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the event_source stream, decoding chunks and lines, parsing SSE fields.",
  "sinks": "Event object fields (id, event, data, retry) are set internally; no external sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Input stream -> chunk splitting -> line decoding -> field parsing -> event object creation -> event dispatching.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard SSE handling with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an SSE client, reading from a stream, handling partial chunks, decoding lines, and parsing SSE fields into Event objects. It correctly manages multi-line data, comments, and default event names. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. Logging is used for debugging, not security. The code adheres to SSE specifications and processes data securely. No external network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of an SSE client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as intended without malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
