  "purpose": "Implement a Server-Side Events (SSE) client for Python to receive and process SSE data streams.",
  "sources": "event_source parameter (stream input), line.decode(self._char_enc) (decoding data from bytes to string)",
  "sinks": "self._logger.debug() (logs debug info), event.data (processed data), self._event_source.close() (closes stream)",
  "flows": "Read chunks from event_source -> split lines -> decode lines -> parse fields -> construct Event objects -> yield events",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network connections or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from an input stream, processes server-sent event messages, and yields event objects. It performs standard parsing and decoding operations. The logging statements are for debugging purposes. The stream is closed explicitly via the close() method. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The module strictly adheres to SSE protocol standards without suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical SSE client implementation with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, malicious data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of logging is for debugging and does not pose a security concern. Overall, the package appears safe.",
