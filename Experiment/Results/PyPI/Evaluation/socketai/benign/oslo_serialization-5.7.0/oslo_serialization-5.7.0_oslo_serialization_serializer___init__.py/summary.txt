  "conclusion": "Report 1's high obfuscation (0.8) and malware (0.6) scores are justified given the suspicious patterns described. Other reports correctly identify benign or insufficient code, with scores aligned to their assessments. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the evidence; Report 1 warrants cautious suspicion, but without concrete malicious activity, the scores remain conservative."
