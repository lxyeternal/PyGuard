  "purpose": "Analysis of Python package code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic imports, eval()/exec() calls, external data fetching, hardcoded credentials or URLs.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external data, dynamic code execution, network communication, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval()/exec() and dynamic imports lead to code execution sinks; external data sources may flow into eval()/exec().",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, use of eval()/exec() on external data, complex or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of obfuscated malicious scripts, including dynamic imports and eval()/exec() usage, which suggest potential malicious intent. Absence of such patterns indicates benign code. The scores assigned in reports reflect these observations, with higher suspicion scores correlating with obfuscation and dynamic code execution. No concrete malicious actions like data exfiltration or system damage are confirmed, but patterns warrant caution. Reports with no code or minimal code are correctly scored as low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1's high obfuscation (0.8) and malware (0.6) scores are justified given the suspicious patterns described. Other reports correctly identify benign or insufficient code, with scores aligned to their assessments. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the evidence; Report 1 warrants cautious suspicion, but without concrete malicious activity, the scores remain conservative.",
