  "purpose": "Utility module for converting complex Python objects into JSON serializable formats, with custom handling for specific data types and safe serialization/deserialization functions.",
  "sources": "None; primarily reads no untrusted input or data sources within this code. It provides functions for serializing/deserializing data passed to its functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions serialize data structures to JSON strings or bytes; no direct untrusted data handling within this code itself.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code provides utility functions rather than active data flows. The functions convert in-memory data structures to JSON and vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Usage of importutils.try_import indicates optional imports. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code handles complex objects for serialization but does not execute external code or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility for JSON serialization/deserialization with robust handling for various data types, including datetime, UUID, IP addresses, and complex objects. It uses safe practices such as fallback functions and level/depth limits to avoid infinite recursion. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. The import of optional modules (ipaddress, netaddr) is handled securely, and all operations are confined to data transformation. No external network, system commands, or sensitive data handling are present. The only noteworthy aspect is the optional inclusion of 'anyjson' for extended JSON support, which is a standard pattern and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for JSON serialization with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It performs data conversion tasks safely and without side effects.",
