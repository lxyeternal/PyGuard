  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting complex objects into JSON-serializable primitives, and for serializing/deserializing JSON data.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (json, codecs, datetime, uuid, etc.), configuration variables, and functions that process input objects.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps, json.loads, json.dump, json.load, and anyjson's functions, which handle serialized data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects through to JSON serialization/deserialization functions, with potential conversion via 'to_primitive'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; use of importutils.try_import for optional modules is benign. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No code injection or unsafe SQL practices present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for safely converting complex Python objects into JSON-compatible formats. It handles special data types like datetime, UUID, and IP addresses, and manages recursion and depth to avoid cycles. It includes fallback mechanisms and error handling. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network activity are evident. The use of optional imports and standard library functions aligns with secure coding practices. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured, safe utility module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard JSON utility module with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs data serialization tasks securely and efficiently, with no suspicious signals.",
