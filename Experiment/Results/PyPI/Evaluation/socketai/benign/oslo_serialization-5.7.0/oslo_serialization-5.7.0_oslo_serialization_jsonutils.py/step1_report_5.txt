  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting complex Python objects into JSON-serializable primitives, and for JSON serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input data could come from any functions or external sources calling dumps, dump, loads, or load; particularly from data being serialized or deserialized.",
  "sinks": "Serialized JSON data sent to output streams or network, deserialized data used internally; no explicit external data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources into to_primitive or JSON functions, then possibly to output streams or internal variables, with no external or malicious data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of importutils.try_import for optional dependencies (ipaddress, netaddr) is standard. The fallback for unconvertible objects is straightforward. No obfuscated code or hidden logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The module provides JSON serialization/deserialization with enhanced handling of complex objects via to_primitive. It safely handles various data types, including datetime, UUID, IP addresses, and exceptions. No external network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Use of optional dependencies is benign. The fallback mechanisms and recursive conversion are standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, and the code primarily serves as a utility library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured utility for JSON serialization in Python with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It focuses on safe data conversion and serialization without external communication or security vulnerabilities.",
