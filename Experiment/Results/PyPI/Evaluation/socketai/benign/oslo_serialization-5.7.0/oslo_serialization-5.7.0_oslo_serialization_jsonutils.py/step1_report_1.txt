  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting complex Python objects into JSON-serializable primitives and handling JSON serialization/deserialization with support for various data types.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from JSON strings (loads), file streams (load), and function parameters for serialization.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.dumps, json.dump, json.loads, json.load for serialization/deserialization; no external or untrusted input flows directly to sensitive sinks in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (JSON strings, files) through conversion functions into Python objects, and vice versa, with no evidence of untrusted data affecting system or causing malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated features, or suspicious patterns detected. Use of importutils.try_import for optional modules is standard. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Defensive fallback for complex objects is present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for JSON serialization/deserialization with extended support for complex types (datetime, UUID, IP addresses). It uses a recursive approach to convert objects into primitives suitable for JSON, with depth limiting to prevent cycles. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of optional imports (ipaddress, netaddr) is benign. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign utility library for JSON handling with robust object serialization support. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The code follows standard practices and is safe for use.",
