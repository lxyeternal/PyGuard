  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding data using Base64, supporting both string and byte inputs and outputs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in functions such as encode_as_bytes, encode_as_text, decode_as_bytes, decode_as_text; potential external data passed into these functions.",
  "sinks": "Base64 encoding/decoding functions, data returned to caller; no external data sinks or network connections observed.",
  "flows": "Input data received in encode/decode functions → processed via base64 encoding/decoding → output returned; no external transmission or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. No use of dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward Base64 encoding and decoding functions, with proper input validation and error handling. It uses standard library modules without any unusual logic or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware. The functions are typical utility methods for data encoding, with no insecure operations or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of Base64 encoding/decoding utilities with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and intended solely for data encoding purposes.",
