  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding data using Base64 in various formats (bytes and text).",
  "sources": "Input parameters to encode_as_bytes, encode_as_text, decode_as_bytes, and decode_as_text functions, including user-supplied strings or data.",
  "sinks": "Base64 encoding/decoding functions that output encoded or decoded data; no external or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into encoding/decoding functions; data is transformed through base64 operations; output is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No use of environment variables, network connections, or external system access.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward Base64 encoding and decoding utilities, handling both string and byte inputs. Functions are designed with clear input validation and exception handling for invalid data. There are no network operations, no external data sources, and no system modifications. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy-violating mechanisms. It is a simple utility module with no apparent security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for Base64 encoding/decoding, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of common encoding functions.",
