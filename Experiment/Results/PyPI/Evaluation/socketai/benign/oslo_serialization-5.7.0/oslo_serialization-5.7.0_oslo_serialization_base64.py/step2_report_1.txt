  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as straightforward, standard Base64 encoding/decoding utilities.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected.\n- No external system interactions, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The functions include proper input validation and exception handling.\n- The code relies solely on Python's standard libraries (`base64`, `binascii`).\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code appears benign, serving purely as utility functions.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports' confidence scores are all at 1, which aligns with the clear, standard nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are all 0, indicating no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No issues with the code logic, implementation, or security.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious features.\n- The only possible concern could be if the functions are misused in a larger context, but that is outside the scope of this utility module.\n\n**Score assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports — justified, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — confirmed, the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — the code does not introduce security risks; it's a benign utility.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- The code is safe, well-implemented, and free of security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
