  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding Base64 data, handling both string and byte inputs with proper error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 's' in encode_as_bytes and encode_as_text; 'encoded' in decode_as_bytes and decode_as_text.",
  "sinks": "Return values of the functions, which provide Base64 encoded or decoded data; no external data sinks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into encoding/decoding functions, processed via standard library calls, and results are returned; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard, and well-structured with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides four utility functions for Base64 encoding and decoding, handling both string and byte inputs with exception handling for decoding errors. It relies solely on Python's standard libraries and performs no external system interactions. The functions are correctly implemented, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The exception handling is appropriate, and the code is clear and maintainable. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and standard nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Base64 encoding and decoding utilities. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores provided in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
