  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding Base64 data, supporting conversion between bytes and text formats.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 's' in encode_as_bytes, encode_as_text, 'encoded' in decode_as_bytes and decode_as_text, input data from external sources for encoding or decoding.",
  "sinks": "Base64 encoding and decoding functions (base64.b64encode, base64.b64decode), output return values, potential data leaks if misused.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into encode_as_bytes or decode_as_bytes; processed via base64 functions; output returned as encoded or decoded data, possibly to external systems or logs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard libraries and functions with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for Base64 encoding/decoding, handling both text and bytes. It includes input validation and exception handling, without any dynamic code execution, external network calls, or access to sensitive data. The functions do not perform any suspicious operations such as logging, data exfiltration, or system modification. The code adheres to standard practices and lacks any indicators of malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of Base64 encoding and decoding utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and non-suspicious.",
