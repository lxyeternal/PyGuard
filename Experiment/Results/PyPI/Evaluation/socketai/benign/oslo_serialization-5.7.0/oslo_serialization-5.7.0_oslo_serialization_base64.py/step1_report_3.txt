  "purpose": "Utility functions to encode and decode Base64 data in both bytes and text formats.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: 's' in encode_as_bytes and encode_as_text; 'encoded' in decode_as_bytes and decode_as_text.",
  "sinks": "Base64 encoding/decoding functions that process input data and return encoded/decoded results.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into encoding/decoding functions, producing output without external data sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation. Functions perform standard encoding/decoding with error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward Base64 encoding and decoding utilities with appropriate handling for string types and errors. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No external data sources or sinks are used beyond standard library functions. The code appears to serve a benign purpose in encoding/decoding data. No anomalies or suspicious features detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements standard Base64 encoding and decoding utilities with proper error handling and type management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
