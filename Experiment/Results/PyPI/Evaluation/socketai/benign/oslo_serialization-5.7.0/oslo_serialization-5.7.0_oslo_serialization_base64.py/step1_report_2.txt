  "purpose": "Utilities for encoding and decoding Base64 data, intended for data transformation tasks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (s, encoded) in encode_as_bytes, encode_as_text, decode_as_bytes, decode_as_text.",
  "sinks": "Return values from encoding/decoding functions, potential exception handling for decoding errors.",
  "flows": "Input data (s or encoded) flows through encoding/decoding functions and returns encoded/decoded data; exception handling captures errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Functions perform standard Base64 operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard Base64 encoding/decoding functions with straightforward input validation and exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data flows. It relies on Python's base64 and binascii libraries for data transformation. No external or untrusted data sources, nor dangerous operations such as network communication or system modification are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for Base64 data encoding and decoding. It performs standard, expected operations without any malicious intent or security risks.",
