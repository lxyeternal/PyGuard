{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools with specific requirements for build tools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package setup instructions and dependencies from the setuptools.setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only contains static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with no unusual or malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls the setup() function with predefined parameters. The setup_requires dependency ensures a specific build tool version. There are no external inputs, user data, or dynamic code execution. The code conforms to standard packaging practices and contains no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
