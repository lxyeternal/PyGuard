  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing setuptools and invoking setup() with parameters for PBR configuration. It contains no user input handling, network activity, or executable code beyond package configuration. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is minimal and typical for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate and standard setup configuration file for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
