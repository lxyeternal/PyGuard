  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools with static configuration.",
  "sources": "No dynamic inputs, environment variables, or external data sources; static code with import and function call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed parameters, following common packaging practices. It contains no dynamic data, network activity, obfuscation, or embedded secrets. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
