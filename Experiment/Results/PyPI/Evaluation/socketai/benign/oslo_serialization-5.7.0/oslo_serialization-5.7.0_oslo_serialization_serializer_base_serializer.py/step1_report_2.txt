{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for serialization and deserialization of Python objects, providing method signatures for subclasses.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources directly.",
  "sinks": "None; no data or untrusted input is processed or outputted directly by this code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with method signatures for serialization tasks. It is purely declarative and does not perform any operations, data handling, or network activity. There are no embedded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated elements. The license header is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious abstract class definition for serialization interfaces. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. It serves as a foundation for subclasses to implement serialization logic.",
