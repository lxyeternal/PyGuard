{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for serializers in the oslo.serialization library to support custom (de-)serialization implementations.",
  "sources": "Import statements and class method definitions",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or external communication in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines an abstract class without execution flow or data handling",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual implementation or dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code provides a framework for serialization with abstract methods but no implementation details. It contains only class and method definitions, with no runtime or data handling. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a library for serializing objects, designed for extension by subclasses.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract class for serializers with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical component of a serialization library, providing a structure for subclasses to implement actual serialization logic.",
