  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, network, files, subprocesses, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, subprocess executions, environment variable access, and data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, environment reads, network calls, or subprocesses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Inputs are from typical sources like environment variables or user inputs, and outputs are standard. No dangerous functions such as eval or exec are explicitly used. Data flows do not indicate malicious intent. The absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or network anomalies supports a benign assessment. Confidence is high due to lack of code snippets but cautious due to potential dynamic inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It is a benign component with low security risk. Scores are consistent with the analysis, warranting no changes.",
