  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to perform a specific task, likely related to data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose cannot be determined without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly from external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Data is outputted via print statements, written to files, or sent over network connections through socket or HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from environment variables or user input flows into processing functions, which may then send data over network sockets or write to files.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated or misleading variable names or code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward with standard usage of Python libraries. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or unauthorized access. The structure suggests routine processing tasks. Without hidden or obfuscated code, the code's intent seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a standard utility or data-processing script with no signs of malware or supply chain attacks.",
