  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for string manipulation, pattern matching, and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Pattern matching with regex, input parameters for functions such as pattern and index, environment variables (warnings module).",
  "sinks": "Warnings emitted via the warnings module, string operations that could process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Pattern and index inputs -> get_pattern_context function -> warnings or string manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code mainly provides utility functions for warnings, string processing, and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions and classes for string processing, pattern context retrieval, deprecation warnings, and custom exceptions. No external data sources or untrusted data handling pathways appear to lead to unsafe operations or malicious behaviors. The warnings module is used solely for deprecation notices. The pattern context function processes input strings with regex to generate context information, which is benign. No network activity, data leakage, or harmful system manipulations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is utility-oriented, focusing on pattern processing, deprecation warnings, and error reporting without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe for use within larger projects, serving as a benign helper module.",
