  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely utility-based, involving string manipulation, pattern context extraction, and warning decorators.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are observed.\n   - The functions operate on local variables and inputs, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears well-structured, with appropriate exception handling and clear utility functions.\n   - The custom `lower()` function explicitly converts uppercase ASCII letters to lowercase, which is benign.\n   - The `get_pattern_context()` function uses regex to split pattern strings and provides contextual snippets, useful for error reporting.\n   - No logical flaws or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or very low (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature. Given the absence of external data handling or unsafe operations, this seems appropriate.\n   - **Overall:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is utility-focused and not vulnerable.\n   - No assumptions about external inputs or malicious payloads are made; the analysis is cautious and justified.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign utility module with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n   - No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a safe, utility-oriented module for pattern processing and warnings, with no signs of malware or security issues. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with my assessment.",
