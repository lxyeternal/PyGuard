  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for pattern matching, deprecation warnings, string manipulation. No external data sources, no untrusted data, no network or file operations. No suspicious behavior or malicious constructs.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely utility-based, with no evidence of malware or security issues.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — aligns with no malicious behavior.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing utility functions, pattern processing, warnings, no external dependencies, no malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity, no external data handling, no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for string case conversion, pattern context extraction, and deprecation warnings. No external data sources or network activity. Uses regex safely. No malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** All functions operate on passed-in data, with no external or untrusted sources involved.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is transparent.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, pattern processing, warnings. No external data, no network, no malicious code. Slight mention of \"securityRisk\": 0.1, possibly due to warnings or pattern processing.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is safe; warnings are standard, pattern processing is benign.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward code.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — perhaps a conservative acknowledgment that warnings could be misused if misapplied, but no actual vulnerability.\n\n**Verdict:** The small security risk score seems reasonable given the context, but could be lowered to 0 if no external inputs are involved.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for string manipulation, pattern processing, warnings, no malicious activity, no external data.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware or obfuscation. The functions are standard and safe.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is transparent.  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 — again, a conservative estimate; perhaps just acknowledging that warnings could be misused.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly zero, with a few at 0.1 for minor warnings or pattern processing, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n- No changes needed; the code is benign utility code with no security risks or malware.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or external data handling.\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the code's operations. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
