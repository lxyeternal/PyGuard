  "purpose": "Utility functions and exception classes for pattern matching, deprecation warnings, and string manipulation.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly read or handled in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause a security issue are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows or untrusted data handling pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions such as string lowering, pattern context extraction, and decorators for deprecation warnings. It includes standard regex-based text parsing and exception handling. All functions operate on local variables, do not process external inputs directly, and do not perform any network operations, file access, or sensitive data handling. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears purely utility-based with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility library focused on pattern processing and deprecation warnings. There are no indicators of malware or security risks within the provided code.",
