  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for string manipulation, pattern matching, warnings, and exceptions, including deprecated warnings and CSS selector syntax errors.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external input or data; all data used are function arguments or internal variables.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions serve as sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources are processed or propagated to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code uses standard Python features for utility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions like string case conversion (`lower`), pattern context extraction (`get_pattern_context`), and decorators/warnings for deprecation. The `lower` function explicitly converts uppercase ASCII letters to lowercase, which is benign. The `SelectorSyntaxError` class formats pattern error messages with context, useful for CSS selector parsing. The `deprecated` and `warn_deprecated` functions generate warnings for deprecated features, which is standard practice. The regex `RE_PATTERN_LINE_SPLIT` is used for pattern splitting. There are no inputs, outputs, or external dependencies that could be exploited. All functions operate on passed-in parameters without involving untrusted external sources or performing unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within this code segment.",
