  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and reasoning, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n**Summary:** Utility functions for pattern matching, string case conversion, and exception handling. No external data sources, sinks, or flows. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent.  \n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is purely utility-based, with no evidence of malware or security risks. The confidence is high (1), and the malware/security risk scores are appropriately zero.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n**Summary:** Utility functions for string manipulation, pattern context extraction, and deprecation warnings. No external input, no data leaks, no suspicious code.  \n**Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies that the code operates solely on passed parameters, with no external dependencies or malicious constructs. The confidence is high (1), and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n**Summary:** Utility functions for string processing, pattern context, and warnings. Inputs are pattern strings and indices; no external data sources or malicious behavior.  \n**Assessment:** The review correctly notes the benign nature of the code. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but justified given the utility nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n**Summary:** Utility functions for string manipulation, warnings, and error handling. Inputs are pattern strings and indices; no external data sources or malicious code.  \n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The functions are standard, with no suspicious behavior. The security risk score is slightly above zero (0.1), possibly due to the use of warnings and exception handling, but this is standard practice and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n**Summary:** Utility functions for string processing, warnings, and error reporting. No external data sources or malicious behavior.  \n**Assessment:** The detailed reasoning aligns with the code's functions. The code is utility-focused, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities. The security risk score is 0.1, which seems acceptable given the use of warnings and exceptions.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is purely utility functions—string case conversion, pattern context extraction, deprecation warnings, and custom exceptions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0 to malware and obfuscated, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, likely due to the use of warnings and exception handling, but these are standard and benign.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minor concern due to warnings and exception handling, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign utility module with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus among the reports.",
