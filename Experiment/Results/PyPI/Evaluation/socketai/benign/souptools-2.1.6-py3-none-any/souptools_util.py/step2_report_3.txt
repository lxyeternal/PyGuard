  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code details, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code provides utility functions for string manipulation (`lower`), pattern context extraction (`get_pattern_context`), custom exceptions (`SelectorSyntaxError`), and deprecation warnings (`deprecated`, `warn_deprecated`).\n- No external data sources, network activity, or untrusted input processing are present.\n- The functions operate on passed-in parameters, with no evident malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- Regex is used for pattern splitting, but only on internal strings, not untrusted data.\n- Warnings and exceptions are standard mechanisms for error reporting and deprecation notices.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No external data, no sinks, flows, anomalies, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; utility functions, no external data, no malicious constructs.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Utility functions, pattern processing, warnings, no external data or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, utility-focused code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; utility functions, pattern processing, warnings.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk (0.1) might be justified if considering the use of regex or warnings, but since these are standard and no external data is involved, this is marginal.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Utility functions, pattern handling, warnings, no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 4; the small securityRisk score is acceptable but perhaps slightly overestimated given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malware present. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly zero, with a couple of reports assigning 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, even a 0.1 might be slightly high unless considering regex or warnings as potential vectors, but these are standard features.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely utility functions, with no external data handling, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The use of regex is safe in this context; it processes internal strings.\n- Warnings and exceptions are standard and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n| Score          | Justification                                                                                   |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**    | 0 — No malicious code or payloads detected.                                                   |\n| **Obfuscated** | 0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard Python constructs.                     |\n| **Security**   | 0.1 — Slightly elevated but justified if considering regex or warnings; overall very low risk.|\n\n**In conclusion**, the code is a benign utility module with no security concerns. The minor security risk score of 0.1 could be maintained for caution but is likely overstated given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set security risk around 0.1, justified by the use of regex and warnings, but overall minimal.",
