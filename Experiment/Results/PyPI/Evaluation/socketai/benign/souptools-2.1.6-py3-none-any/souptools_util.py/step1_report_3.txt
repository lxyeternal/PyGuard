{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, pattern processing, and warnings, primarily aimed at parsing and syntax error handling.",
  "sources": "Pattern string input in get_pattern_context, pattern and index inputs for get_pattern_context, function and class decorators for deprecated warnings.",
  "sinks": "Warnings issued via warnings.warn; no direct data leaks or external network interactions; no unsafe SQL or data injection points.",
  "flows": "Pattern string processed in get_pattern_context → warnings.warn called in warn_deprecated and deprecated → potential use of get_pattern_context in exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code includes only standard utility functions, pattern processing, and warning mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for string case conversion, pattern context extraction, and deprecated warning decorators. No external data sources, network activity, or data leaks are present. The functions are straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The warning functions only issue deprecation notices without executing untrusted code or external interactions. The pattern context extraction uses regex to parse pattern strings safely, with no suspicious or malicious logic. Overall, the code appears benign, serving utility and warning purposes with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module focused on pattern processing and deprecation warnings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
