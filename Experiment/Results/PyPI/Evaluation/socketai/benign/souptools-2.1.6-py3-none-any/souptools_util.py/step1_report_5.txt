  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for string manipulation, warnings, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Pattern string inputs, function arguments, exception inputs, and module-level constants.",
  "sinks": "Warnings emitted via warnings.warn, exception raising, and string processing outputs.",
  "flows": "Pattern string inputs are processed by get_pattern_context and regex matching, warning functions emit warnings, and exceptions are raised with contextual info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of warnings and exceptions for error reporting is standard. The custom lower function implements string lowering without external input or output. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions: a cached lowercase converter, a custom exception class for CSS selector syntax errors, decorators for deprecation warnings, and a function to extract context from a pattern string for error reporting. The get_pattern_context function splits the pattern by newlines, tracks line and column info, and formats contextual snippets with indicators. No external inputs such as network, files, or environment variables are accessed. No suspicious behavior, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are apparent. The warnings are standard for deprecation notices. The code uses regex for pattern splitting but does not execute untrusted input or perform dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious intent. It handles pattern processing, warnings, and error reporting securely. No malware, data leaks, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
