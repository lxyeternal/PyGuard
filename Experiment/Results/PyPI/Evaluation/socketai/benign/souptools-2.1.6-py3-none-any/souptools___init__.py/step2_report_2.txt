  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the security implications, code behavior, and consistency of scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a wrapper around CSS selector compilation and matching, with input validation and cache management.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity, no code injection. The functions process user input safely, relying on the underlying library.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears safe. The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The malware score is correctly zero, given no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing parameter validation and safe wrapper behavior.\n- **Findings:** No evidence of malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The use of 'cp.escape' is likely safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are identified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Wrapper around CSS selector compilation with validation, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. The potential concern is untrusted patterns, but that's inherent to CSS selector processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is justified due to the possibility of maliciously crafted selectors, but no actual malicious activity is present. The malware score remains zero, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Provides an API layer for CSS selector processing with cache management.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation. The code delegates core functionality to other modules.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The low malware score is justified; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Wrapper functions for CSS selectors, with validation and safe processing.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The functions only process string patterns and HTML tags.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity, code injection, backdoors, or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are justified due to the inherent risks in processing untrusted CSS selectors, but these are low because the code validates parameters and does not execute untrusted code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code behavior and the analysis provided.\n- The low malware scores are justified; no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n- The risk scores could be slightly increased to 0.2 in some cases, reflecting the potential for malicious selector patterns, but the current scores are reasonable.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to the possibility of malicious CSS selectors, but no actual threat)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code appears secure, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation, and the low risk scores are appropriate.",
