{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to pretty-print a `SoupSieve` object for debugging purposes, transforming its string representation into a more readable format with indentation and line breaks.",
  "sources": "The source data is derived from the string conversion of the input object `obj` via `str(obj)`.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, invoke network connections, execute system commands, or handle untrusted input beyond string processing.",
  "flows": "The flow involves converting the input object to a string, then parsing and formatting this string based on regex pattern matches to produce a pretty-printed version.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs a regex-based tokenizer for specific pattern recognition within the string; however, these patterns are static and related to string formatting. No dynamic code execution, eval, or system calls are present. There are no hidden backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious control flows.",
  "analysis": "The function primarily tokenizes and formats a string representation of a complex object, which appears to be a debugging aid for `SoupSieve` objects. It uses regex matching to identify tokens like classes, parameters, brackets, and quotes, and adjusts indentation accordingly. There is no evidence of malicious code injection, data exfiltration, or external communication. The regex patterns are static, and the function operates purely on string manipulation. The design focuses on formatting, not executing or evaluating code, and does not interact with external systems or environment variables. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for pretty-printing object string representations, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply formats strings based on predefined regex patterns for debugging purposes.",
