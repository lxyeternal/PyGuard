  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward pretty-print utility for `SelectorList` objects, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0 (no security concern, benign)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs static regex-based string formatting without executing code or handling untrusted input beyond string matching. The risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code only processes string representations with regex matching, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0.1 (very low, possibly considering minimal inherent risk in regex processing)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The slight increase in security risk score (0.1) seems to acknowledge that regex matching, while safe here, could theoretically be misused if input were malicious. However, since the input is just a string representation of an object, and no code execution occurs, this is acceptable. The reasoning is solid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the function is a benign string formatter with no malicious intent.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0 (safe)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing the utility's benign nature.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0 (no security concern)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with prior reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms that the code is a safe string formatting utility with no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0 (or very close to zero)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence but still very high. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The scores are either 0 or very close to it, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All agree on no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), but given the nature of the code, this is acceptable. Regex matching on static patterns is safe here.\n- **Code Logic:** The code is a static, regex-based string formatter, with no code execution, external data handling, or network activity.\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for regex processing, but overall very low)\n\nThe code is a benign, well-scoped utility function for debugging. No security risks or malicious activity are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores assigned are appropriate given the code's behavior. No adjustments needed.",
