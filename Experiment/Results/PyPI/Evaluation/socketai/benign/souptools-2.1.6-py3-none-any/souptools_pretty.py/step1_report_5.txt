{
  "purpose": "The code is a utility function designed to pretty-print the string representation of a `SoupSieve` object for easier debugging and readability.",
  "sources": "The code reads the string output of the `SoupSieve` object, specifically using the `str()` function on the object.",
  "sinks": "The function processes and formats the string data, but does not write to external systems or perform network operations. No data is sent or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input string from `str(obj)` flows through pattern matching and formatting steps to produce a formatted, indented string output.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs complex regex patterns for tokenizing parts of the string, but no evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are detected. The regexes are solely for formatting and do not execute or evaluate untrusted input beyond pattern matching.",
  "analysis": "The code compiles a set of regex patterns for tokenizing parts of a string representation of a `SoupSieve` object. It then iterates through the string, matching tokens, adjusting indentation, and assembling a formatted output. No external data inputs are processed, nor are there any network or system calls. The function is purely for string manipulation and formatting, with no evidence of malicious activity. The approach appears to be a straightforward, non-security-related utility function. No obfuscation or hidden code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, purely formatting utility function with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It is designed solely for improving readability of a specific object’s string output. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
