{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function 'pretty' that formats a 'SoupSieve' object or similar string representations for easier debugging by adding indentation and line breaks.",
  "sources": "The primary source of input is the string representation of the object passed to 'pretty', specifically from 'str(obj)'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any operations that could lead to data leakage or security vulnerabilities. It processes and reformats a string but does not execute or evaluate untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The input string is matched against various regex tokens, and the matched substrings are used to build a formatted output with indentation. The flow is straightforward: match, process, and append to output.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely relies on regex matching and string concatenation; it does not include any unusual or suspicious behaviors such as code execution, data exfiltration, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The function performs token-based parsing of the input string to add formatting for better readability. It uses regex patterns to identify different syntax elements, adjusts indentation accordingly, and constructs a formatted string. There are no external input/output operations, network calls, or code execution. All regex patterns are static and are used only for string matching. The code appears to be a benign formatting utility without any malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility designed for improving debug output formatting of 'SoupSieve' objects. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities. It processes input data purely for display purposes without executing or transmitting data externally.",
