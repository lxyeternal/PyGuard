{
  "purpose": "A utility function to pretty-print the string representation of a SoupSieve SelectorList object for easier debugging and visualization.",
  "sources": "The string conversion of the object via str(obj), which provides the serialized structure of the SelectorList.",
  "sinks": "The regex matching and string concatenation operate solely on the string form; no external data, network, or file I/O occurs.",
  "flows": "The function converts the object to a string, then iteratively matches regex tokens to insert indentation and line breaks, building a formatted output string.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses static regex patterns for structural tokens; no obfuscation, code execution, or dynamic evaluation is present. Patterns are straightforward and serve formatting purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static regex-based formatter that enhances readability of the SelectorList's string form. It does not execute code, handle untrusted input beyond string matching, or perform any system interaction. The regex patterns are static, and the logic is simple indentation management based on matched brackets and tokens. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The function is purely for debugging visualization, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for formatting object string representations. It employs static regex patterns for indentation and line breaks, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
