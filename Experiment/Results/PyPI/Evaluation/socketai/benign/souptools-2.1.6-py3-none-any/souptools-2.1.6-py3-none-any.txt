      "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured utility for CSS selector processing with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score reflects the inherent risks of processing untrusted CSS selectors but does not indicate any code-level vulnerabilities or malicious behavior."

It employs static regex patterns for indentation and line breaks, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality."

      "obfuscated": 0.2,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The core CSS parser code is benign, but the pattern involving decoding a base64 string and executing it via 'exec' is a significant red flag indicating potential malicious behavior, such as a backdoor or remote code execution vector. The network request to a localhost URL further supports suspicion. Overall, this pattern warrants a high malware and security risk score. The code should be reviewed, sanitized, or removed to prevent potential sabotage or remote exploitation."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented version parsing utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It processes untrusted input but does so safely through validation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to input processing. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. Minor security risk score of 0.1 could be lowered to 0, but as it stands, it remains a cautious estimate. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
