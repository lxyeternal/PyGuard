{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures and classes for CSS selector parsing and representation, with no apparent functionality related to external communication, data collection, or execution of arbitrary code.",
  "sources": "Data sources include initialization parameters for various selector classes, input iterables, and external data passed during object instantiation. No explicit external input handling or user input processing is present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are absent; the code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or other data output beyond standard object representation and pickling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from object initialization parameters into internal attributes, primarily stored as immutable data structures. There are no external or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is focused on defining immutable data structures with standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines immutable classes for representing CSS selectors and related structures. It includes custom pickling support, which is standard. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms. No obfuscated code patterns or hidden malicious behavior are evident. The purpose appears to be purely data modeling and serialization for CSS selector processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of data models for CSS selectors, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe for use within its scope.",
