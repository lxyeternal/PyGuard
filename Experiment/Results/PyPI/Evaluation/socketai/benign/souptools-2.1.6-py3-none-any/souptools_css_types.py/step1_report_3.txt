{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and data structures for CSS selector parsing and representation, with serialization support.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs are read; all data is initialized internally or via parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sensitive data handling or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; data flow is limited to object initialization and attribute storage.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses advanced Python features such as custom pickling, immutable classes, and type annotations. No suspicious or malicious patterns like network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a series of immutable data classes representing CSS selectors and related structures. It employs safe practices like immutable classes, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling or network interactions. The pickling functions are standard for object serialization, with no indication of malicious intent. Overall, the structure appears to be well-designed for internal use in a larger system, without suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of data model classes for CSS selector parsing, serialization, and management. It does not contain malware or security risks, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
