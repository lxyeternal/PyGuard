{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of classes for CSS selector structures, including immutable data containers, with support for serialization and deserialization, likely used for parsing and manipulating CSS selectors in a larger system.",
  "sources": "No direct sources of untrusted data are present; the code primarily defines classes and functions for data representation.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code operates on internal data structures without external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive use of immutability and pickling registration, but no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines immutable data classes for CSS selector representation, including custom pickling support. It ensures immutability and hashability, facilitating safe storage and comparison of CSS selector structures. The import statements are standard, with no dynamic or insecure imports. The use of copyreg for pickling registration is standard and does not pose security risks. No input handling, external data processing, or suspicious behavior is present. Overall, the code is straightforward and focused on data structure definitions without any malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of CSS selector data structures with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is primarily focused on defining immutable, serializable objects used for representing CSS selectors in a larger system. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
