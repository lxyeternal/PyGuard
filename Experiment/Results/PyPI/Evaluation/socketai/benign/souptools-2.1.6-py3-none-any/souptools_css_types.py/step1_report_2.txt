{
  "purpose": "Defines immutable classes for CSS selector structures, including various selector types and supporting data structures, for use in a CSS parsing or processing library.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions (copyreg, pretty, typing). Reads class attributes and method parameters. Uses the __init__ methods to initialize class instances with data.",
  "sinks": "Uses attributes and data structures to store selector data; no direct untrusted input handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into immutable class attributes, with no external or untrusted data processing evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code detected. The use of __slots__ and custom pickling suggests optimization, not malicious intent. The import of 'pretty' and 'copyreg' is standard for serialization and debugging, not malicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of immutable classes for representing CSS selectors, with strict data encapsulation and no external I/O or network activity. It employs custom pickling functions for object serialization, which are standard in Python. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or suspicious behavior like data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code is observed. The class design focuses on data integrity and performance, not on any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of CSS selector data structures with no malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard Python idioms for immutability and serialization without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
