{
  "purpose": "Define immutable data structures for CSS selector representation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Code imports modules, class initializers, and methods that set attributes; no external input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code executes untrusted data, network connections, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow detected; code primarily defines classes and registration functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Use of custom pickling functions for class serialization is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code creates immutable data classes for CSS selector components, including registration for pickling. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The classes do not process external input or perform unsafe operations. The only dynamic aspect involves pickling, which is common for object serialization. No signs of code injection, credential handling, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of immutable data classes for CSS selectors, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
