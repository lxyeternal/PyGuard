{
  "purpose": "Defines immutable data classes for CSS selector components with serialization support.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, pickling registration functions, no external input handling.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; purely internal data modeling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of immutable classes representing CSS selectors, attributes, and related structures, with standard pickling registration. It does not perform external I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The use of pickling functions is standard and safe in this context. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of CSS selector data classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1 (reflecting minimal pickling-related concerns), which is appropriate given the code's nature.",
