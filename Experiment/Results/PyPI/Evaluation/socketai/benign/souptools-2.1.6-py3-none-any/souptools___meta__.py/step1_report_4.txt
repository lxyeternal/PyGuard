{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse, validate, and represent software version strings according to a custom interpretation of semantic versioning, with additional handling for pre-release, post-release, and development versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads version strings from input parameters to the parse_version function, as well as internal constants and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs version strings via the _get_canonical method, which could be used for display or logging. No direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input version string → parse_version function → regex matching and extraction → creation of Version object → validation and processing → output via _get_canonical.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is mainly focused on version parsing and validation. No network activity, file operations, or obfuscated code present. The class and functions appear well-structured and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version parsing and validation based on regex matching and class validation. The regex is used to extract version components, which are then converted to integers and validated for correctness according to predefined rules. The Version class provides comparison and string representation functionalities. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. All operations are internal and focused on version handling. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for version parsing and validation. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is straightforward, with proper validation and no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
