{
  "purpose": "This code provides a structured way to parse, validate, and represent software version numbers according to PEP 440 conventions, including handling pre-releases, post-releases, and development releases.",
  "sources": "The code reads version strings via the parse_version() function and possibly external input if the function is used with untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write data to external systems, but the parse_version() function processes version strings that could be derived from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input version string -> parse_version() function -> regular expression matching -> creation of Version object with validation -> output of canonical version string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. The code relies on standard Python libraries and constructs, with no obfuscated code, network operations, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive version parsing and validation module for semantic versioning. It uses regex to parse version strings, validates parts according to defined rules, and provides methods to determine release type and generate canonical version strings. No suspicious behaviors, such as malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors, are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-documented version handling utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate version parsing utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to process and validate version strings according to specified rules. No security threats or malware are detected.",
