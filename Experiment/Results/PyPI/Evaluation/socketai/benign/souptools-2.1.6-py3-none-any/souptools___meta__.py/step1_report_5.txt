  "purpose": "Define and parse semantic versioning (PEP 440) for a project, including handling of pre-releases, post-releases, and development releases.",
  "sources": "Regular expression `RE_VER` for version parsing, class `Version` for version object creation and validation, `parse_version()` function for parsing version strings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted external data or lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input version string parsed by `parse_version()` → validation and construction of `Version` object → output of canonical version string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present. The code performs standard version parsing and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard semantic version parsing and validation. It uses regex for parsing version strings, defines a class for version comparison, and enforces constraints on version components. No external data sources, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. No obfuscation or malware signatures detected. The code appears to be a normal, well-structured versioning utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version parsing utility with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It does not process untrusted external input beyond the parsing function, and its operations are limited to version validation and string formatting.",
