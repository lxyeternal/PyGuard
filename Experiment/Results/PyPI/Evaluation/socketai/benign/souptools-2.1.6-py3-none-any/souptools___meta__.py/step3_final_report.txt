  "purpose": "The code provides a utility for parsing, validating, and formatting version strings according to a simplified semantic versioning scheme (PEP 440).",
  "sources": "The code reads version strings from input parameters in the parse_version() function, which are then matched against a regex pattern.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any external data output, network communication, or system modifications. It only processes and returns version data internally.",
  "flows": "Input version string -> regex match -> extract components -> validation in __new__() -> create Version object -> generate canonical version string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns. The validation logic compares strings with version labels, which could be logically questionable but not malicious. No obfuscation or external calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of semantic version parsing with validation rules to prevent implicit pre-releases or post-releases with development versions. It uses regex matching to extract version components, then constructs a Version object that enforces correctness. No external system interaction, network activity, or data leaks are present. The validation logic, while potentially logically inconsistent in string comparisons, does not introduce security vulnerabilities. The code is well-structured, documented, and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented version parsing utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It processes untrusted input but does so safely through validation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to input processing. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
