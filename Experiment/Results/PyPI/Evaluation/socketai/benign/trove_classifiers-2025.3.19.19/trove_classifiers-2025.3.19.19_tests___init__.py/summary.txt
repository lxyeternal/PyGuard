  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign, with one report (Report 3) showing suspicious patterns justifying higher malware and obfuscation scores. The scores are consistent with the observed features. Further dynamic analysis is recommended for the suspicious code in Report 3 to confirm malicious intent. Overall, supply chain risk is low, with targeted caution for code exhibiting dynamic execution and obfuscation."
