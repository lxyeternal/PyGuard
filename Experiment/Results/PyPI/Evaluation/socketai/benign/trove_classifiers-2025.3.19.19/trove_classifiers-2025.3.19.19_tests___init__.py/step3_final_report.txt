  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, suspicious functions, obfuscation, and external communications.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external modules, hardcoded URLs/IPs, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "External network communication, dynamic code execution points, data leaks via environment variables or user inputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to external communication or code injection.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded URLs/IPs, dynamic code execution, external communication, high obfuscation scores.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical suspicious patterns including eval/exec and obfuscation, which are red flags for malicious intent. External communication points further elevate suspicion. Benign snippets lack these features and show straightforward logic. The scores assigned in the reports reflect these observations, with Report 3 justifiably having higher malware (0.6), obfuscation (0.8), and risk (0.65) scores. Other reports are consistent with benign code, showing low scores. Static analysis alone cannot confirm malicious activity but indicates elevated suspicion in certain patterns. The overall security risk is moderate due to the presence of eval/exec and obfuscation in Report 3, while the rest are low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign, with one report (Report 3) showing suspicious patterns justifying higher malware and obfuscation scores. The scores are consistent with the observed features. Further dynamic analysis is recommended for the suspicious code in Report 3 to confirm malicious intent. Overall, supply chain risk is low, with targeted caution for code exhibiting dynamic execution and obfuscation.",
