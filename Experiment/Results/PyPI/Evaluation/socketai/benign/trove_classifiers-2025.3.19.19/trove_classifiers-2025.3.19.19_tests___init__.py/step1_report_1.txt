  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing or utility functions. The purpose is not explicitly clear from the code snippet provided, but it does not exhibit any obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules. No external input sources are explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to console, files, or network connections. No suspicious sinks such as network communication, system modifications, or data exfiltration are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to outputs or storage locations, with no indication of untrusted data influencing sensitive sinks maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python script with clear structure. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns such as hidden backdoors, network calls to suspicious domains, or obfuscated logic. Usage of third-party libraries is normal and does not raise concerns. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no evident malware or security threats.",
