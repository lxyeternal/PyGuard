  "purpose": "Define and manage a set of package classifiers, including deprecated classifiers and their replacements, for a Python package index.",
  "sources": "Static lists of classifiers, deprecated classifiers dictionary, set creation, and list concatenation.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "The code constructs data structures statically; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external data sources are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static definition of classifier strings, including deprecated classifiers and their mappings. No user input, external data, or network communication exists. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The presence of extensive classifier lists appears to serve documentation or configuration purposes, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module defining package classifiers and their deprecated mappings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, backdoors, or security risks. It simply manages metadata for a package index.",
