  "purpose": "Static data definitions for package classifiers, including deprecated mappings.",
  "sources": "Lists, sets, and dictionaries of classifiers and deprecated classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; static data without external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static data initialization.",
  "anomalies": "None; well-structured static data with minor typographical errors in classifier names.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data structures managing package classifiers and their deprecated mappings. No dynamic code execution, input handling, network activity, or secrets are present. The data is straightforward, serving as metadata. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident, and the code cannot be exploited for security vulnerabilities in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and purely metadata management. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
