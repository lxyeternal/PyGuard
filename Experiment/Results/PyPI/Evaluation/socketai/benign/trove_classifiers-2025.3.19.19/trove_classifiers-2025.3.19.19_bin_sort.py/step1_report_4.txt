  "purpose": "The script analyzes Python source code files to check if lists, sets, and dictionaries are sorted, primarily for validation or formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename from command line arguments and reads file contents.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not process or output untrusted data or interact with external systems in a dangerous way.",
  "flows": "Reads filename -> Reads file contents -> Parses code with AST -> Checks AST nodes for List, Set, Dict -> Outputs failure status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The only output is diagnostic messages.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a filename from command line arguments, opens and reads its contents, then parses it into an AST. It walks the AST to locate List, Set, and Dict nodes, testing if their elements or keys are sorted using natsorted. It reports mismatches and exits with a status indicating failure or success. No external network, file modification, or data exfiltration occurs. The code performs a benign code quality check without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script used for validating the sorted order of container elements within Python source files. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
