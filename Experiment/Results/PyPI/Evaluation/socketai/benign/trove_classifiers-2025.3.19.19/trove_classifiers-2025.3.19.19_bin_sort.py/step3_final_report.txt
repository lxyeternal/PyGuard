  "purpose": "Static analysis tool to verify if lists, sets, and dicts in a Python file are sorted according to natural sorting order.",
  "sources": "Reads filename from command line argument, reads file contents, AST nodes for List, Set, Dict elements and keys.",
  "sinks": "Print statements indicating unsorted structures; no external data transmission or modification.",
  "flows": "File input -> AST parsing -> AST node traversal -> _test_sort comparisons -> print messages if unsorted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward static analysis on Python code to check sorting order of data structures. It uses standard libraries and an external sorting library. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The logic is clear and benign, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate. Slightly conservative risk score of 0.1 in one report can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and intended for correctness verification.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign static analysis utility with no malicious or security threats. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The scores are appropriate; minor adjustment of the security risk score to 0 is recommended for consistency.",
