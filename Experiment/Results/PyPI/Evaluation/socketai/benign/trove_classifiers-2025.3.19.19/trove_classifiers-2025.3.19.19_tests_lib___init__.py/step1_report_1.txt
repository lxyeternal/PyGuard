  "purpose": "Validate classifier strings against certain rules and deprecated classifiers for correctness.",
  "sources": "The input classifiers and deprecated_classifiers parameters provided to the trove_tester function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks, system calls, or sensitive data access observed.",
  "flows": "Input classifiers flow through validation checks; no external or untrusted data flows outside these checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs straightforward validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class and a validation function that iterates over classifiers, performing checks for structure, whitespace, private classifier prefix, stray colons, and hierarchical correctness. It also checks deprecated classifiers for conflicts and missing references. All logic is focused on input validation without any side effects, external calls, or suspicious behavior. There are no code injection points, no network or file system access, and no apparent malicious intent. The function terminates normally after validation or raises exceptions for invalid inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation routine for classifier strings and deprecated classifiers, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It is a straightforward, well-contained validation function with no security risks detected.",
