  "purpose": "Validate classifiers and deprecated classifiers for structure and consistency",
  "sources": "Input parameters: classifiers and deprecated_classifiers",
  "sinks": "Raise exceptions for invalid classifiers, print success message",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Validation checks -> Exceptions or print statement",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual or misleading code, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception and a validation function. It iterates over classifiers, splitting strings, checking for structure, whitespace, and invalid characters. It ensures all parent classifiers are present and that deprecated classifiers do not overlap with current classifiers, also verifying that deprecated references exist. The flow is straightforward, with validation logic and exception raising for invalid cases. No input/output manipulation or network activity is present. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward validation utility with no malicious behavior. It performs structural checks on classifier strings and cross-validates deprecated classifiers. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful side-effects.",
