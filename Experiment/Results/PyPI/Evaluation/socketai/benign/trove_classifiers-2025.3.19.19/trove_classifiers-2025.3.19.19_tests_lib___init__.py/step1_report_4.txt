{
  "purpose": "This code validates a list of classifiers and deprecated classifiers to ensure they conform to specific formatting rules and consistency checks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'classifiers' and 'deprecated_classifiers' provided to the function; the function processes these lists directly.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data outputs. No network, file, or environment variable access occurs.",
  "flows": "The function processes classifiers from input, performs various validation checks, and raises exceptions if rules are violated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code primarily performs straightforward string validation and list checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class and a validation function that iterates over classifier lists. It performs checks for structural validity, presence of parent classifiers, whitespace, private classifier prefixes, stray colons, and conflicts between deprecated and active classifiers. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. No data leaks, code injections, or external communications are present. The use of print statement is benign and for status output only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard validation routine for classifier strings and deprecated mappings, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
