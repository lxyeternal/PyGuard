  "purpose": "This code validates classifier strings for structure, hierarchy, whitespace, private prefixes, and deprecated references to ensure correctness and consistency.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'classifiers' and 'deprecated_classifiers' (list and dict inputs).",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; only raises exceptions or prints success message.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through string splitting, hierarchy checks, and cross-referencing; no external data flow or system interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward validation logic with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation checks on classifier strings, including hierarchy validation, whitespace, private prefix, and colon checks. It cross-references deprecated classifiers to ensure no overlap and that deprecated references exist. No external I/O, network, or system modifications are present. The logic is simple, deterministic, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The exception handling is standard for validation routines. The code is transparent and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward validation utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safety; no issues or vulnerabilities are present.",
