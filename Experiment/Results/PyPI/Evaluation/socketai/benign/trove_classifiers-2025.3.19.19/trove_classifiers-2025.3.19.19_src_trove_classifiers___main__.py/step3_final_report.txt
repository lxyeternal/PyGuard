  "purpose": "Import and display a list of classifiers from the 'trove_classifiers' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'trove_classifiers' module, iteration over 'sorted_classifiers'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs data to standard output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported 'sorted_classifiers' list to the 'print' function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static import and straightforward iteration and printing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a static list and prints each element. No dynamic code execution, external data sources, or suspicious constructs are present. The 'trove_classifiers' package is a standard, trusted package used for Python package metadata. The data flow is benign, from a static variable to output. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The code's simplicity and reliance on a known package suggest a benign intent. The print statement outputs static data, with no indication of data leakage or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and performs a straightforward import and print operation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
