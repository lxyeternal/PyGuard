  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low to moderate risk, with most code being benign. Obfuscation and dynamic behaviors in some reports justify higher suspicion scores. The existing scores are appropriate; minor confidence adjustments for report 5 can improve accuracy. No significant issues or contradictions are present."
