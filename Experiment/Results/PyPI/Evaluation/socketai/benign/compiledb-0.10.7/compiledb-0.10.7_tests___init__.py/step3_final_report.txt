  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, system commands, data transmission.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, environment variables, user input, or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, misleading variable names, inconsistent or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with straightforward structure, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns, supported by high confidence scores. Reports 4 and 5 show some suspicion: report 4 has moderate obfuscation and low malware score, while report 5 exhibits high obfuscation, dynamic behavior, and elevated suspicion. Scores are generally consistent with observations, with slight adjustments recommended for report 5's confidence level. No overt malicious actions are confirmed; obfuscation and dynamic features are red flags but not definitive proof of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low to moderate risk, with most code being benign. Obfuscation and dynamic behaviors in some reports justify higher suspicion scores. The existing scores are appropriate; minor confidence adjustments for report 5 can improve accuracy. No significant issues or contradictions are present.",
