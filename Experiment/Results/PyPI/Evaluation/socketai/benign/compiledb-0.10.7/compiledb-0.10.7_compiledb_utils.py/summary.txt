  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for executing system commands, with a security concern stemming from the use of 'shell=True' without input validation. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main risk is command injection if external, untrusted inputs are passed directly. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.5). Developers should validate inputs or avoid 'shell=True' to mitigate risks."
