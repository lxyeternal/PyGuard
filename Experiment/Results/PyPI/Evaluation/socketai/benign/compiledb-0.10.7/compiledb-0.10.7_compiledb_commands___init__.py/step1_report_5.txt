{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, imported modules, or environment variables, although specific source points are not explicitly shown due to lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, file writes, network requests, or system calls, but no explicit sink points are identifiable from the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input or environment) through processing functions, potentially leading to sinks like output, file, or network, but exact paths cannot be confirmed without more code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are evident. The code structure appears typical and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Given the absence of visible code, the analysis is limited. No malicious patterns, suspicious functions, or anomalies are detected. The code appears benign, with standard usage of Python features. Without additional context or specific code snippets, no indicators of malicious behavior are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal Python script, but due to the lack of actual code content, this assessment has low confidence.",
