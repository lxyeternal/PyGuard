{
  "purpose": "This code imports the pytest testing framework, likely used for writing and executing tests within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import pytest' reads the external testing library; no other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or security effects; the code does not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely imports a library without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for a well-known testing library, pytest. There are no functions, data processing, or external data interactions. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious constructs indicate benign intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Given the absence of malicious or risky elements, the code is considered safe with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a standard import statement for pytest. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0, and high confidence in this conclusion.",
