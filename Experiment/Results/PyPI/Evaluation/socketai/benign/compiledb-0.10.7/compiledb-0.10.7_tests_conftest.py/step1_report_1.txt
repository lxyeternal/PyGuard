{
  "purpose": "The code imports the pytest testing framework, likely for running tests within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement for the 'pytest' library.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow can be established from a single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of an import statement with no additional logic, which is typical for a testing setup. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, only importing pytest, a common testing library. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious constructs. Since it's only an import, it doesn't execute any malicious actions or contain malicious code. The lack of other code elements means no malicious behavior or security risks can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply importing a standard testing library with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
