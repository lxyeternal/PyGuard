  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as no input or data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for pytest. This is a common practice in Python testing scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code. Since this is just a single import, it provides no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign and appears to be a standard import statement for testing purposes. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
