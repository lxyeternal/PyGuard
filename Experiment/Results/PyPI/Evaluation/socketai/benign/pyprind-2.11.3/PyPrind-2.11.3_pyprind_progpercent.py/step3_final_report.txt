  "purpose": "A progress indicator utility that visualizes iteration progress, optionally tracking time and system resources.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, progress calculations, and system resource metrics via psutil if enabled.",
  "sinks": "Outputs progress percentage, elapsed time, and ETA to standard output streams.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (parameters, resource metrics) flow into formatted output streams for display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of try-except for psutil compatibility is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward progress bar with optional system monitoring. It uses standard libraries and reputable dependencies. No malicious patterns, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The resource monitoring features are optional and benign. The code structure is clear, and the logic is standard for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured progress indicator with optional resource monitoring. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal concern due to optional resource monitoring features.",
