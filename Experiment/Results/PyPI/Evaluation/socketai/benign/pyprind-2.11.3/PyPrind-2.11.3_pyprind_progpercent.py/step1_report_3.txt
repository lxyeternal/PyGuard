{
  "purpose": "This code defines a progress indicator utility for visualizing iterative computation progress in Python, including optional resource monitoring.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pyprind.prog_class' and access to 'psutil' attributes for monitoring CPU and memory usage.",
  "sinks": "Output to console streams (stdout/stderr), formatted string outputs, and potentially resource data if monitoring is enabled.",
  "flows": "Initialization may call resource monitoring methods, which, if enabled, access system metrics; output methods generate and flush progress updates to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code are present. Use of try-except for compatibility with older 'psutil' versions is standard. No unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily extends a progress indicator class, adding features like time tracking and resource monitoring. It conditionally calls 'psutil' methods if monitoring is enabled. Output formatting and flushing are straightforward. No external data leaks, code injection points, or suspicious activities are observed. The resource monitoring uses system calls but does not transmit data externally. No malicious patterns or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility for visual progress indication with optional resource monitoring. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious components.",
