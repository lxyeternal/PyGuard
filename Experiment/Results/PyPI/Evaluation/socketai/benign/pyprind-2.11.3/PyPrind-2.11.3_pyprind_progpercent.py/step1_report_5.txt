{
  "purpose": "A Python utility for visualizing progress in iterative computations with optional system monitoring.",
  "sources": "Imports from external library 'pyprind.prog_class' and 'time' module; constructor parameters; internal method calls.",
  "sinks": "Output to streams (stdout or stderr), potential use of system monitoring functions (cpu_percent, memory_percent).",
  "flows": "Initialization uses input parameters and external library; progress updates flow from internal calculations to stream output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious logic; external dependencies are common and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a progress indicator class inheriting from an external progress class, with methods for updating progress and optionally monitoring system resources. It uses standard library modules and an external package. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident. Output streams are controlled via parameters; system monitoring calls are protected with exception handling. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign progress indicator utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on legitimate external dependencies and performs typical progress reporting functions.",
