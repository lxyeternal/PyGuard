  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a progress indicator utility that extends a base class from 'pyprind.prog_class', with optional resource monitoring via 'psutil'.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and reputable external dependencies.\n- The monitoring functions are optional and used appropriately.\n- No external data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious behaviors are indicated.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence Confirmation**\n\n- The code itself is a benign progress indicator utility. No malicious or suspicious code is present.\n- The resource monitoring calls (`cpu_percent()`, `memory_percent()`) are standard, with exception handling for older 'psutil' versions.\n- No external untrusted data sources or sinks are involved beyond standard output streams.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and analysis.\n- They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n- The reasoning is consistent and well-supported.\n\n**No significant logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### **Scores Evaluation and Suggestions**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Security Risk Score:**\n  - Reports generally assign low scores (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable considering the code's benign nature.\n  - The highest is 0.2, which is acceptable.\n  \n**Recommendation:** Scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The code is a utility for progress display, with optional resource monitoring, all standard practices.\n- No evidence of malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Malware and Obfuscated Scores**\n\n- All reports correctly assign 0 for malware and obfuscated.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Challenging Assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume that resource monitoring via 'psutil' is benign, which is reasonable.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are made without evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Consistency of Scores with Reports**\n\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's analysis.\n- The high confidence levels (mostly 0.9 to 1) are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment**\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I conclude:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to optional resource monitoring, which is standard and safe)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward utility with no security concerns.\n- The optional 'psutil' monitoring does not introduce risks; it is a common practice.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimate |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Malware           | 0              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0              |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1            |\n\n**The code is safe, benign, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.**",
