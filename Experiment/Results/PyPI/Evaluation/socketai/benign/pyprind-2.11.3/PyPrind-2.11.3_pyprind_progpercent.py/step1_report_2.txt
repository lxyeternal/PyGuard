  "purpose": "A utility class for visualizing progress of iterative computations with optional monitoring of system resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pyprind.prog_class', standard modules 'time'.",
  "sinks": "Potential output streams (stdout or stderr) for progress display.",
  "flows": "Progress updates and formatting are written to the output stream; monitoring calls may access system metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; monitoring functions are optional and require 'psutil'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a progress indicator class extending a base class, with methods for printing progress and optionally monitoring CPU/memory usage via 'psutil'. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, network connections, or code injection are present. Use of output streams and time-based updates are standard. No obfuscated code, and dependencies are from reputable sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for progress display with optional resource monitoring. No malicious behavior detected, and it relies on standard Python practices and open-source dependencies.",
