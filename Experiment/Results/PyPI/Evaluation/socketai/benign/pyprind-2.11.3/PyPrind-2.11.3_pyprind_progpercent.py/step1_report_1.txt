{
  "purpose": "A utility for displaying progress bars during iterative computations, with optional CPU/memory monitoring and time tracking.",
  "sources": "Imports from external module 'pyprind.prog_class', time module, and psutil methods if monitor is enabled.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the use of '_stream_out' and '_stream_flush' could send data to stdout/stderr; no untrusted external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Progress calculation and display flow controlled internally; no external untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of try-except for psutil attribute differences is standard. No suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a progress indicator class extending a base class, with typical monitoring features. It includes standard method calls for time and system resource monitoring, progress calculation, and output streaming. No signs of malicious data handling, code injection, or backdoors. The class relies on external 'pyprind' module and optional 'psutil' for system stats, both typical dependencies. No suspicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured progress indicator utility with optional resource monitoring. No malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The code simply manages progress display and optional system monitoring without external data exfiltration or harmful actions.",
