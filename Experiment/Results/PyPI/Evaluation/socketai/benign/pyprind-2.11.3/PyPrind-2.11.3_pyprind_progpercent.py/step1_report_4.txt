{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Python utility class for displaying a progress indicator during iterative processes, with optional resource monitoring.",
  "sources": "Imports 'pyprind.prog_class.Prog', time module, and reads constructor parameters and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Uses time.time() for time tracking, outputs to stdout/stderr, and updates internal attributes; no untrusted input sources or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Constructor initializes parent class, optionally monitors system resources, and class methods update progress display based on elapsed time and iteration progress.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; code structure is standard for a progress indicator.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for progress visualization, importing dependencies, and managing output streams and optional system monitoring. No suspicious code paths, no obfuscated constructs, and no external network or data exfiltration activities observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for visual progress tracking with optional resource monitoring, exhibiting no malicious behavior or security risks.",
