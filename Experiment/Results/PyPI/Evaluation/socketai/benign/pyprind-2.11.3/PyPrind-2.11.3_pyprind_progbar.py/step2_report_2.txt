  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the findings, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes a progress bar utility with optional psutil monitoring.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; output functions and progress calculation flow are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation detected. Usage of psutil is optional and clearly documented.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign utility code. No malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar description.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. The optional monitoring feature via psutil is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Also benign, with no security issues.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (slightly above zero due to optional psutil monitoring, but this is standard and not risky)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, just standard monitoring capability)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. The monitoring via psutil is optional.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard progress bar utility.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (standard, low risk)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. The use of process attributes for monitoring is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with no security risks.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity; the code is a standard progress indicator with optional system monitoring.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, primarily due to optional monitoring features that are standard and well-documented.\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0** (minimal security risk, primarily due to optional psutil monitoring, which is common and not inherently risky)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, open-source progress bar utility with optional system resource monitoring. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but overall, the malware and obfuscated scores should be **0**, and the risk score should also be **0** given the benign nature of the code.",
