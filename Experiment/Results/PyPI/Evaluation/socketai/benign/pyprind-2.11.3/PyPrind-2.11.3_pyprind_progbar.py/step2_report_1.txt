  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard progress bar with optional psutil monitoring.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, code is straightforward, and external dependencies are used safely.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Fully benign, trustworthy.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar progress bar, with standard libraries and optional psutil.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious code, no backdoors, benign utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2 (due to optional monitoring), Confidence=0.9.  \n**Assessment:** Still benign; the slight security risk is due to optional resource monitoring, which is common and not malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, standard progress bar with resource monitoring.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.9.  \n**Assessment:** No malicious intent, very low security risk.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with standard output functions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious patterns, benign utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=1.0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, with system monitoring optional.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Completely benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity. I agree with the given malware scores of 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports (up to 0.2), but primarily due to optional system monitoring features, which are common and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The code is a standard, open-source progress bar utility with optional system resource monitoring.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (due to optional psutil monitoring, which is common and not risky)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, benign, and suitable for open-source distribution. No adjustments needed to the reported scores.",
