{
  "purpose": "A utility for visualizing progress in iterative computations via a progress bar in the console.",
  "sources": "Import of 'floor' from math, import of 'time', import of 'Prog' from pyprind.prog_class, and parameters/attributes within the ProgBar class.",
  "sinks": "Calls to stream output functions (_stream_out, _stream_flush), and usage of time functions for update intervals.",
  "flows": "Progress calculation from _calc_percent() to _stream_out() and _stream_flush(), with optional monitoring via psutil if enabled.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a progress bar utility, inheriting from an external class 'Prog'. It manages visual progress updates, optional CPU/memory monitoring, and output streams. No data leakage, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code relies on external libraries (math, time, psutil), with safe usage patterns. The only potential concern is the optional monitor feature requiring 'psutil', but that does not constitute malicious activity.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be legitimate utility code for user interface purposes with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign progress indicator utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected functions without any suspicious operations or data handling that could compromise security.",
