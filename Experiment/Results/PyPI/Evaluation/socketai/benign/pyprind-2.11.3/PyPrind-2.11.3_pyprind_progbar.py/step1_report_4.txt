  "purpose": "A utility class for displaying a progress bar in the terminal during iterative computations, with optional monitoring of system resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'math' and 'pyprind.prog_class', usage of class attributes, and methods that perform calculations and output formatting.",
  "sinks": "Calls to '_stream_out' and '_stream_flush' methods for outputting the progress bar to the console or specified stream.",
  "flows": "Progress calculation from '_calc_percent' to '_cache_progress_bar', then output through '_stream_out' and '_stream_flush' methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Use of system resource monitoring via 'psutil' is optional and standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network connections observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a progress bar class extending a base 'Prog' class, intended solely for user interface purposes. It uses standard library functions and conditional resource monitoring. Output functions are designed to display progress updates without any malicious side effects. No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified. No data leaks, credential use, or code injections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for visual feedback during long-running processes. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a standard implementation with no unusual behaviors or obfuscation.",
