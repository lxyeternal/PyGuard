  "purpose": "A progress bar utility with optional system resource monitoring, designed to visualize iterative computations in the terminal.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for iterations, optional psutil system metrics, output streams for progress display.",
  "sinks": "Standard output streams for progress updates; optional system info collection via psutil.",
  "flows": "Progress calculation from iteration count to display; optional resource metrics gathering; output functions display progress and system info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of optional psutil monitoring is standard and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward progress bar with optional CPU and memory monitoring. It uses standard libraries and external trusted modules. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The optional monitoring feature does not introduce security risks in this context. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical of open-source utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard progress indicator utility with optional system monitoring. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score can be confidently set at 0.1 due to the benign nature of optional system monitoring features.",
