{
  "purpose": "The code implements a progress bar utility for visualizing iteration progress in command-line interfaces, with optional system monitoring features.",
  "sources": "User-defined parameters such as iterations, track_time, width, bar_char, stream, title, monitor, update_interval; potentially external modules like psutil (if monitor is True).",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output or error streams; formatting progress bar strings.",
  "flows": "Inputs from user parameters -> progress calculations and formatting -> output stream (stdout/stderr) updates.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code contains standard progress bar functionality and optional psutil monitoring, which is common for system monitoring features.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class for a command-line progress bar with optional system resource monitoring. It imports only necessary modules, such as math and time, and a class from a trusted library (pyprind). The code manages progress display, width adjustments, and optional resource monitoring via psutil. No code injections, obfuscated code, or malicious network activities are present. Usage of psutil is optional and documented, not hidden. All operations are straightforward and typical for a progress indicator utility.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a progress bar with optional system monitoring. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. It appears safe and trustworthy based on the review.",
