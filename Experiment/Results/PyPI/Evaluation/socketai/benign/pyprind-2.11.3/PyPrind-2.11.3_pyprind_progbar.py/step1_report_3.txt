{
  "purpose": "A Python utility for visualizing progress bars during iterative computations, primarily used for user feedback in scripts or applications.",
  "sources": "Imports 'floor' from math, and 'Prog' from pyprind.prog_class; uses class initialization parameters; potentially reads data from 'iterations' and 'update_interval'.",
  "sinks": "Methods like '_stream_out' and '_stream_flush' output progress updates to stdout or stderr streams; no untrusted input directly processed but output streams are involved.",
  "flows": "Progress calculation flows from '_calc_percent()' to '_print()' which updates the progress bar display via '_cache_progress_bar' and output streams.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. Uses standard libraries and patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward progress bar utility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a progress bar class extending an imported base class 'Prog', with functions to adjust display width, cache progress, and output updates. It manages stream output and optionally monitors system resources via 'psutil'. No dynamic code execution, no hidden backdoors, and no suspicious network activity. All methods and attributes serve standard progress bar functionality. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or anomalous behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured progress indicator utility. No malicious intent, no security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate open-source package component for visual feedback during iterative processes.",
