  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Progress bar utility with optional system monitoring.\n- Source: User parameters, external modules (pyprind, psutil).\n- Sink: Output streams.\n- Flows: Standard progress calculation and output.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, well-structured, no suspicious behaviors.\n- Conclusion: Safe, trustworthy, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar progress visualization with system monitoring.\n- Source: Standard libraries, external 'Prog'.\n- Sink: Output functions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical implementation, optional psutil monitoring, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility, no security issues.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (slightly higher due to optional monitoring), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Progress bar for iterative processes.\n- Source: Similar to above.\n- Sink: Output streams.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard, no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe utility.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Terminal progress display.\n- Source: Standard libraries, external 'Prog'.\n- Sink: Output streams.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical implementation, no suspicious behaviors.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Progress bar with optional system resource monitoring.\n- Source: Standard libraries, external 'Prog', process attribute for monitoring.\n- Sink: Output streams.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Uses standard system monitoring via psutil, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious behavior, no code injections, or suspicious network activity. The code is a standard progress bar utility with optional system monitoring, which is common in open-source tools.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n**Security Risk Score:** Very low, as the code performs benign UI functions, with optional monitoring that does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the optional 'psutil' monitoring, which, if misused, could potentially leak system info. However, in the context of this code, it is standard and controlled.\n- No claims or evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned (mostly 0 for malware and obfuscated, very low for security risk) are appropriate.\n- Given the evidence, I would keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- The security risk remains minimal; I would assign a value close to 0, perhaps 0.1 at most, but 0 is acceptable.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (due to optional monitoring, but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard progress indicator utility with no malicious or obfuscation concerns. It is safe for use in open-source projects.",
