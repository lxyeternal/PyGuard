  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of a command-line progress bar with optional system resource monitoring.\n- It imports standard libraries (`math`, `time`) and a class from an external, trusted library (`pyprind.prog_class.Prog`).\n- The optional monitoring uses `psutil`, which is a common system monitoring package.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- Output functions (`_stream_out`, `_stream_flush`) are standard for displaying progress.\n- No external network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Individual Report Review**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Clear; progress bar with optional system monitoring.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, code is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious patterns, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk is slightly above zero due to optional psutil monitoring, which is common. No actual security threat. The score seems reasonable, but perhaps slightly conservative. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar findings.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. The low securityRisk reflects the optional monitoring feature, which is not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar conclusions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar findings.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to optional `psutil` monitoring, which is benign but could be misused if misconfigured.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** All 0, accurate.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports due to optional monitoring features. Given the benign nature, these are reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** High (1.0 or 0.9), justified by straightforward code review.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (reflecting optional psutil monitoring, which is common and not inherently risky)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign progress bar utility with optional system resource monitoring. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The scores assigned are appropriate, though the risk score could be marginally lowered to 0.1 to reflect the benign nature of the monitoring feature.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0. Confirm risk score at 0.1 for completeness, but overall, the code is safe.",
