{
  "purpose": "The code provides a progress bar utility for visualizing iterative computations in Python, mainly for user interface feedback during long-running processes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'floor' from math, 'Prog' from pyprind.prog_class, and 'time' module; class constructor parameters; process attribute access (cpu_percent, memory_percent, get_cpu_percent, get_memory_percent).",
  "sinks": "Methods that output to streams (self._stream_out, self._stream_flush) for displaying progress updates; potential if stream is set to untrusted external source, but defaults to stdout/stderr (stream=2).",
  "flows": "Progress calculation and output cache are updated during _print(), which calls _cache_progress_bar() and _stream_out(). The process attribute is accessed during initialization if monitor=True.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of process attribute is conditional and standard for monitoring. The code performs typical progress bar functions with no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a progress bar class extending a base Prog class, intended for visual output during iteration. It includes standard methods for adjusting width, caching progress, and printing updates. The process attribute is used for system monitoring if requested, but it requires the 'psutil' package. All functions perform straightforward calculations and output formatting. No external network activity, data leakage, or malicious actions are evident. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscation or hidden code segments. The process monitoring code depends on an external package but does not include malicious behavior or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign progress indicator utility with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It relies on an external 'psutil' package for monitoring but does not perform any suspicious operations. No malicious behavior or security threats are detected.",
