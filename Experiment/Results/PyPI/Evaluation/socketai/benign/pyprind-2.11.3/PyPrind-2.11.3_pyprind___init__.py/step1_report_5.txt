{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python utility for progress indication, including progress bars and percentages, primarily for user interface feedback during long-running processes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .progbar, .progpercent, .generator_factory; no external data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; the code only imports components and sets a version string.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code is purely modular and provides imported functionality.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The version string is static and does not pose security concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to progress display components and assigns a version number. It contains no input handling, no network activity, and no executable logic beyond module imports and version declaration. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward utility module for progress indication, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-documented open-source package component.",
