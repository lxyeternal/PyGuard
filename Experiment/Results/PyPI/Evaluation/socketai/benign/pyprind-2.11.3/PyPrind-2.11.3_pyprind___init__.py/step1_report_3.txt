  "purpose": "This code provides a Python utility for progress indication, including progress bars and percentage displays, mainly for user interface feedback during long-running processes.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from relative paths (.progbar, .progpercent, .generator_factory), which likely load classes or functions related to progress display.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or data flows indicating untrusted data processing or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code imports components for progress visualization; there are no evident data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a utility module.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of module metadata, license information, and import statements. It defines a version string. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility module for progress indicators, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard open-source library component.",
