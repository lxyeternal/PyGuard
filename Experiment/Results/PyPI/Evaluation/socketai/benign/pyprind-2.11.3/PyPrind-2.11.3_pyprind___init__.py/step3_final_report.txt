  "purpose": "Package metadata and internal imports for progress indicator utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.progbar, .progpercent, .generator_factory), version string, author/license metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules; static version and metadata; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward package initialization code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py or module file containing only metadata, import statements from internal modules, and a version string. It does not process user input, perform network communication, or execute dynamic code. All imports are from local modules, indicating internal package structure. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The purpose is to provide progress indicator utilities, and the code is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward package initialization module with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
