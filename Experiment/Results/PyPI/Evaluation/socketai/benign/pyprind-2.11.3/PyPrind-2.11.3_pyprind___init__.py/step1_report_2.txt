  "purpose": "This code provides a Python utility for displaying progress indicators, including progress bars and percentages, for use in Python programs.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.progbar, .progpercent, .generator_factory). No external data sources or inputs are read directly in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks. The code is primarily for UI display elements.",
  "flows": "Not applicable: the code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code contains only module metadata, import statements, and version info.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module-level metadata such as author, license, and version. It imports components from local modules related to progress indicators. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, or network activities. The structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving as an entry point for the package.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard package initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility for progress indication, with no suspicious activity detected.",
