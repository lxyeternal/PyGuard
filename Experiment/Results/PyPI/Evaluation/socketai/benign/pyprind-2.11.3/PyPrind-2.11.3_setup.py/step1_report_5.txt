  "purpose": "Setup script for the PyPrind package, providing package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and the pyprind module; package metadata fields; long_description text.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and package setup data flow from pyprind.__version__ and static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and the package itself to extract version information. It then calls setup() with static metadata, including description, author info, URLs, package data, classifiers, and a long description. All data appears to be static, pre-defined, and intended for package configuration. No input handling, no network operations, and no code that could be malicious or obfuscating are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
