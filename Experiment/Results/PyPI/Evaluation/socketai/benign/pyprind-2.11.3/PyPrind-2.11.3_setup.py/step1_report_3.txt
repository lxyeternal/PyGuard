{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the PyPrind package, providing package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package version from pyprind.__version__, and metadata fields such as name, description, author info, URL, classifiers, and long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling. Uses static metadata and data from the package module.",
  "flows": "Source (pyprind.__version__) flows into setup configuration for versioning; package data is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The script is a standard setup.py with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, imports the package pyprind, retrieves the version, and calls setup() with package metadata. No user input, no external data processing, and no code execution beyond standard package setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no obfuscated code are present. The code is a typical setup script with well-defined static data and no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It only provides metadata for packaging and distribution of the PyPrind module.",
