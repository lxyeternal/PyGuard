  "purpose": "Setup script for the PyPrind package, a Python utility for progress indicators and progress bars.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools', 'find_packages', and 'pyprind' module; reads version from 'pyprind.__version__'; reads metadata from the script content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network, file system, or environment variable interactions present in the code.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily imports modules and defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard setup script with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration, importing necessary modules, defining package metadata, and configuring distribution parameters. It uses standard practices with no embedded or suspicious code. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The code solely defines package information and metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It is a standard, benign package setup configuration.",
