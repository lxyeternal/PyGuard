{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging the PyPrind Python project, defining metadata and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version from pyprind.__version__ and static package metadata; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects; the script only configures package installation parameters.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, retrieving version info, and passing static data to setup(), with no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical, static setup configuration for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. It imports 'setuptools' and 'pyprind' solely to obtain version info, then calls 'setup()' with static metadata. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's static, straightforward structure.",
