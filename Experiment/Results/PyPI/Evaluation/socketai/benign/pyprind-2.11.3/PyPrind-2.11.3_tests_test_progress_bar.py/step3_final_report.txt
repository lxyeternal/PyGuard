{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of the pyprind progress bar library with various configurations and features.",
  "sources": "Internal data sources such as range() and list of items; no external input or data.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to sys.stdout and print statements; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Internal data (range, list) flows into progress bar updates and stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured demonstration of the pyprind progress bar library. It uses standard modules and a third-party library to showcase different features such as progress updates, stream output, item tracking, custom characters, flushing, and update intervals. No external data, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The code does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs. All data flows are internal, and the purpose appears solely for testing or demonstration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very low) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is a conservative estimate but does not reflect actual risk. Overall, the code is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
