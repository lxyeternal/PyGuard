{
  "purpose": "Provides factory functions to create progress indicator generators for iterables, specifically for progress bars and percentages.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.progbar and .progpercent); uses len() on iterables",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems; no untrusted data output or network communication",
  "flows": "Input iterable -> generator yields items -> progress updates",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a higher-order function that creates generator functions to track progress during iteration, leveraging classes ProgBar and ProgPercent. It uses assertions and standard Python features. No external network, no data leaks, no obfuscated code, and no malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of progress indicator factories with no malicious intent or security risks.",
