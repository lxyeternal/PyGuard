  "purpose": "Defines factory functions to generate progress indicator generators that wrap iteration with progress updates using local classes ProgBar and ProgPercent.",
  "sources": "Input iterable 'iteritem' and optional 'iterations' parameter.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks; only local progress update calls.",
  "flows": "Generator yields items from 'iteritem' while calling 'mbar.update()' after each item.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module creating generator functions that wrap iteration with progress bar updates. It imports local classes and does not process untrusted data or perform network activity. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The logic is simple and transparent, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for progress indication with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
