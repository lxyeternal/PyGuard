{
  "purpose": "Defines factory functions to create progress indicator generators using classes ProgBar and ProgPercent for visual progress updates during iteration.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.progbar and .progpercent), input parameter 'iteritem' in generator_progress function.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leakage, system impact, or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Input iterable 'iteritem' flows through generator_progress, which yields items and updates progress bars.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. The code appears standard for a progress indicator utility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a higher-order function 'generator_factory' that takes a class (mother_class) and returns a generator function. The generated function iterates over 'iteritem', yielding each item and updating a progress bar instance. No user input or untrusted data sources are processed in a risky manner. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The code is straightforward, with clear intent for progress tracking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for progress tracking in Python. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation for generator-based progress bars.",
