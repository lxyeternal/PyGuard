{
  "purpose": "The code provides factory functions to create progress indicator generators, specifically for progress bars and percentages, likely used during iteration in larger programs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input iterables through generator functions and uses class instantiation with arguments.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input iterables are passed into generator_factory, which yields items and updates progress indicators; no external data flow or network activity is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears straightforward and intended for progress display.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a higher-order function to create generators that wrap iteration over input data, updating a progress indicator object each time. It imports two classes, ProgBar and ProgPercent, which are used as progress indicator implementations. The functions are simple, with no external input processing or data transmission, and no malicious or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for progress reporting, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
