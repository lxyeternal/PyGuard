{
  "purpose": "Defines factory functions to create progress indicator generators using ProgBar and ProgPercent classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.progbar and .progpercent), input data via generator_factory parameters.",
  "sinks": "Yielding items from iteritem, updating progress bars internally; no direct sinks of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input iterables flow through generator_factory, which yields items after processing, and updates progress bars.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a factory function that generates progress indicator generators. It imports progress classes, defines a nested generator function that updates progress bars, and creates two specific generator functions. The structure is straightforward with no signs of malicious behavior. No external data handling, no network calls, no cryptographic operations, and no suspicious code paths are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for progress tracking, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
