  "purpose": "Define factory functions for creating progress indicator generators using provided classes ProgBar and ProgPercent.",
  "sources": "Import statements and function parameters (mother_class, iteritem, iterations, args, kw).",
  "sinks": "The code does not have explicit sinks for untrusted data, but it yields items from iteritem which could be untrusted input if used insecurely elsewhere.",
  "flows": "generator_factory receives a class, creates a generator that iterates over iteritem, updates progress bar, and yields items.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external calls, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple factory pattern to generate progress indicator functions, wrapping iteration with progress updates. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. It is a straightforward utility implementation for progress visualization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for progress display with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
