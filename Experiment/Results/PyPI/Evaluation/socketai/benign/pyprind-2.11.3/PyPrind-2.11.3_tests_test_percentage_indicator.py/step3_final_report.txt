{
  "purpose": "Demonstration and testing of the pyprind progress indicator library through various progress update scenarios.",
  "sources": "Predefined variables, progress indicator instantiations, sleep delays, standard output streams.",
  "sinks": "Standard output (stdout), no untrusted data sources or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Progress indicator updates flow from function calls to stdout; no external data or network flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and pyprind, defines multiple test functions that simulate progress updates with sleep delays, and outputs to stdout. It does not process untrusted data, perform network activity, or contain obfuscation. All behaviors are consistent with a benign demonstration script. No security vulnerabilities, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward demonstration utility for the pyprind library. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and does not process sensitive data. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
