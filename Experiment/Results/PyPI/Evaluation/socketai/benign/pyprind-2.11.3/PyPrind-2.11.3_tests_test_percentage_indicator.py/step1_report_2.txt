  "purpose": "Utility script for demonstrating and testing the functionality of a Python progress indicator library (pyprind).",
  "sources": "Reads static data such as n=100, sleeptime=0.02, and input range for progress simulation.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to sys.stdout, prints progress information, and calls library functions.",
  "flows": "Reads input variables, passes them to pyprind functions, which generate progress indicators, then outputs to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious activity observed. The code mainly calls external library functions for UI feedback.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward demonstration and test suite for a progress indicator library. It uses standard Python modules (sys, time) and a third-party library (pyprind). All functions perform progress updates with simulated delays. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity is present. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected. The code does not perform any sensitive operations or interact with environment variables beyond standard output streams.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration script for a progress indicator utility. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely uses standard and third-party libraries for user interface feedback in the console.",
