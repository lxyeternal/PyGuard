{
  "purpose": "A utility script for demonstrating and testing a Python progress indicator library (pyprind).",
  "sources": "Reads data from standard input/output streams, imports sys, time, and the pyprind library.",
  "sinks": "Uses sys.stdout for output; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Imports data from standard streams and external library; flows are primarily local function calls with sleep delays.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple test functions that instantiate and exercise the pyprind progress indicator library, with standard sleep delays. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious code observed. All imported modules are standard or well-known. No obfuscation or hidden behavior detected. The code’s purpose is to demonstrate library functionality with typical I/O operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for testing a progress bar library. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It solely performs local operations and standard I/O tasks.",
