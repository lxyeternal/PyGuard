{
  "purpose": "The code is a utility script for demonstrating and testing the functionalities of the pyprind progress indicator library.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, time, and pyprind; user-defined functions calling pyprind classes and methods; main execution block calling test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command execution are present. The code only prints to standard output and calls library functions.",
  "flows": "The script initializes progress indicators and updates them in loops with sleep delays, printing progress updates to stdout. No untrusted data flows from external sources into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and intended for demonstration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines multiple test functions to showcase features of the pyprind progress bar library. It uses controlled loops with sleep intervals to simulate progress updates and prints outputs for visualization. The main block executes all test functions sequentially, with no external data ingestion beyond standard imports and predefined variables. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or security risks. Usage of pyprind is purely for progress indication, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign demonstration utility for a progress indicator library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or security vulnerabilities. It simply tests and showcases the pyprind library features, with no external data leaks or malicious actions.",
