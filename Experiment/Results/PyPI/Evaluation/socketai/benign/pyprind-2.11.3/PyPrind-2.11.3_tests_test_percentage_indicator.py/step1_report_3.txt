  "purpose": "Utility script for demonstrating and testing the functionality of the pyprind Progress Indicator package.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the range() iterator, string formatting, and standard input/output streams.",
  "sinks": "Outputs progress updates to sys.stdout and console via print statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from range() or list of items to progress indicator updates, then to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious strings, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious intent observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the pyprind package to create progress indicators for various test scenarios. It simulates progress updates with time.sleep(), printing status to stdout. All data sources are safe and controlled. No data leakage, external network connections, or suspicious activity is detected. The code only demonstrates functionality of a known open-source package without modifications or malicious injections. The presence of multiple test functions and print statements indicates a testing/demo purpose rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for testing the pyprind progress indicator package. It performs no malicious activity or security-sensitive operations. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
