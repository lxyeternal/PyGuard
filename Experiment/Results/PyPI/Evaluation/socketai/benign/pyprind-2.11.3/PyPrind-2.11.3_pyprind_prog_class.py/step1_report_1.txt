{
  "purpose": "A utility for displaying progress indicators during iterative processes in Python, including features for monitoring system resources.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), system streams (sys.stdout, sys.stderr), and potentially system information via psutil.",
  "sinks": "Output streams for printing progress, system resource data (CPU, memory) via psutil, and environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system streams influence output; system info is retrieved via psutil and printed to output streams.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes resource monitoring features that access CPU and memory usage. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code is well-structured and typical for a progress bar utility, with no obfuscated code, malicious logic, or unusual data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a progress bar with optional system resource monitoring. It safely checks for environment variables and stream support, and uses psutil only if available for monitoring. No suspicious or malicious activities are detected. The only notable features are resource monitoring and output handling, which are legitimate in the context of a progress indicator. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity are present. The structure and logic are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden code. Overall, the code appears benign and consistent with its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate progress indicator utility with optional system resource monitoring. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The features are typical for such utilities, and there are no signs of malware or suspicious activity.",
