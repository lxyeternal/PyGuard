  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a progress indicator with system monitoring, reading environment variables, streams, and psutil.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activities, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation. The code's features (progress bar + resource monitoring) are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, no malicious behavior, confidence 1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is a typical progress indicator with optional resource monitoring, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, emphasizing progress tracking and resource monitoring.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no data exfiltration, no backdoors. Resource monitoring via psutil is common.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with detailed flow description.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code. psutil use is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the code as a typical progress utility with resource monitoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general description.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no exfiltration, no backdoors. Uses psutil appropriately.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, emphasizing transparency.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard resource monitoring.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — suitable.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code described in all reports matches the provided source; no issues or suspicious behavior are present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the potential for resource info to be sensitive, but no actual security concern.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero, perhaps around 0.1–0.2, reflecting that resource info could be sensitive, but no actual risk exists.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (due to resource info exposure potential, but no actual risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code is a standard progress indicator with optional system resource monitoring, with no malicious or suspicious features.",
