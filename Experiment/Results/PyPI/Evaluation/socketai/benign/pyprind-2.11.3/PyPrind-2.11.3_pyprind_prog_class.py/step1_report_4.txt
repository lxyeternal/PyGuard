{
  "purpose": "A utility class for displaying progress indicators during long-running processes, including optional system monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), system state (psutil, os, sys), and input parameters for progress tracking.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to sys.stdout or sys.stderr via the stream, which could be controlled externally.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> condition checks for stream support; input parameters -> stream setup; progress updates -> output streams.",
  "anomalies": "Uses psutil for process monitoring; raises error if monitor is enabled but psutil is not installed. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard progress indicator utility with optional system monitoring features. It imports psutil if available to track CPU and memory usage, but this is a legitimate use for monitoring resource consumption during long tasks. The code performs environment and stream support checks before output. It has mechanisms for estimating remaining time and displaying progress. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The only potential concern is the optional use of psutil for system monitoring, but this is a common practice and not malicious. The code appears to be well-structured and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate progress indicator utility with optional system resource monitoring. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It functions as intended for progress display and resource tracking without any suspicious activities.",
