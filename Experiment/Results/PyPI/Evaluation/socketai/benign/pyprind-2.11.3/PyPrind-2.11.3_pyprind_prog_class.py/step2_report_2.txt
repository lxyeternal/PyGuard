  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a progress indicator utility with optional system resource monitoring.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity is detected across all reports.\n- The code relies on psutil for resource monitoring, which is a common external library.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network activity, or data exfiltration are present.\n- The code's logic and flow are standard for such utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence\n- The code snippets provided match the described functionality: progress tracking, ETA calculation, system resource monitoring via psutil, output stream handling.\n- No issues are found in the code that would indicate malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports\n- The reports' reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n- They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no obfuscation or malicious logic.\n- The mention of resource monitoring being optional and handled safely is correct.\n- No logical flaws or misleading claims are present.\n\n### Scores Review\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`, which is justified.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are very low (0 to 0.2), consistent with the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), which is appropriate given the clear benign assessment.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2, which aligns with the benign evaluation.\n- The only potential concern could be the optional resource monitoring, but it is a standard feature and not malicious.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores\n- All reports agree on 0 for malware and obfuscated, which is justified.\n- No evidence of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions\n- The reports assume that psutil is only used for resource monitoring, which is correct.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behaviors are made; the reasoning is based on code analysis.\n\n### Consistency of Scores\n- The scores are consistent with the code's functionality and the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, considering resource monitoring could be misused if exploited, but in this context, it is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured progress indicator utility with optional system resource monitoring. All evidence points to benign functionality, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set risk score around 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to resource monitoring features, which are standard and not malicious.\n\n**Work out conclusion:**  \n- The code is safe, benign, and suitable for use in production environments.",
