{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python progress indicator utility that displays progress, estimated time remaining, and system resource usage during long-running processes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.environ), system information via psutil, and standard input/output streams (sys.stdout, sys.stderr).",
  "sinks": "The code writes progress updates, titles, ETA, and system info to output streams (stdout, stderr, or custom).",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables or system info -> sink: output streams for progress updates and system metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses standard progress indicator patterns and system resource monitoring. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward implementation of a progress bar with optional system resource monitoring using psutil. It reads environment variables to detect terminal support, uses standard system modules, and outputs progress info. No hidden or malicious activities are evident. The code manages output streams carefully and performs expected functions without suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured progress indicator utility without any malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical progress tracking functions and system monitoring in a transparent manner.",
