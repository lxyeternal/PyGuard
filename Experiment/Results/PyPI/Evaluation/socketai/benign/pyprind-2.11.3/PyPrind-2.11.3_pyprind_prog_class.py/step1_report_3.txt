  "purpose": "A Python utility for displaying progress indicators and monitoring resource usage during iterative processes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), reads standard output and error streams, imports psutil (optional).",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout or stderr streams, possibly when printing progress or warnings.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> _check_stream() -> outputs progress info -> optional psutil resource monitoring -> outputs resource usage stats.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no hidden backdoors. The code imports psutil conditionally and handles streams carefully. The only potential anomaly is the monitoring feature requiring psutil, which is standard for resource tracking.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a progress bar with resource monitoring capabilities, updating progress and optionally printing system resource usage via psutil if available. It handles stream output carefully, with checks for supported streams. No signs of malicious payloads, external data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. No unusual or suspicious code constructs are found. The code performs standard progress reporting and system resource monitoring functions without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign progress indicator utility with optional system resource monitoring. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It is well-structured, with safeguards for stream support and resource monitoring. No security risks are apparent.",
