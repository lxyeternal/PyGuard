  "purpose": "A Python utility for displaying progress indicators with optional system resource monitoring.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, sys.stdout, sys.stderr, optional psutil process info",
  "sinks": "Output streams (stdout/stderr), potential data leaks if resource info is exposed",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment, system info) to output streams via print/update methods",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard progress bar with ETA and resource monitoring features using psutil. It reads environment variables and system info, outputs to streams, and manages internal state without suspicious logic. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The resource monitoring is optional and handled safely. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with typical utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured progress indicator utility with optional system resource monitoring. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
