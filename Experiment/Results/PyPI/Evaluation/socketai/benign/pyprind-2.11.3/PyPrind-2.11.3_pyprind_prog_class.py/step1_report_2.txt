  "purpose": "A utility for tracking progress in Python scripts, including optional system resource monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), system time (time), standard output/error (sys.stdout, sys.stderr), and optional psutil process data.",
  "sinks": "Writes progress information, timing, and resource usage to output streams; potential for data leaks if monitored resource info is sensitive.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables and system info flows into output streams via _print methods; progress updates are based on internal counters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code monitors system resources when psutil is available, which is standard for progress monitoring tools.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a progress tracking object, optionally monitors system resources using psutil, and outputs progress and resource usage to specified streams. It includes checks for stream support, calculates ETA, and formats timing info. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or suspicious data handling are observed. It primarily provides progress updates and system info reporting, with no network communication or data exfiltration activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign progress indicator utility intended for use in Python scripts. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its resource monitoring feature relies on psutil, which is a common external library. There are no signs of malware, data theft, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
