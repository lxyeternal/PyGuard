{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract serializer class for Avro objects, specifying methods for schema retrieval, serialization, and deserialization.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources or external data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow or data handling occurs within this abstract class; it only defines method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It uses standard Python typing, abstract classes, and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class with methods for schema handling, serialization, and deserialization related to Avro data. No implementation details are provided, and there are no external data sources or sinks. The class serves as an interface or contract for subclasses. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or security risks present. It appears to be a standard, well-documented abstract class meant for use in larger systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract class defining interfaces for Avro serialization/deserialization. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security issues are evident. It is safe and intended for structural use in other code.",
