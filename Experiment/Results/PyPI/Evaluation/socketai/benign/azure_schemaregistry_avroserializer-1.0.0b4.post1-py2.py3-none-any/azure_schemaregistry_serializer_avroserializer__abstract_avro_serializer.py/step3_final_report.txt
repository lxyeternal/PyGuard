  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for Avro serialization and deserialization, serving as a contract for subclasses.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code contains only method signatures and documentation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data handling or output occurs within this abstract class.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the class only declares method signatures without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, and standard for an abstract base class.",
  "analysis": "The code is an abstract base class with three abstract methods for schema handling, serialization, and deserialization. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as a benign interface, with high confidence and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's purpose is purely structural, and any malicious activity would depend on subclass implementations, which are outside this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign abstract class defining an interface for Avro serialization/deserialization. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
