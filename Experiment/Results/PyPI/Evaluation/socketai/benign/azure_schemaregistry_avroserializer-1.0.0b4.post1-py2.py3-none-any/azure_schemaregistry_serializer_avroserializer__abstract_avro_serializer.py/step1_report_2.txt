  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for serializing and deserializing Avro objects based on schemas.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; only function parameters and class attributes are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs to external systems are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions are abstract and do not contain executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains standard documentation and abstract method declarations without implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured abstract class defining serialization/deserialization interface for Avro schemas. It does not include executable logic, data handling, or any operations that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, external data sources, or sinks are present. The purpose is to enforce a contract for subclasses, not to perform any data processing directly.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign interface definition for Avro serialization with no malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no active code that could be exploited or used maliciously.",
