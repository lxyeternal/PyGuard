  "purpose": "Define an abstract class for Avro object serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or data acquisition is present in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is implemented; the code only defines abstract methods without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard abstract class with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and abc modules to define an abstract base class for serialization tasks. It specifies abstract methods for obtaining schema names, serializing data, and deserializing data, all with type hints and docstrings. There are no executable statements, input/output operations, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is consistent with standard design patterns for serialization frameworks. No anomalies or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract class definition for Avro serialization, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves as a template for concrete implementations.",
