{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract serializer class for Avro serialization/deserialization, serving as a base for specific implementations.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted data are present in this code; input data comes from method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data directly; methods are abstract and meant to be implemented elsewhere.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are explicitly implemented; the abstract methods indicate intended data flow for subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is clean and adheres to standard design for serialization interfaces.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract base class with method signatures for schema handling, serialization, and deserialization. No actual data processing, network communication, or file handling occurs here. It mainly defines interfaces and documentation, with no code execution or data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks in this code. It appears to be a standard, well-structured abstract class meant for implementation elsewhere. No malicious signals or suspicious patterns detected.",
