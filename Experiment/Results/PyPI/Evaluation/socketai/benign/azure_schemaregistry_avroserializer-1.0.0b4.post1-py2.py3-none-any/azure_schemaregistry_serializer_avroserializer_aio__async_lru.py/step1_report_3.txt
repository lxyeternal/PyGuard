{
  "purpose": "Implementation of an asynchronous Least Recently Used (LRU) cache for coroutine functions, primarily to optimize repeated asynchronous function calls.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, and uses asyncio event loop to manage asynchronous tasks.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs cache objects and futures, manages task completion, and potentially handles exceptions; no external data leaks or system effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Function arguments are used to generate cache keys; cached futures are retrieved or created; task completion updates cache hits/misses; cache invalidation and clearing are supported.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors are detected; standard async cache pattern. The code includes internal utility functions for cache management and asyncio task handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive async LRU cache decorator for coroutine functions, including cache invalidation, clearing, and closing mechanisms. It manages cache entries via an OrderedDict, tracks cache hits/misses, and handles asyncio tasks with proper callback setup. The code checks for coroutine functions and manages cache size. There are no signs of malicious data handling, backdoors, or unauthorized system interactions. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured caching implementation intended for performance optimization in asynchronous contexts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of an asynchronous LRU cache for coroutine functions, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It focuses on cache management and asyncio task handling, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
