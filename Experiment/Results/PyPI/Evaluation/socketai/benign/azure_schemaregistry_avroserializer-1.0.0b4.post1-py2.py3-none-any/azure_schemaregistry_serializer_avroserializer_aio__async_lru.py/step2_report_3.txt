  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues detected; the code is a standard asyncio-based LRU cache implementation.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified; the code uses internal attributes typical for such cache implementations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. These seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score reflects the benign nature of the code, and malware score is zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns; the code is a legitimate cache utility.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; similar to Report 1, a standard asyncio LRU cache.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Slightly higher but still reasonable considering the code's purpose.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the slightly higher risk score may reflect general caution but is still appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious indicators; code appears legitimate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; consistent with previous reports.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None; standard cache management.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the code is purely for cache management.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; standard asyncio cache decorator.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None; the code is a typical implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. Zero risk is justified.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; consistent with other reports.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate cache implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently indicate zero, which aligns with the code's function as a cache utility.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are zero; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard, well-structured asyncio LRU cache decorator with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate cache utility with no security concerns.",
