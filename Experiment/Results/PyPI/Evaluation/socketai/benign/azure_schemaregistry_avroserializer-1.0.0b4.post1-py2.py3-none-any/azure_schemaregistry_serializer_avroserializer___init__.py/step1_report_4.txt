{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py file, mainly for versioning and exposing the AvroSerializer class for external use.",
  "sources": "Import of VERSION from ._version and import of AvroSerializer from ._schema_registry_avro_serializer.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the code only imports and exposes classes and variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no processing of external input occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains standard package initialization and module exports without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and typical for Python package initialization files. It imports a version number and a serializer class, then exposes the serializer via __all__. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data handling is involved. There are no obfuscated parts, malicious behavior, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only sets up versioning and public API exports.",
