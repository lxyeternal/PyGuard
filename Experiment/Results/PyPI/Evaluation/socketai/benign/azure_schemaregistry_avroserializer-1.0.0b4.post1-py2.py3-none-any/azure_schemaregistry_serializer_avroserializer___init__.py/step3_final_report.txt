  "purpose": "Standard package initialization, importing version info and serializer class for export.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_version, _schema_registry_avro_serializer).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or external output.",
  "flows": "Import from local modules to module namespace; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static imports, no dynamic code, no secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py for a Python package, performing static imports and setting __version__ and __all__. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
