  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes inheriting from AzureError.\n- The code includes only class definitions with detailed docstrings, no data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity are identified.\n- The import is straightforward, and the code appears to be part of a standard SDK component.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence Confirmation:**\n- The code matches the descriptions; no issues or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The classes are standard exception subclasses, with no dynamic code or data handling.\n\n### **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic/Reasoning:**\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- No incorrect assumptions or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n### **Scores Review & Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code contains no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of any risky or malicious behavior.\n\n**Are any score adjustments necessary?**\n- No, the scores seem reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n### **Risk Score Justification:**\n- The overall risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The code is purely for exception handling, with no external or untrusted data involved.\n- No indication of vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or supply chain compromise.\n\n### **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All claims are based on straightforward class definitions; no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are justified.\n- The detailed docstrings and standard structure support the conclusion that this is safe, boilerplate SDK code.\n\n### **Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is standard, static class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No dynamic behavior, no data handling, no external communication.\n- No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The detailed documentation and straightforward structure reinforce the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify this code as safe, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This analysis assumes the code snippet provided is representative of the entire package or module. If future code introduces dynamic behaviors or data handling, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
