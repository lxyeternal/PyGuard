  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling JSON schema errors in Azure SDK",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from azure.core.exceptions import AzureError'",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "None; the code solely defines classes without data flow or processing logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or unusual behaviors detected; code is standard class definitions and comments",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard exception class and defines three custom exception classes inheriting from AzureError. Each class includes descriptive docstrings and attribute documentation but contains no executable code beyond class declarations. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward, standard Python class definitions for exception handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
