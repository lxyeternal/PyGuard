  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling JSON schema errors in Azure SDK context.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AzureError from azure.core.exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only class definitions and inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; classes are standard exception subclasses with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions inheriting from AzureError, used for error handling. No data input, output, or processing occurs. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no external communications or manipulations are present. The code appears to be straightforward, well-documented exception class definitions with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes designed for schema-related errors in an Azure SDK context. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
