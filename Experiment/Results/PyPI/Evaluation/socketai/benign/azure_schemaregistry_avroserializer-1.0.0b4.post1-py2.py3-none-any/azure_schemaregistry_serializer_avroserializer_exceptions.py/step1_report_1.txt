  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to JSON schema parsing, serialization, and deserialization in Azure SDK.",
  "sources": "No external data input; exception classes are defined statically with no data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code contains only class definitions without data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard class definitions for exceptions with docstrings and inheritance from AzureError.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from AzureError, with detailed docstrings. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity are present. The code appears to be part of a larger SDK and follows standard Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard exception class definitions used for error handling within an SDK. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation detected. The code is safe and contains no suspicious or malicious activity.",
