  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence for potential security issues, malware, obfuscation, or other risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from AzureError.\n- There are detailed docstrings describing each class's purpose and attributes.\n- No data input/output, dynamic code execution, or processing of untrusted data.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors.\n- The code appears to be part of a standard SDK, following typical Python practices.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The import statement is straightforward.\n- The exception classes are standard, with no complex logic.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or code that could be exploited.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, with no malware or security risks.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it contain any exploitable logic.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- None detected. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n**My own evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, no data handling, no vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, safe implementation of custom exception classes within an SDK. There are no signs of supply chain compromise, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code is benign and safe.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
