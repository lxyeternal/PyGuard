{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to JSON schema parsing, serialization, and deserialization within the Azure SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AzureError from azure.core.exceptions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not pass or process untrusted data; it only defines classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; classes are for exception handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears standard and well-structured with licensing comments and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with licensing and copyright notices, followed by a single import statement. It defines three custom exception classes inheriting from AzureError, each with docstrings describing their purpose and attributes. No input handling, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are observed. The structure is typical for exception class definitions in SDKs. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines custom exceptions for error handling in an Azure SDK component. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious data handling, and no signs of obfuscation or sabotage. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation.",
