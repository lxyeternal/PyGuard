{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for JSON schema parsing, serialization, and deserialization errors within the Azure SDK.",
  "sources": "Import of AzureError class from azure.core.exceptions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "N/A - static class definitions without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with detailed docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from AzureError, with comprehensive docstrings describing their purpose and attributes. There are no data inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or external interactions. The structure is standard for SDK exception classes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is static, well-documented, and follows typical Python exception patterns. The absence of data handling, network activity, or dynamic behavior indicates no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for an SDK, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
