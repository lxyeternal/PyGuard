  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes inheriting from AzureError.\n- No data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity.\n- The code appears to be standard SDK exception class definitions, with detailed docstrings.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: class definitions for parsing, serialization, and deserialization errors related to JSON schemas.\n- The import statement is straightforward and appropriate.\n- No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, no processing of untrusted data, and no external communication.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, well-documented class definitions.\n- Security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or reasoning:**\n- Since the code is purely class definitions for exception handling, there's no reason to assign a higher risk score.\n- The detailed docstrings and inheritance structure are standard and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here, as the code does not process or handle data directly.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard SDK exception classes.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear, standard class definitions)\n- Risk: 0 (no security risk in defining exception classes)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, straightforward, and standard for SDK error handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns. The current scores are justified and should remain as is.",
