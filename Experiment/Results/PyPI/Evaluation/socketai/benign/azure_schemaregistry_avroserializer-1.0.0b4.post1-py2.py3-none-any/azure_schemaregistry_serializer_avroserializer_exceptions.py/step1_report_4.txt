{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JSON schema parsing, serialization, and deserialization errors in the Azure SDK.",
  "sources": "Import from 'azure.core.exceptions'. No user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or output. Exception classes do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code only defines classes; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions inheriting from AzureError, with detailed docstrings. It appears to be part of a larger SDK for handling JSON schema errors. The structure and content are standard, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with comprehensive documentation. It poses no security threats, no malware, and is typical for SDK error handling. No suspicious activity detected.",
