  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from AzureError.\n- All reports agree that there are no data flows, no input/output handling, no dynamic code, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The code includes standard licensing comments, import statements, and detailed docstrings.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity are detected.\n- The purpose appears to be defining error classes for an SDK, which is typical and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of the code is benign and standard.** No issues are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **None detected.** The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to Python conventions for exception classes.\n\n### Scores given in reports:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (correct)\n\nThese scores are reasonable given the content.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely class definitions with no dynamic behavior, no data handling, and no external communications, the risk score of 0.5 or higher is unjustified.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The detailed docstrings and standard structure further support a low risk profile.\n\n### Challenged claims:\n- Any suggestion that this code could be malicious or pose a security threat is unfounded based on the static, descriptive nature of the code.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as standard SDK exception classes.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports correctly assign zero to obfuscated, malware, and security risk scores.\n- The confidence score of 1 is justified, given the clear and standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated overall security risk:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-documented set of custom exception classes for an SDK, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The detailed analysis confirms the absence of any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
