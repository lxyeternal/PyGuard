  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes inheriting from AzureError.\n- The code consists solely of class definitions with detailed docstrings.\n- No data input/output, dynamic code execution, or data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard SDK exception class definitions.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Report 1\n- Confirms no data flow, anomalies, or malicious activity.\n- **Malware score: 0** — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — correct.\n- **Risk score: 0** — appropriate; no security risk.\n\n### Report 2\n- Similar findings; standard class definitions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware: 0** — correct.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — correct.\n- **Risk: 0** — appropriate.\n\n### Report 3\n- Same conclusion; no issues detected.\n- **Malware: 0** — correct.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — correct.\n- **Risk: 0** — appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- Consistent with previous; standard exception classes.\n- **Malware: 0** — correct.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — correct.\n- **Risk: 0** — appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- Same analysis; no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware: 0** — correct.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — correct.\n- **Risk: 0** — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. The code is purely class definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since there is no evidence of security risks, data leaks, or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard SDK exception classes with no security issues. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
