  "purpose": "The provided code appears to define a software version string and includes a standard open-source license header.",
  "sources": "The license header comments, and the assignment of the VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present, as the code only contains comments and a single variable assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists beyond the static assignment of VERSION.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code segments; the code is straightforward and contains only comments and a simple variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing information and a version string variable assignment. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The license block is standard and does not contain any executable or malicious code. The VERSION variable is statically assigned with a non-sensitive string. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily consisting of licensing comments and a version declaration. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues.",
