  "purpose": "Declare software version information and include license header comments.",
  "sources": "Static license comments and version string assignment",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "None; static code with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; standard license header and version assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license header comment and a single assignment of a version string. There are no input handling, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical for open-source projects and does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license header and version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
