  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a license header and a simple version string assignment.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and typical for open-source projects.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippet contains only comments and a single assignment: `VERSION = \"1.0.0b4.post1\"`.\n- All reports agree on benign nature, with confidence levels at 1.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or security concerns.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since the code is purely static and contains no executable logic beyond a variable assignment, the likelihood of malicious behavior is negligible.\n- No obfuscation or hidden code is present.\n- The license header is standard and does not introduce any security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The reasoning is sound, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code snippet is a benign, standard license and version declaration with no security concerns.",
