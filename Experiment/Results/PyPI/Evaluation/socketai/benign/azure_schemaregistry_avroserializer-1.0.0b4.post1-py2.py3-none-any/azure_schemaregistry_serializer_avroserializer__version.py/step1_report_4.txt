  "purpose": "This code appears to be a license header and version declaration for a software component, likely part of a larger codebase or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static license and copyright information, which are hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects; it only contains license text and a version string.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely static declarations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior; it is a standard license header and version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment block and a single version string assignment. No input handling, no execution logic, no external data reading or untrusted data processing. It is a typical boilerplate header, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard license header and version declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It poses no threat and is typical for open-source projects.",
