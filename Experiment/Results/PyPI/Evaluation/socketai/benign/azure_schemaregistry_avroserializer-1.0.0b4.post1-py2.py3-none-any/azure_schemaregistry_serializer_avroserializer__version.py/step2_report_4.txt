  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard license header and a simple assignment of a version string.\n- No reports identify any dynamic behavior, input handling, or code execution beyond static string assignment.\n- The code snippets are consistent with typical open-source license and version declaration patterns.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or signs of malicious intent are mentioned or evident.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis that the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign a security risk score of 0, consistent with the absence of any security vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is appropriate; the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Potential for Higher Risk Scores?**\n- Given the content, no basis exists for increasing any scores. The code is purely static, with no input, output, or executable logic that could be exploited.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n- No changes are necessary based on the provided code and reports.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is entirely benign, serving as a license header and version declaration with no security concerns.",
