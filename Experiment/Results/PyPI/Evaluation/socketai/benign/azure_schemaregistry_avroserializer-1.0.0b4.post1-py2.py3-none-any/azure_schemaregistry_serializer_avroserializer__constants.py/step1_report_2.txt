  "purpose": "Define constants for parsing an encoded payload consisting of a record format identifier, schema id, and encoded data.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data dynamically, it only defines constants.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no functions or data processing operations present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows are established as there are no executable statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and only defines constants. No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code segment only declares constants related to parsing a specific payload format. It does not include data input, processing, or external communication. No source-to-sink flows or malicious patterns are evident. It appears to be part of a larger codebase responsible for decoding or parsing encoded data, but on its own, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple declaration of constants used for parsing a structured payload. It poses no security risk, contains no malicious behavior, and does not exhibit obfuscation. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
