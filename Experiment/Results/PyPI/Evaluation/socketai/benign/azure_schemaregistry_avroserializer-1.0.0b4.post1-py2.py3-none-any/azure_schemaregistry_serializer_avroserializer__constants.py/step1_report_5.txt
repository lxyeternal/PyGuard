  "purpose": "Define constants related to parsing an encoded payload containing a record format identifier, schema ID, and data segment.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it only sets constants for parsing data segments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this snippet as it only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets integer constants indicating byte positions and lengths for parsing a specific data format. No dynamic execution, data processing, or input handling occurs. There is no indication of malicious intent, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard declaration of constants for data parsing. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and purpose-specific.",
