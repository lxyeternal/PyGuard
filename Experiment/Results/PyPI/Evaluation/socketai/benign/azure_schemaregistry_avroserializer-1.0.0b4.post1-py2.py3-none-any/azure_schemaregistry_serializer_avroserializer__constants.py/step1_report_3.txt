  "purpose": "Define constants for parsing an encoded payload that contains a record format identifier, schema ID, and encoded data.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or data access in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, external calls, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is depicted as the code only sets constants for data indexing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward, defining constants for byte ranges.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static constants indicating byte ranges for parsing a payload. It does not perform any input, output, or processing. There are no suspicious behaviors, code injections, or malicious logic. The code is purely informational, meant for data extraction from a byte array.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a simple, benign set of constant definitions for parsing a binary payload. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
