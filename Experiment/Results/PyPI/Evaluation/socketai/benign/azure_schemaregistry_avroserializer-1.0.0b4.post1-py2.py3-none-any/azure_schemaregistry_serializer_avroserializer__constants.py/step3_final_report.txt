{
  "purpose": "Defines constants for parsing a structured binary payload, specifying byte offsets and lengths for record format identifier, schema ID, and data segment.",
  "sources": "Constants defining byte ranges for payload parsing; no data input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output; purely static constants.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions with clear comments.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares constants for payload parsing with descriptive comments. It contains no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The constants specify byte ranges for different segments of a binary payload. The code is simple, clear, and free of obfuscation or secrets. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The comments and structure suggest it is part of a larger system for payload interpretation, but on its own, it poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration constants for payload parsing. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
