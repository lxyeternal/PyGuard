  "purpose": "Define constants for parsing an encoded payload with a specific binary format.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, storage, or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "Contains detailed comments about payload structure but no suspicious or malicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets constants indicating byte positions for segments of a payload, with comments explaining the format. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be part of a larger system responsible for parsing payloads, not malicious on its own.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is benign, serving as configuration for parsing a specific binary payload format. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
