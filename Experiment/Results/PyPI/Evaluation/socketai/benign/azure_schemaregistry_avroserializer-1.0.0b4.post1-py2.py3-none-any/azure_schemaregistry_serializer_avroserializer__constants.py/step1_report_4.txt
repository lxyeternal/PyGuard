  "flows": "None; no data flow logic is implemented in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward constant definitions with clear comments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides constants for interpreting segments of a binary payload, indicating structured data parsing. There are no functions, data processing, or external data sources, and no suspicious logic or obfuscated code. The comments clarify the purpose of each segment. It appears to be a standard, benign setup for later parsing operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless setup defining byte offsets for payload parsing. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. No vulnerabilities are identified in this snippet.",
