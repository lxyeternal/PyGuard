  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package compatibility",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls extend_path on __path__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' -> call to extend_path with __path__",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; just a standard package extension pattern, no anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical pattern used in namespace packages to extend the __path__ variable for module discovery. It imports 'pkgutil' and calls extend_path with __path__ and __name__, which is standard practice. No user input, no external data sources, and no suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, legitimate pattern for namespace package support. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
