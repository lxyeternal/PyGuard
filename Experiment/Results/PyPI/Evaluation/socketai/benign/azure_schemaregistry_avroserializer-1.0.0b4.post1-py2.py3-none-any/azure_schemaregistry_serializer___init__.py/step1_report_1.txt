{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ variable using pkgutil to support namespace packages or package discovery.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and the output of pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code assigns the result of extend_path to __path__, which is a standard operation for package namespace management.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a straightforward, standard operation with no unusual patterns or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends the '__path__' variable, which is a common pattern in Python namespace packages. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows to sensitive sinks, and no suspicious or malicious constructs. The license header is standard for open-source software. The code is minimal, clean, and functional for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for namespace package support with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
