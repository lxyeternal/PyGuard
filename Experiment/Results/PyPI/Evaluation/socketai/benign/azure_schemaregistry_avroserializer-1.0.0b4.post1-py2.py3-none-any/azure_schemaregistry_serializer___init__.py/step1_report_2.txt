  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for a package using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pkgutil' and extension of '__path__' using 'extend_path'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' leads to extension of '__path__' without data from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard practice for package extension, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses 'extend_path' to modify the '__path__' variable, which is typical in namespace package implementations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, adhering to common Python package patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package setup snippet, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
