{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ using pkgutil to facilitate namespace package functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and imports 'pkgutil' to extend it.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could leak data or execute code dynamically.",
  "flows": "The code modifies __path__ by calling extend_path, which is a safe operation, and does not involve untrusted input or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package support; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses extend_path to modify __path__, a common pattern for namespace packages. It does not read user input, handle environment variables, or perform any network operations. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. The license header is standard and does not influence security assessment. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for package namespace management.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign snippet used for namespace package support. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The code is safe.",
