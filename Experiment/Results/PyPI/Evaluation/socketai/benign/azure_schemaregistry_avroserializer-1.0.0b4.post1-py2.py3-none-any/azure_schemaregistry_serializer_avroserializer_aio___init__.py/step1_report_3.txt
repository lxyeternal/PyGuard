  "purpose": "Export a class named AvroSerializer from a local module for serialization purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '_schema_registry_avro_serializer_async' and the list defining '__all__'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads a class; '__all__' exposes the class for external use.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, then defines '__all__' to specify exported symbols. It appears to be part of a package's API setup. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. No sources of untrusted input or sinks where untrusted data could be exploited are present. The code is standard for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a larger package intended for serialization, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
