{
  "purpose": "Re-exports the AvroSerializer class from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from ._schema_registry_avro_serializer_async import AvroSerializer",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external output present",
  "flows": "None; the code only performs an import and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard licensing and import structure",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license header, an import statement, and a __all__ declaration. There are no data inputs, outputs, or execution flows that could introduce security risks. The import is a relative import of a module likely within the same package. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward re-export of a class from a local module, with no suspicious or malicious activity. It appears to be a benign part of a larger package, primarily serving as an interface for importing the AvroSerializer class.",
