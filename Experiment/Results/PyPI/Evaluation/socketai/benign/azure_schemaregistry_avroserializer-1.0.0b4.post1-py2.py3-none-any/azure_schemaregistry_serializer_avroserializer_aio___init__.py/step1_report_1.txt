{
  "purpose": "The code exports the AvroSerializer class from a local module for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AvroSerializer from a relative module, and the __all__ declaration listing 'AvroSerializer'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform any operations that handle untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows or data processing in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard module export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code structures. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a license header and a straightforward import and export statement. It does not include any data processing, external network connections, or dynamic code execution. The import is from a relative path, indicating local module usage. The __all__ list explicitly exposes 'AvroSerializer'. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The overall code is clean and standard for a Python module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module export snippet with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports a class from a local module for use elsewhere.",
