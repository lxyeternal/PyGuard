  "purpose": "Export the AvroSerializer class from a local module for schema registry AVRO serialization.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AvroSerializer from a relative module; no other data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points, no handling of untrusted data, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports a class from a relative path and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains only licensing information and a simple import/export statement, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export pattern with no malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and typical for Python packages.",
