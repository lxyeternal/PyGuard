  "purpose": "Re-export the AvroSerializer class from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '_schema_registry_avro_serializer_async'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines an export list.",
  "flows": "None; static import and export only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard module pattern, no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a license header, a static import of a class from a local module, and defines __all__ for export. It does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import is from a local module, and there are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, straightforward module export pattern with no security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module export with no malicious behavior or security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriate, and no further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
