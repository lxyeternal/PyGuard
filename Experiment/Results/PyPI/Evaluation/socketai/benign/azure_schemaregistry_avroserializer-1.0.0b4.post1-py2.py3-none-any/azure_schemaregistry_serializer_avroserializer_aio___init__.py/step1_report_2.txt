{
  "purpose": "This code exports the 'AvroSerializer' class from a local module, likely for use in serializing data in an asynchronous context, related to schema registry and Avro serialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '_schema_registry_avro_serializer_async' to import 'AvroSerializer'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or outputted in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the flow is simply importing a class and defining an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or unusual behaviors. It only performs an import and defines an __all__ list.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module export pattern in Python. It imports a class from a relative module and defines __all__ for exports. There are no user inputs, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module export with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger library related to Azure or schema registry serialization.",
