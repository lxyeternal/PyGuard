      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate dependency analysis utility with no malicious intent. Its main security consideration is the use of user-supplied URLs for network requests, which could be exploited if URLs are maliciously set, but this is standard and not indicative of malicious behavior. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with its functionality."
