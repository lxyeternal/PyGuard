  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for the Python package, including author, email, and version information.",
  "sources": "The code sources are the string assignments to __author__, __email__, and __version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code fragment; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, inputs, or outputs; the code only assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is simple metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata with author, email, and version details. No external input handling, no data processing, and no dynamic or malicious behavior are observed. The snippet appears to be part of a larger setup or module file but by itself does not pose any security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only static metadata declarations with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard and benign part of a Python package setup.",
