  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__).\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code is benign, standard for Python package metadata.\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are detected or implied.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature, which is justified.\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns & Assumptions**:\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on assumptions; the analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n   - Since no suspicious activity or malicious patterns are present, there's no reason to adjust the scores.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard metadata declaration snippet with no security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence should stay at 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is harmless, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's nature.",
