  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the code as simple metadata declarations, assigning static strings to `__author__`, `__email__`, and `__version__`. There are no input sources, no data flows, no external calls, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscation.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \n- No reports mention any suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or dynamic behaviors.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, benign, and typical for package metadata.\n\n3. **Error or Logical Flaws in Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is metadata-only and pose no security risks.\n- No logical errors or misjudgments are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n- The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**  \n- Since the code is static metadata, there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors to assume.\n- No claims of potential vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all assessments are consistent with the code's content.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation & Personal Assessment**  \nGiven the consistency across reports and the code's simplicity, I concur with the assessments. The code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. No changes are necessary. The code is a standard, safe metadata declaration with no security concerns.",
