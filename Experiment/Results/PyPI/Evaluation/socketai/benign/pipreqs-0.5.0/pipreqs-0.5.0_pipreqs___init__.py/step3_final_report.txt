  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for package author, email, and version information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string variables (__author__, __email__, __version__).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments without dynamic or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains only static variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for package metadata. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, dynamic behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify this as benign, metadata-only code with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static metadata declaration with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and their scoring is justified. No revisions are necessary.",
