  "purpose": "Dependency management, listing, uninstalling, dependency graph visualization, and package info display for Python packages.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments and prompts, package metadata from pkg_resources and pip internals.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call for 'pip uninstall' commands, printing to stdout/stderr, get_distribution calls.",
  "flows": "User input/flags trigger functions that invoke subprocess calls and package data retrieval, with no untrusted network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Monkey patching pip internal modules for compatibility; use of subprocess for uninstallation; no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency management tasks, including listing, visualization, and removal of packages. It interacts with pip internals and uses subprocess calls controlled by user prompts or flags. No signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft are present. The monkey patching of pip internals is a known workaround and not malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The subprocess calls are user-controlled, minimizing risk. The overall behavior aligns with legitimate package management utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, open-source dependency management tool for Python packages. It performs listing, visualization, and uninstallation functions without any malicious intent or behavior. The low security risk score reflects potential misuse if the script is misappropriated, but the code itself is benign.",
