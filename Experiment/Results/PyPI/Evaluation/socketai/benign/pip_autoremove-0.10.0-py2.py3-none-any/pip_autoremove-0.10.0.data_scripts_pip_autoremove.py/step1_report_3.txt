{
  "purpose": "This script manages Python package dependencies, allowing listing, removal, and dependency graph analysis of installed packages.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line options and prompts, system environment for subprocess calls, and package dependency data from installed distributions.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call for 'pip uninstall' which uninstalls packages, and printing to stderr for error messages.",
  "flows": "User options trigger dependency graph analysis and potentially uninstallation commands executed via subprocess, based on user confirmation or flags.",
  "anomalies": "Use of monkey patching to access internal pip modules; dynamic handling of pip's internal structure; reliance on user input for confirmation; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a dependency management tool that inspects installed packages, their dependencies, and can remove specified packages. It utilizes standard pip and pkg_resources modules. The code includes handling for different pip versions and user input for confirmations. It performs dependency graph analysis and package uninstallation through subprocess. No signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident. The use of internal pip modules and dynamic patching could be considered potentially risky, but these are not malicious by themselves. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a dependency management utility for Python packages with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. Its core operations are standard and focus on listing and removing dependencies. No security risks or malware signals are present based on the code review.",
