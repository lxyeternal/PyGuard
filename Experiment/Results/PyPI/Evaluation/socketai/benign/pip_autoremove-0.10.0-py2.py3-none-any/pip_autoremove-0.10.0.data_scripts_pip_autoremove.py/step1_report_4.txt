{
  "purpose": "The script manages Python package dependencies, allowing listing, uninstalling, and dependency graph visualization, mainly for maintenance or cleanup tasks.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, and potentially system environment when invoking pip commands.",
  "sinks": "Uninstallation commands executed via subprocess with package names, and possible data printed to stdout/stderr.",
  "flows": "Input args → command parsing → dependency graph analysis → subprocess call for uninstall with package names.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Uses standard package management functions. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with installed Python packages, their dependencies, and uninstallation routines. It uses pip internals and pkg_resources to gather package info, then conditionally uninstalls packages based on user input or command options. The subprocess call to pip for uninstallation is standard. No code injection, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code includes user confirmation prompts but does not automate malicious data collection or remote commands. Overall, the code appears to be a package maintenance utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a package dependency manager and cleaner. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware. It simply manages local package installations via pip commands and dependency graphs, with user confirmation when uninstalling packages. There are no suspicious code patterns or malicious signals identified.",
