  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'pretend' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads file content into 'readme' variable, then uses it in setup() without further data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading a README file and invoking setuptools' setup() with static parameters. No dynamic or untrusted data processing, no code injection, and no suspicious network or system operations. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package configuration. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
