{
  "purpose": "To configure and set up the 'pretend' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.rst' file for long description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leaks or harmful actions",
  "flows": "Reads README.rst -> uses data in setup() configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata such as version, name, description, author info, URL, license, and classifiers. All operations are standard for Python packaging and involve no external inputs or execution of untrusted code. No signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code. The data flow is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
