  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package named 'pretend', providing package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the file 'README.rst' to obtain the long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "The content of 'README.rst' flows into the 'long_description' parameter of setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard setup patterns. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup procedure using setuptools. It reads a README file for documentation and supplies package metadata such as version, author, email, license, and classifiers. The process appears typical for a Python package setup script. No external inputs are processed apart from reading a static file. No malicious behaviors or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
