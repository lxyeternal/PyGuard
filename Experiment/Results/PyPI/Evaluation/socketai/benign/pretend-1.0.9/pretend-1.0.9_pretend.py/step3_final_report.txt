  "purpose": "Utility classes and functions for mocking, dynamic method dispatch, exception raising, and call recording, primarily used in testing or metaprogramming contexts.",
  "sources": "Class instantiation (__new__, __init__), method calls, function arguments, internal class dictionaries (__dict__).",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures, class attributes, method dispatch via __dict__, no external or system data flows.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs, args) stored in instance attributes; dynamic method dispatch via __dict__[method]; exception raising in raiser; call recording in call_recorder decorator.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class creation and method dispatching, which are typical in testing frameworks but could be misused; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility classes for mocking (stub), exception raising (raiser), call recording (call), and dynamic class creation with cached subclasses. It relies on standard Python features like type(), __dict__, and decorators. No external data processing, network activity, or system modifications are present. The dynamic features are typical for testing utilities and do not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden payloads. The use of class caching and method dispatch is safe and common in such contexts. Overall, the code appears benign, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module used for mocking, exception handling, and call recording, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The dynamic features are standard in testing frameworks and do not pose a threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis.",
