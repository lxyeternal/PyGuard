{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility classes and functions for dynamic method dispatching, creating stub objects with configurable magic methods, raising exceptions, and recording function calls.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from class instantiation parameters (__new__ and __init__), method calls (via dynamic dispatch), and function arguments (call_recorder).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data leading to security effects are present. The code does not perform any I/O, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources (kwargs, function arguments) flow into object creation (__new__, __init__), dynamic method calls (via __dict__ lookups), and call recording (call_recorder). No external data or untrusted sources are used in a harmful manner.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically creates classes with magic methods and supports flexible method dispatch. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code does not execute untrusted input or perform unsafe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of magic methods for Python classes, with compatibility for Python 2 and 3. It dynamically constructs classes with specified magic methods using caching, allowing creation of stub objects that respond to these methods by dispatching to their stored functions. The raiser function checks if an exception is a valid exception type or instance and returns a function that raises it. The call class records arguments and supports equality, hashing, and representation. The call_recorder decorator records calls to a function by appending call objects to a list. Throughout, the code relies on standard Python features for dynamic class creation, method dispatch, exception handling, and call recording without any malicious or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility code intended for mocking, testing, or dynamic behavior simulation. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward and safe.",
