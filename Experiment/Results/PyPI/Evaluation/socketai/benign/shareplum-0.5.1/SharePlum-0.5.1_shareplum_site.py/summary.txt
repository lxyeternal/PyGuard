  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SharePoint client library with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The low security risk primarily relates to configuration options (e.g., SSL verification toggle, recover=True in XML parsing), which are standard considerations rather than active vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minor configuration concerns. The reports' assessments are consistent and justified."
