{
  "purpose": "This code manages SharePoint folders and files via REST API calls, including creating, deleting, uploading, and retrieving files.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'session' object, response JSON data, and function parameters such as folder_name, file_name, and content.",
  "sinks": "Uses post() and get() functions to send HTTP requests to specified URLs, potentially affecting remote SharePoint resources or retrieving data.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., folder_name, file_name, content) is used to build URLs and request bodies, which are sent via post/get functions to the SharePoint API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code. No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected, such as dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with SharePoint REST API endpoints for folder and file management. It constructs URLs and headers based on input parameters and session data. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are apparent; the functions perform standard API operations like create, delete, upload, and retrieve files. The contextinfo property fetches form digest values needed for authenticated requests, a typical SharePoint operation. The code appears well-structured for its purpose, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical SharePoint REST API interactions for folder and file management without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. No malicious behavior or malware indications are evident. It appears to be legitimate application code for managing SharePoint resources.",
