{
  "purpose": "This code manages SharePoint folder and file operations via REST API, including creating, deleting, uploading, and retrieving files and folders.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration via self.contextinfo (API call), input parameters such as folder_name, file_name, and content in methods.",
  "sinks": "API calls that perform delete, upload, checkout, check-in, or retrieve actions potentially affecting SharePoint data, and the use of response content.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., file_name, folder_name) influence API request URLs and headers; responses are returned as JSON or content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution observed. Use of API responses appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard REST API interactions with SharePoint for folder and file management, utilizing 'post' and 'get' functions, and dynamic URL composition based on input parameters. No evident malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code assumes trusted API endpoints and data inputs. There are no signs of data leakage, credential theft, or hidden malicious behaviors. Proper usage of API endpoints and headers aligns with expected SharePoint interactions. The code does not contain obfuscated segments or suspicious patterns beyond normal API usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate SharePoint management logic without malicious intent. It handles file and folder operations through API calls securely with proper request headers and URL constructions. No malware, data leakage, or sabotage detected.",
