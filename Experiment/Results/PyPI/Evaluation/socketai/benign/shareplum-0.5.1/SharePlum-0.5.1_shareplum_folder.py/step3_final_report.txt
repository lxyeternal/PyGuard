{
  "purpose": "A SharePoint REST API wrapper for folder and file management operations, including create, delete, upload, check-in/out, and retrieval functions.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as folder_name, file_name, comment, relative_url; API responses from get/post requests; dynamic headers including contextinfo['FormDigestValue'].",
  "sinks": "API calls to SharePoint endpoints with URL and header data; responses processed into JSON or content; potential for malformed requests if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are embedded into URL strings and headers; responses from get/post requests are parsed and used for subsequent requests or returned data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; reliance on external 'get' and 'post' functions; no error handling shown; direct string interpolation of user inputs into URLs without sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SharePoint API client performing typical folder and file operations. It constructs URLs dynamically based on input parameters and API responses, which is common for such wrappers. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The malware score is 0, as there are no signs of malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging potential issues if inputs are malicious. The code does not perform unsafe operations or contain secrets, but untrusted inputs could cause malformed requests. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with expected API interaction patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward SharePoint REST API client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
