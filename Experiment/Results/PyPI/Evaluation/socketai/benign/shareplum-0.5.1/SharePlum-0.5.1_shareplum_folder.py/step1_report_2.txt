{
  "purpose": "Provides an API wrapper for SharePoint folder and file management operations via REST API.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from internal attributes; uses imported 'get' and 'post' functions for network requests; reads response JSON data; accesses 'FormDigestValue' from contextinfo.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via 'get' and 'post' functions; uses response data and headers for API interactions; handles file contents and metadata.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., file content, folder names) flows into network requests; response data (e.g., JSON, file content) flows back from network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; use of dynamic API URLs appears standard. No unusual code patterns or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily acts as a client for SharePoint REST API, performing typical CRUD operations on folders and files. It uses session management and dynamic URL construction based on provided parameters. It reads data from the API responses and uses 'FormDigestValue' for authorization. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated logic are present. The use of network functions 'get' and 'post' appears to be standard, with no evidence of misuse or malicious intent. The code operates within expected API interaction patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a SharePoint API client for folder and file management with no detectable malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain suspicious code or behavior, and follows standard API interaction patterns. It appears safe and legitimate.",
