      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SharePoint API client with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are appropriate. The moderate risk score (0.2) reflects potential security concerns related to XML parsing and SSL verification practices but does not indicate malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SharePoint client library with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The low security risk primarily relates to configuration options (e.g., SSL verification toggle, recover=True in XML parsing), which are standard considerations rather than active vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minor configuration concerns. The reports' assessments are consistent and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SOAP XML builder with no malicious intent or activity. The primary security concern is the potential for XML injection or XXE vulnerabilities if inputs are untrusted and the XML is parsed insecurely downstream. The current scores are appropriate, but implementing input validation and using defusedxml for parsing would mitigate these risks. Overall, the code is benign, with moderate security considerations related to XML handling."

The low security risk score reflects inherent risks in credential transmission but is justified. The malware score remains at 0, indicating no malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
