  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or external data fetching. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. Confidence in benign nature is high (score 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious activity. All reports are accurate, and scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
