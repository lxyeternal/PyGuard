  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a SharePoint-related library or module.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading occurs in the code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. The first class ShareplumError allows optional inclusion of detailed error messages, concatenating message and details if provided. The second class ShareplumRequestError inherits from ShareplumError without additional modifications. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure is straightforward and typical for exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves to improve error handling clarity in a larger codebase. No malware or security risks are present.",
