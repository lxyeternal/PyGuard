{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in the Shareplum library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with optional 'details' parameter in the constructor.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network activity, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class inheritance with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception. The first class, ShareplumError, allows an optional 'details' argument to augment the message. The second class, ShareplumRequestError, inherits from ShareplumError without additional modifications. There are no data inputs, external interactions, or security-sensitive operations. The code is standard, benign, and purely structural for error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The analysis confirms the code's benign and structural purpose, and the scores are justified and accurate.",
