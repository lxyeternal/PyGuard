  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SharePoint-related errors",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read in this code",
  "sinks": "No sink points where data is output to external systems or files",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as the code only defines exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class. The ShareplumError class allows an optional 'details' parameter to augment error messages. The ShareplumRequestError class inherits from ShareplumError without modifications. There are no data input/output, no code execution, no obfuscated code, nor suspicious behaviors observed. The code's structure and content are straightforward and typical for custom exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely for defining custom exception classes with no malicious or security-risk behavior present.",
