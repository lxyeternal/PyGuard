  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The code snippets in all reports are identical to the original code provided.\n   - They define two custom exception classes: `ShareplumError` with an optional `details` parameter, and `ShareplumRequestError` inheriting from it.\n   - No data inputs, external interactions, or sensitive operations are present.\n   - The code is straightforward class inheritance, typical for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The code is simple, correct, and follows standard Python practices.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n3. **Score Review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1, which seems reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:\n   - The `malware` score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The `securityRisk` is 0, consistent with the code's harmless nature.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - Overall, the scores align well with the code's content.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions & Claims**:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and free of security risks.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n\n6. **Consistency & Final Estimation**:\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n   - The overall assessment is that this code is purely structural, serving as error handling classes with no security concerns.\n\n**My Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (very low, as it's just class definitions but considering the possibility of future misuse, still minimal)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as they are. No further action or concern is warranted.",
