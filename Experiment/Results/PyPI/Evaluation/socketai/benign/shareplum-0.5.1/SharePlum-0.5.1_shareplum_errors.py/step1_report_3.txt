  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SharePoint interactions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, user input, or data reading operations are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward class inheritance and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. The ShareplumError class allows an optional details argument to augment the message. ShareplumRequestError inherits directly without modifications. There are no external inputs, data processing, or suspicious constructs involved. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
