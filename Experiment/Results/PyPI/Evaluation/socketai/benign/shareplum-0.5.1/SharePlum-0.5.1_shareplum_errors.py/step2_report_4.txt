  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - The code in all reports matches the original: two straightforward exception classes, with no external input, data processing, or malicious constructs.  \n   - No discrepancies or issues are identified in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   - The reports are consistent, thorough, and accurate in describing the code as simple class definitions.  \n   - No logical errors, misconceptions, or misinterpretations are evident.  \n   - The reasoning that the code is benign and purely structural is sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (no obfuscation)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)  \n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - No justification is needed for higher scores since no security concerns are evident.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**  \n   - All reports correctly assign `malware`: 0, as there is no malicious activity or code.  \n   - The code does not perform any network operations, code injection, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities**  \n   - The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they accurately state that the code is purely for error handling with no security issues.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions, data processing, or suspicious patterns.  \n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, and the assigned scores reflect that. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
