  "review": "Let's proceed with a detailed review of each report, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code.**  \nThe code in all reports is identical and straightforward: defining two custom exception classes, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. The classes include an optional 'details' parameter in the constructor, which is used to augment the error message.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning.**  \n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no data input/output, network activity, or other suspicious behavior.  \n- They note the absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.  \n- The analysis aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue.**  \n- All reports assign:  \n  - confidence: 1  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0  \n- These seem appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any higher risk scores.**  \n- Since the code is only class definitions for error handling, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.  \n- No evidence of malicious intent, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware scores.**  \n- Malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.  \n- No malicious behavior or code injection is present.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities.**  \n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly state that the code is benign and typical for exception handling.\n\n**Step 7: Check consistency of scores with the report content.**  \n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is simple, defining custom exceptions without any malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- No obfuscation, secrets, or external interactions are present.  \n- The purpose is purely structural for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** Confirmed, no issues.  \n- **Malware risk:** None, score 0.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None, score 0.  \n- **Security risk:** None, score 0.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.** They are accurate and reasonable given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe scores assigned in all reports are appropriate. No adjustments needed. The code is benign, and the security posture is unaffected.",
