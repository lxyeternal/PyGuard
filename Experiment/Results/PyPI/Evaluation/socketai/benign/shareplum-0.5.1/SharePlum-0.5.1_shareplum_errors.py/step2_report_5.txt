  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The code in all reports matches the original code provided.\n   - No modifications, obfuscations, or suspicious alterations are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward exception definitions, with no data processing, network calls, or external inputs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The code is simple and correct for its purpose.\n   - No issues in the exception class implementations.\n\n3. **Score Evaluation & Justification**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n   - Given the nature of the code—simple class definitions with no external interactions—these scores are appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified based on the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious payloads.\n   - The code serves as structural error handling components within a larger system.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The assigned scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct, no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is purely structural, intended for error handling.\n- It is free of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative in their scoring.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided scores and conclusions.**",
