  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SharePoint operations.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources; the code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or input is being processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling; class definitions do not involve data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class. ShareplumError constructs an error message, optionally including details, while ShareplumRequestError inherits from ShareplumError without modifications. There are no data inputs, network interactions, or sensitive operations present. The code is straightforward class definitions intended for error handling. No malicious behavior, code injection, or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
