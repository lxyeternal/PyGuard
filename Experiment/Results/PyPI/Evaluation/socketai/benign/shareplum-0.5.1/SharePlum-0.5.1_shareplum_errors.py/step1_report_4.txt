  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SharePoint-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code defines classes with no data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception. The __init__ method in ShareplumError formats an error message with optional details. The second class is a straightforward subclass without additional logic. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to serve as error handling within a larger codebase, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
