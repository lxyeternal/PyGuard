  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only defines two custom exception classes (`ShareplumError` and `ShareplumRequestError`) with no external input, data processing, or suspicious behavior. There are no errors, flaws, or malicious elements in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly state that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks. No mistakes or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the lack of obfuscation.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign `0`, which is justified because the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign `0`, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n   These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely structural, defining exception classes with no external interactions or sensitive operations, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted. The current score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign class definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security concerns.**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of my assessment:\n\n- The code is straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
