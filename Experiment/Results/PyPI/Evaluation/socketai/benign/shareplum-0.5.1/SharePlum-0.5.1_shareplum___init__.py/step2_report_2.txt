  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module initializer for the SharePlum library.\n- No untrusted data sources, external network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code only imports internal modules and sets package metadata, which is typical for a Python package's __init__.py.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware scores:** uniformly 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** also 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk scores:** all 0, consistent with the absence of security issues.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, and their conclusions are justified based on the code provided.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriately set to 0 given the code's simplicity and benign purpose.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting high certainty.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is necessary.",
