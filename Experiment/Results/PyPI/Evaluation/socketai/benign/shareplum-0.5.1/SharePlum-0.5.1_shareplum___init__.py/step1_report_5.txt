{
  "purpose": "To provide a simplified interface for interacting with SharePoint servers using Python, by importing relevant modules and defining metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.office365, .site, .version), which are likely part of the package; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows or untrusted data paths within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward, with standard import statements and metadata definitions. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules related to Office365 and SharePoint, sets up __all__, and defines package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no code execution, input handling, or data transmission. It appears to be a benign module initializer or package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. It mainly defines imports and metadata for a SharePoint library. No suspicious or malicious code was detected.",
