{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the __init__.py for the SharePlum library, importing internal modules and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.office365, .site, .version) and metadata variable definitions (__version__, __title__, __author__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external data handling, or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports internal modules and sets metadata; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer that imports internal modules and sets metadata variables. It does not process untrusted input, perform network communication, or execute dynamic code. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's simplicity and standard structure support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initializer for the SharePlum library, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the analysis. The confidence level is high (1), and the overall security assessment is that the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
