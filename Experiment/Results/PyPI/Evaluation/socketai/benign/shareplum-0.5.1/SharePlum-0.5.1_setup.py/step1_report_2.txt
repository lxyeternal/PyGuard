  "purpose": "Setup script for the SharePlum Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'shareplum/version.py' for version, reading 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data outputs or external commands executed.",
  "flows": "Reading version file -> setting package parameters -> installing dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to extract version; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: importing modules, reading version info from a file, and calling setup() with package metadata. The version extraction uses a regex pattern, which is typical and safe here. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data sources aside from files. Dependencies are specified plainly. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a straightforward, legitimate setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
