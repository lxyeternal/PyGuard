{
  "purpose": "To define package setup information for the 'SharePlum' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'shareplum/version.py', reading README.rst for long description, and importing setup functions.",
  "sinks": "None that involve untrusted data processing or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading version file -> extracting version -> passing metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no obfuscated or malicious patterns; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version information from a version file using regex, imports setup functions from setuptools or distutils, and reads the README for description. All actions are typical for a Python package setup script. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets present. Usage of external dependencies is declared explicitly. No source-to-sink flow indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It safely prepares package metadata for distribution.",
