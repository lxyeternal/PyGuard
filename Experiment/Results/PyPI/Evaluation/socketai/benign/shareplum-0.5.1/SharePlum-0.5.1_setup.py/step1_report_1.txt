  "purpose": "Setup script for the SharePlum Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'shareplum/version.py' to extract version; reading 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reading version file -> setting version; reading README -> setting long_description.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; standard setup procedure with safe file reads.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: importing modules, reading version info via regex, and reading a README file. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, no external untrusted data sources beyond standard package metadata files. All data reads are from static files. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It reads version information and description metadata from static files, and configures package details for distribution.",
