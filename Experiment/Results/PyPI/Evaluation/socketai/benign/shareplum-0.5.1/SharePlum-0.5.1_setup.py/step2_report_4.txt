  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the code and reasoning.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a typical Python setup script.\n- It reads version info from a static file using regex.\n- It reads a README file for long description.\n- It sets package metadata and dependencies.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The try-except import pattern is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code correctness:**  \n  The code performs standard setup tasks. The regex for version extraction is common, though it could throw an error if the pattern doesn't match, but this is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n- **Malicious activity:**  \n  No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code. No external code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Security risks:**  \n  The script reads local files only, with no untrusted data sources or external commands.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 or very close to zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of individual reports:\n\n#### Reports 1-3:\n- They uniformly conclude the script is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n- Confidence is high (1), which is justified.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns noted.\n- Their reasoning is sound.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a minor securityRisk (0.1).  \n- This is acceptable given the regex pattern could theoretically cause an error if the version pattern is not found, but this is a common and accepted practice.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Fully aligns with others, considering the code safe and standard.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All evidence points to zero; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  No obfuscation present.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Zero or near-zero, consistent with the reports.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough analysis and the nature of the code, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0",
