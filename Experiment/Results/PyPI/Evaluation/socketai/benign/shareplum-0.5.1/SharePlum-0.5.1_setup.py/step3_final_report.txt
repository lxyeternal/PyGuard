  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'SharePlum' library, reading version info and description from static files, and configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'shareplum/version.py' via regex, reads 'README.rst' for long description, static imports, and package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data leaks or external commands.",
  "flows": "Reads version and description files, then passes static data to setup(); no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for version extraction could cause errors if pattern doesn't match, but this is a common pattern and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, straightforward setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The regex pattern is standard and unlikely to be exploited maliciously. No network activity or code injection is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Minor regex failure risk is acknowledged but does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minimal risk score reflects a minor concern about regex robustness but is not indicative of security issues.",
