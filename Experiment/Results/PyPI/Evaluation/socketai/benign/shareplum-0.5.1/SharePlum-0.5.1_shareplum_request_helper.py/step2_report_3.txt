  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code, considering potential security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward wrapper around the `requests` library's session object, providing `get` and `post` functions with error handling.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The functions simply pass parameters, perform requests, check for HTTP errors, and raise custom exceptions.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code itself. All reports correctly identify the code as standard utility functions with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- **Logical or reasoning flaws:** All reports are consistent in their assessment that the code is benign and straightforward.\n- **Potential oversight:** The reports mention the potential for untrusted URLs or data leakage, but since the functions merely pass parameters, the actual risk depends on how these functions are used elsewhere. However, within this code snippet, no issues are evident.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, as the code is clear and readable.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0 or near-zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Scores and Reasonableness:\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The highest confidence is 1, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, given the code's benign characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Potential for misuse:** While the code itself is safe, improper use (e.g., passing untrusted URLs) could pose security issues, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- **Malicious activity detection:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nThe reports' evaluations are accurate and align with the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, safe utility for HTTP requests with proper error handling, and there are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's straightforward nature.",
