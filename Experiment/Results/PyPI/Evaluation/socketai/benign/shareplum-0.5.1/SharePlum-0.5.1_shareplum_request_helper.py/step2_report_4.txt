  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple wrappers around the `requests` library for GET and POST requests.\n- They uniformly conclude there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, suspicious data flows, or obfuscated code.\n- Error handling is implemented via custom exceptions, which is standard practice.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & flows:** Response handling with `raise_for_status()` is standard; no issues.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as a simple utility with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, consistent analysis.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 3\n- Same pattern, consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** all zero for malware and securityRisk, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- Same as above, consistent.\n- **Scores:** all zero for malware and securityRisk, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a minor securityRisk score (0.1), but still no malware.\n- The mention of a securityRisk=0.1 might be overly cautious, given the code's simplicity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9 — acceptable, but perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which is correct given the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, except the last report's 0.1, which might be slightly conservative but not unreasonable.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The code is a straightforward utility with no malicious behavior or security issues.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n### Final judgment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or at most 0.1 for the last report, but even that is conservative)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and well-understood. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
