  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward wrappers around the `requests` library, with error handling via custom exceptions.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are noted.\n- The code's purpose is purely to facilitate HTTP GET and POST requests with proper error management.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are identified.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-issue review:\n\n#### Reports 1-4:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Consistent, indicating the code is a standard utility with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 or very close (some reports mention 0.1 or 0.0)\n- **Justification:** The code is simple, well-understood, and does not perform any suspicious operations. The minimal security risk scores seem appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) possibly due to conservative assumptions. Given the code's simplicity, this seems somewhat overcautious.\n- **Recommendation:** The risk score should likely be 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Most assign 0, with one at 0.1; given the code's simplicity, a score of 0 is justified across all.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard utility module for HTTP requests with proper error handling, and there's no indication of any security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI recommend setting all scores as follows:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis of the code's behavior.",
