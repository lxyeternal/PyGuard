  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to perform HTTP GET and POST requests with error handling using the requests library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'session', 'url', and '**kwargs' used in session.get() and session.post() calls.",
  "sinks": "Response objects returned from session.get() and session.post(), used downstream by calling code.",
  "flows": "Input data ('session', 'url', '**kwargs') flow into requests.get()/post() calls, and responses are returned or exceptions are raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or backdoors, standard use of requests library with proper error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple wrapper functions around requests.Session's get and post methods, adding error handling that raises custom exceptions. No untrusted data is processed beyond passing parameters to requests methods. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be standard utility functions for HTTP communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic HTTP request operations with appropriate error handling and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and typical for a utility module.",
