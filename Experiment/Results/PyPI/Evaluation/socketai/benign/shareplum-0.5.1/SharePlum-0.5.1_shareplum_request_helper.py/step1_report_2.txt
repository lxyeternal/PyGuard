  "purpose": "Helper functions to perform HTTP GET and POST requests with error handling, intended for use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'session' object and parameters 'url' and '**kwargs' provided to the functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions send HTTP requests via the session object, which could potentially lead to data leakage if untrusted URLs are used.",
  "flows": "Input 'session', 'url', and '**kwargs' -> request is sent via session.get/session.post -> response is checked for errors -> response returned or exception raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious constructs present. The code performs standard request handling with error propagation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic wrappers around the 'requests' library for GET and POST requests with error handling. It relies on an external 'session' object, which is typical for persistent HTTP sessions. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network behavior are evident. The functions properly raise custom exceptions on failure. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward, standard request wrappers with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple, standard HTTP request handler with proper error management. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. No security risks are identified.",
