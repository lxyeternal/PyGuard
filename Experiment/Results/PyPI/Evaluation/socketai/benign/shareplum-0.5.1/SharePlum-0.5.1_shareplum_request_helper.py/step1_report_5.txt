  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for performing HTTP GET and POST requests with error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'session', 'url', and optional keyword arguments (**kwargs) passed to 'session.get' and 'session.post'.",
  "sinks": "Response objects returned by 'session.get' and 'session.post'. No direct untrusted data sinks present within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data ('session', 'url', '**kwargs') flows into 'session.get' or 'session.post', with responses checked for errors, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears straightforward, utilizing standard requests library patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that wrap the requests library's get and post methods, adding exception handling to raise custom errors on request failures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, malicious code injection, or backdoors. The code is simple and uses standard patterns without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic HTTP request handling with error management and does not exhibit any malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility module.",
