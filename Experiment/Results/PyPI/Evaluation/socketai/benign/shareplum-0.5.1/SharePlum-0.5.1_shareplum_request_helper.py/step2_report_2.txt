  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and evaluate the accuracy of their assessments, scores, and any potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for HTTP GET and POST with error handling. No malicious activity or security issues detected.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies that the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is a simple wrapper around requests, with proper error handling, no suspicious data flows or code.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion and confidence are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request handling with no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is a standard wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing straightforward request wrappers with error handling.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is simple, standard, and safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard utility functions with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes no signs of malicious code or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no hidden malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with a note on the confidence being slightly below 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies no malicious activity, but assigns a securityRisk score of 0.1, which seems slightly inconsistent given the code's simplicity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — somewhat conservative but acceptable.\n- **Justification:** The code itself does not introduce security risks; the small securityRisk score might reflect a cautious stance, but given the code's simplicity, this could be lowered.\n- **Conclusion:** Overall, the assessment is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All are 0, except report 5, which is 0.1—still acceptable given the context.\n\n**Potential concerns:**  \nThe code relies on an external 'session' object, which could be configured maliciously outside this snippet. However, based solely on this code, there are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — standard request wrappers with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The code is a minimal utility, and the only potential risk could stem from how the 'session' object is configured or used elsewhere, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary. The code appears safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
