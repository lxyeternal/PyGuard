  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code in question is a straightforward utility wrapper around the `requests` library, providing `get` and `post` functions with error handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The functions rely on an external session object, which is standard practice.\n- The error handling raises custom exceptions, which is good practice.\n- No signs of malware, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for HTTP GET/POST with error handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Helper functions for HTTP requests, intended for larger app.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; no malicious intent or security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Helper functions for Shareplum library.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior; standard request wrappers.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for HTTP GET/POST.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Wrapper functions with error handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Issue:** The securityRisk score is 0.1, implying a slight concern. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns, this seems unwarranted.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score should be 0, consistent with other reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0, except report 5, which assigns 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, this should be 0.\n- **Confidence:** High (1) for all, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- The scores across all reports are generally consistent and reasonable.\n- The only adjustment needed is for report 5: reduce `securityRisk` from 0.1 to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security issues)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores should reflect that, with a zero risk score across the board.",
