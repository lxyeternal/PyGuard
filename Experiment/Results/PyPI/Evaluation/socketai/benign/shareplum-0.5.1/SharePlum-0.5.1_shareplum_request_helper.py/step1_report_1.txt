{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for making HTTP GET and POST requests with error handling.",
  "sources": "The 'session.get' and 'session.post' method calls, which read URL and request parameters.",
  "sinks": "Response handling with 'response.raise_for_status()' which could raise exceptions based on untrusted responses.",
  "flows": "Input URL and request parameters flow into 'session.get/post', responses are checked and returned if successful.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data handling, no obfuscated code or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for making HTTP requests using a provided session object. Each function attempts to perform the request, raises an exception if the request fails, and catches network-related exceptions to raise a custom error. No input sanitization, no untrusted data flow beyond standard request parameters, and no suspicious code segments are present. The code appears to be a simple wrapper around the 'requests' library for error handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for making HTTP requests with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. It appears safe and intended solely for network communication purposes.",
