  "purpose": "Helper functions to perform HTTP GET and POST requests with error handling for the Shareplum library.",
  "sources": "Inputs include 'session', 'url', and additional request parameters (**kwargs).",
  "sinks": "The 'response' object returned by session.get/session.post, which could be used elsewhere in the application.",
  "flows": "Input session and URL flow into the session.get/session.post methods, then into response.raise_for_status(), and finally return response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no obfuscated code, and no hidden backdoors detected. The code uses standard requests library patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for making HTTP GET and POST requests with error handling. They utilize a session object and propagate exceptions as custom ShareplumRequestError. There are no suspicious data flows, no malicious code, and no insecure patterns such as unsafe eval, code injection, or data exfiltration points. The code appears to be straightforward wrappers around the requests library with proper exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard HTTP request operations with proper error management. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It is a simple utility module with no malicious intent.",
