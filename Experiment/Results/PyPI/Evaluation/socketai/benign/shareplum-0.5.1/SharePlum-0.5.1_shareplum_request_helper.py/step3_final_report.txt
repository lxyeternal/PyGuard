  "purpose": "Utility functions for HTTP GET and POST requests with error handling, designed to simplify network interactions within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The session object used to perform requests, and the URL parameters passed to the functions.",
  "sinks": "Response objects returned after successful requests; potential data leaks could occur if URLs or data are untrusted, but within this code, no direct sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input URL and request parameters flow into session.get/session.post, which then return response objects; error handling may raise exceptions, but no malicious data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple wrappers around the requests library's session object, adding error handling via try-except blocks. It does not include any suspicious or malicious logic, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The functions are designed for standard HTTP interactions, with proper exception raising. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The error handling is conventional, and the code's structure is clear and readable. Given the simplicity and transparency, the code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for HTTP requests with robust error handling. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The security risk and malware scores should be 0, and confidence is high that the code is safe.",
