  "purpose": "Define constants and keys used for application configuration, session management, and authentication.",
  "sources": "None; the code only declares string constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, input/output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; constants are used as static values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The author information is provided but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of string constants used for application configuration, session keys, cookies, and API credentials. There are no input sources, no data processing, no untrusted data flows, and no external interactions. All variables are static strings, and there are no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation. The presence of author metadata is typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration/constants module. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
