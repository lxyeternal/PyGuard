  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward constants module.\n- No external input, dynamic code, or data processing is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are indicated.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns are observed.\n- The code appears benign and typical for configuration purposes.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**  \n   The code is a simple set of string constant definitions. There are no issues or vulnerabilities in the code itself. All reports agree on this.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this code is non-malicious, static, and benign.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which aligns with the code's nature. Given the analysis, these scores are reasonable and should remain as is.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since no suspicious activity, secrets, or malicious intent are detected, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions. No backdoors, exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. Malware score should stay at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The assigned scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code fragment is a standard constants module with no security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.",
