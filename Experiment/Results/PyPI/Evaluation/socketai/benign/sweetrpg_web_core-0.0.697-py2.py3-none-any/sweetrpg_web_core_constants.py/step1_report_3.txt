  "purpose": "Define constants and keys for application configuration and session management.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code only defines static string constants.",
  "sinks": "No data is written or transmitted; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code only sets static variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of string constants used for configuration, API keys, cookies, and session data. It does not perform any input/output, network communication, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets appear to be present, and there are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The variables are named clearly and do not suggest malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration/constants module with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks identified.",
