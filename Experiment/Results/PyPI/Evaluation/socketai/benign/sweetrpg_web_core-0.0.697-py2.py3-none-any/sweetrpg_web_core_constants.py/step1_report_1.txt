  "purpose": "Define string constants for application configuration, session management, and security keys.",
  "sources": "None; all data are hardcoded string values assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input handling or data processing functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only initializes constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements detected. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code sets several string constants related to application paths, API keys, cookies, and session keys. All variables are statically assigned string literals, with no external input, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials for secrets, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code functions purely as a configuration module, typical in web applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a constants definition module. There are no indicators of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks in this fragment.",
