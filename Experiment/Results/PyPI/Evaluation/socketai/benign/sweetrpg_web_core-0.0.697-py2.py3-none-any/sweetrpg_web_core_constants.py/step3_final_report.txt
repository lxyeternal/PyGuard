  "purpose": "Defines application configuration constants, session keys, and security-related identifiers for a Python project.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments for paths, API keys, cookies, session identifiers, and author metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares constants without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants used for configuration and session management. There are no dynamic elements, input handling, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; the variables are generic key names. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate it is benign. All reports correctly identify this as a non-malicious, configuration-only module with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration constants module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
