  "purpose": "Define constants and keys used for application configuration, session management, and authentication.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for paths, API keys, cookies, session keys.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data input or output handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The author string is standard metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of string constants related to application configuration, session management, and security keys. It does not include any data input/output handling, external calls, or dynamic code execution. The hardcoded values are typical for configuration files. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple constants module used for configuration purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and poses no security risks. Its primary function is to provide named constants for use elsewhere in the application.",
