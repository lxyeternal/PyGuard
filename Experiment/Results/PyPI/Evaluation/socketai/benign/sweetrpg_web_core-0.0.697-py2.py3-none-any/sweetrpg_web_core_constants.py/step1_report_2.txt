  "purpose": "Define constants and keys for application configuration and session management.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only static assignment of string constants.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; constants are used for configuration keys.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; all values are static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and only defines string constants. No hardcoded credentials or secrets evident.",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares string constants for application paths, API keys, cookies, and session keys. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. The keys used seem standard for session and application configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration/constants module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger application setup. The code is clean and straightforward.",
