  "purpose": "Commented placeholder indicating health endpoints, likely part of a web service or API.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are read in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input, or output are present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code content; no suspicious or unusual code behavior. The only notable aspect is the author metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a UTF-8 encoding declaration, an author metadata string, and a docstring describing 'Health endpoints.' There are no executable statements, data handling, or logic. The author info is static and typical. No external libraries or inputs are used. Given the absence of code execution or data processing, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign code snippet serving as a placeholder or metadata annotation. No malicious activity, security issues, or obfuscation are present.",
