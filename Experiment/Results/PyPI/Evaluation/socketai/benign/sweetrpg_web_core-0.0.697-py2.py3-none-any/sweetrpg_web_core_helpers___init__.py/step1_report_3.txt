  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code content; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a UTF-8 encoding declaration, author metadata, and a brief docstring describing 'Health endpoints.' There are no functions, class definitions, input/output operations, or external data handling present. The content appears to be boilerplate or initial comments for a larger module or file. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder or descriptive header for health endpoint functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation.",
