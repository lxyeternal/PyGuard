  "purpose": "The code appears to define health endpoints, likely for monitoring or status checking in a web application.",
  "sources": "There are no explicit data input sources in this snippet; it only includes metadata and a comment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or operations that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as there are no executable statements or data processing occurring.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only metadata: author information and a comment, with no functional code, input handling, or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is minimal, consisting solely of a character encoding declaration, an author metadata string, and a comment. There are no functions, classes, data handling, or external calls. It appears to be a fragment or the beginning of a larger source file, but as provided, it does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, containing only metadata and a comment. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. It is likely part of a larger codebase, but on its own, it is safe.",
