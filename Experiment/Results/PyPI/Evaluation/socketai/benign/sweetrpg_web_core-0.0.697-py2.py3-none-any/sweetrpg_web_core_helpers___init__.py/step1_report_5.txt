{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define health endpoints, likely for a web service or API, based on the comment and author metadata.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__) and comment strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing are visible in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only metadata and comments, with no functional logic, input handling, or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a string encoding declaration, an author metadata variable, and a comment describing 'Health endpoints.' There are no functions, classes, data inputs, outputs, or other executable code. This indicates it is either part of a larger module or simply a placeholder. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The absence of any input handling or data processing means there are no typical attack vectors present.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a metadata or documentation part of a larger project without any executable logic.",
