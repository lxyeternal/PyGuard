  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'SweetRPG Web Core' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and some unicode symbols.",
  "sources": "Module-level string assignments for metadata; no data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no processing or handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No code execution, network activity, or data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variable assignments, which are static and predefined. No input reading, data processing, or external calls are present. No potential for data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity is evident. The unicode characters are harmless and serve decorative purposes. The code does not contain any logic, conditional statements, or dynamic behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely metadata definition without any malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard module header with no security concerns.",
