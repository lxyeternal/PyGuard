  "sources": "No input data sources; purely static metadata assignments",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignments only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of module-level metadata definitions with no executable logic",
  "analysis": "The code contains only module-level string and metadata variable assignments with no executable statements, input/output operations, or dynamic code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The content is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or metadata file, and no suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign metadata file providing package information. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
