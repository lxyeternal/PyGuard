  "purpose": "Static package metadata variables defining application information, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative emojis.",
  "sources": "Module-level variable assignments (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__)",
  "sinks": "None; no input/output, data processing, or external data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment of variables without data flow or untrusted data sources",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Unicode emojis in __cake__ variable, which are purely decorative; no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments used for package metadata, with Unicode emojis used decoratively. No functions, input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior are present. The code is straightforward, typical for a Python package's __init__.py or setup.py. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are identified. The Unicode emojis are harmless and serve aesthetic purposes. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
