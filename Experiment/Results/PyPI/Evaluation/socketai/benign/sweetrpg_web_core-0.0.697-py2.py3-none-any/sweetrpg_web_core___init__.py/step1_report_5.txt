  "purpose": "Define metadata and basic information for the 'SweetRPG Web Core' Python package, including title, description, version, author, and license.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; metadata variables are statically assigned strings and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow targets are present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as the code only sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains an empty docstring and decorative Unicode characters in a variable (__cake__), which are harmless but somewhat unusual. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of metadata variables with static string values. No input handling, data processing, or external communications are present. The presence of Unicode characters in a variable is benign. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code appears to be a typical module-level metadata declaration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign metadata definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. It simply provides package information for distribution.",
