  "sources": "Function parameters: response_class, code, message, attribute",
  "sinks": "Raising an exception of type response_class with a response dictionary",
  "flows": "Parameters are used to construct response; response_class is instantiated with response and raised",
  "anomalies": "External response_class parameter could be malicious if misused; no obfuscation or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a response dictionary from input parameters and raises an exception of the provided response_class. It does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. The main concern is that response_class is supplied externally, which could be malicious if crafted maliciously, potentially leading to code execution. However, within this snippet, there is no malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is a standard pattern in web frameworks, with minimal inherent risk. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code is present. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the potential misuse of response_class if malicious, but this is outside the code's scope. Confidence in these conclusions is high (around 0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe utility for raising HTTP exceptions with custom responses. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The primary concern is the external response_class parameter, which could be misused if maliciously crafted, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
