  "purpose": "To generate and raise web exception responses with specified code, message, and optional attribute.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters: code (str), message (str), attribute (str)",
  "sinks": "The raised response_class instance which receives the response dictionary",
  "flows": "Parameters are used to construct a response dictionary, which is then passed to the response_class constructor in a raise statement",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious behavior detected. The function simply constructs and raises an exception object.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard exception class from werkzeug, defines a function that creates a response dictionary with provided data, and raises an exception instance of response_class with that response. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic. The parameters are used straightforwardly, and no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks outside the standard exception raising. The structure appears standard for web error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a utility to raise web exceptions with specified details. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
