  "purpose": "To generate and raise an HTTP error response with a specified code, message, and optional attribute.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the function 'error_response' (response_class, code, message, attribute).",
  "sinks": "The raise statement that raises an exception of type response_class with a constructed response dictionary.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to build a response dictionary, which is then passed to instantiate and raise response_class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only handles data formatting and exception raising.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to generate an error response and raises an exception of a provided class type. It uses provided arguments to build a response dictionary. The response class is expected to handle this response dictionary. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, no data leaks, or suspicious logic are present. The function is a typical error handling utility, and there are no signs of malicious intent or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for raising structured HTTP exceptions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for error reporting within a web application.",
