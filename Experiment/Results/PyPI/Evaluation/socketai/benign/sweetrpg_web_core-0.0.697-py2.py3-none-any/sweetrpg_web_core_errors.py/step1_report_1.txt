  "purpose": "To generate and raise HTTP error responses with specific codes, messages, and optional attributes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading mechanisms are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Raising an exception of type response_class with a response dictionary as payload.",
  "flows": "No external input flows into the code; the function parameters are assumed to be controlled by the caller.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code constructs. The code raises an exception with a dictionary payload, which could be risky if response_class does not handle this properly, but this is typical in web frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that constructs a response dictionary with provided code, message, and optional attribute, then raises an exception instance of response_class initialized with this response. There are no sources of untrusted data within this code itself; it relies on external parameters. The exception raised is a standard pattern for web error handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for error handling in a web application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility function for generating and raising HTTP exceptions in a web framework. It does not contain malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It should be safe for use provided that response_class is used properly.",
