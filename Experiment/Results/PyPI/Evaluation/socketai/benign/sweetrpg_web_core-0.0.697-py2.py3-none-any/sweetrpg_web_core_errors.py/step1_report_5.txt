{
  "purpose": "To generate and raise an HTTP error response with specific details such as code, message, and attribute.",
  "sources": "The input parameters 'code', 'message', and 'attribute', which are used to populate the response dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The 'raise response_class(response=response)' line, which raises an exception instance created with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct a response dictionary, which is then passed to instantiate and raise an exception of type response_class.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. The function simply constructs and raises an exception with provided data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to generate and raise an HTTP exception with a custom response payload. The parameters are used to create a response dictionary. There are no external data sources, environment variable usages, or suspicious operations. The response data is directly used to instantiate an exception class, which is standard behavior for error handling in web frameworks. The function's design appears straightforward and safe. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for raising HTTP exceptions with custom responses. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities. It simply constructs and raises an exception based on provided parameters.",
