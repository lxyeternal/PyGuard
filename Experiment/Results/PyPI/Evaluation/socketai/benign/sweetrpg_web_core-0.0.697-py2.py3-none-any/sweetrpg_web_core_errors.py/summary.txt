  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe utility for raising HTTP exceptions with custom responses. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The primary concern is the external response_class parameter, which could be misused if maliciously crafted, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
