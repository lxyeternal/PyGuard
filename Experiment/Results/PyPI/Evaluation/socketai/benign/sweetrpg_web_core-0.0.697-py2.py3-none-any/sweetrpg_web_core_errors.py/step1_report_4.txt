{
  "purpose": "Define a function to generate and raise a web error response with specified details.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user input; response data is constructed from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The response_class constructor or raise statement, which could potentially execute untrusted code if response_class is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (code, message, attribute) flow into the response dictionary, which is then passed as an argument to response_class, then raised as an exception.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The only potential concern is the use of response_class in a dynamic context, which could be misused if response_class is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function to create a dictionary with error details and raises an exception of response_class with that dictionary. The function does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or handle external inputs directly, aside from parameters. The raise statement relies on response_class, which must be an exception class compatible with the response parameter. Since response_class is provided externally, if it is malicious or crafted maliciously, it could lead to code execution when instantiated or raised. However, within this code, there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code, just a typical pattern for error handling in web applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error response generator with no inherent malicious behavior. The only potential risk depends on how response_class is used or supplied. No malware or security risks are evident within this code fragment itself.",
