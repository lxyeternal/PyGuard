{
  "purpose": "Provides health check endpoints (/status and /ping) for a Flask application, including build info and registered service hooks.",
  "sources": "Reads build info JSON file specified by environment variable; invokes registered hooks.",
  "sinks": "File I/O for build info; hook invocation results stored in response.",
  "flows": "Environment variable -> file read -> JSON load; hooks -> result aggregation.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling without logging; reliance on external environment variables and hooks without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard health checks with external configuration and hook invocation. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Broad exception handling could hide errors but is not malicious. External data sources and hooks could be manipulated, but the code itself does not execute malicious actions. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or code injection are detected. The use of environment variables and hooks introduces minimal risk, which is reflected in the low risk score. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign health check implementation with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score around 0.2–0.3 accurately reflects minimal external manipulation potential. No adjustments are necessary.",
