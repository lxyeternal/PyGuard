  "purpose": "Provides health check endpoints for a Flask web application, including service status and build info.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'constants.BUILD_INFO_PATH', opens and reads JSON file at that path, calls registered service hooks.",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variables, file I/O, JSON loading, calling external service hooks.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'BUILD_INFO_PATH' -> open file at path -> load JSON content -> include in response; Service hook functions -> their results -> include in response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. The use of try-except in service hooks is broad, but not suspicious itself.",
  "analysis": "The code provides health endpoints with minimal processing. It reads a build info file based on an environment variable, which could be manipulated if the environment variable is set maliciously. The registered service hooks are called, and their results are included in the response, which could potentially include untrusted or malicious data if the hooks are compromised. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. The overall code appears to be a standard health check implementation with safe patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard health check implementation with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The main potential concern is reliance on environment variables and external hooks, but these are expected behaviors and do not indicate malicious activity.",
