{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal metadata header or placeholder, containing only encoding declaration, author metadata, and an empty docstring.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, data sources, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code contains no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only metadata with no suspicious or unusual constructs, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata with no executable statements, data sources, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward, non-malicious nature of the snippet. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, metadata-only fragment with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
