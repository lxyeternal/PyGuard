  "purpose": "Client for managing DuckDNS TXT records, including setting, clearing, and validating domains.",
  "sources": "Domain input, token input, network request parameters, response text.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to DuckDNS API, response handling, exception raising.",
  "flows": "Input domain and token -> validation -> request parameters -> API call -> response check -> exception or success.",
  "anomalies": "Regex permits escaped backslashes in domain validation, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of domains using regex, constructs GET requests with parameters, and handles responses appropriately. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The token validation is basic but sufficient. The regex allowing escaped backslashes is a minor quirk but does not introduce security issues. Network requests are standard API calls with proper response checks. Exception handling is appropriate. Overall, the code is straightforward, purpose-driven, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific client for DuckDNS TXT record management with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The security risk score is minimal, around 0.1, considering the network interactions and validation. No adjustments needed; the code is safe for use.",
