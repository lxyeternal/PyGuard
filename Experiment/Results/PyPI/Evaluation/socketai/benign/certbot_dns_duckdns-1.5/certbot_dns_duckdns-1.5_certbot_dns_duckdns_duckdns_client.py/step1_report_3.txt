  "purpose": "Provides a client for managing DuckDNS TXT records, including validation, setting, and clearing records.",
  "sources": "User-provided domain names, API token, request responses from DuckDNS server",
  "sinks": "Requests to DuckDNS server with domain, TXT record, and token; exception messages",
  "flows": "Input validation for domain and token → API request with parameters → Response handling for success or failure",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, no unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code validates domains with regex, manages TXT records via HTTP GET requests, and raises exceptions on failure. Token validation is minimal, only checking for non-empty. The domain validation ensures only legitimate duckdns subdomains are processed. Requests are made directly with user-supplied data but are limited to API calls for DNS updates. No indication of data leakage, system compromise, or malicious intent. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity are evident. The code's structure is straightforward and adheres to expected API usage patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate DNS management functions without signs of malicious behavior. No malware or security risks are detected beyond standard validation. It appears to be a standard client library for DuckDNS operations.",
