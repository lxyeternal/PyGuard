{
  "purpose": "This module provides a client for managing DNS TXT records on DuckDNS, including setting and clearing records via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'token' during initialization, domain names via input parameters, and request responses from the DuckDNS update URL.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP GET requests to the DuckDNS API endpoint with parameters including token, domain, and TXT value; response status and text are used to determine success.",
  "flows": "Input token and domain -> Validation of domain -> Construction of request parameters -> HTTP request to DuckDNS -> Response check -> Raising exceptions if failed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of requests.get with parameters appears standard. No suspicious or hidden code behavior detected. The regex for domain validation is straightforward. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation of input domain against regex patterns, constructs HTTP GET requests with provided parameters, and processes responses. Exception handling is used for error conditions. The token is stored securely in the instance and not exposed externally. The URL and parameters used are standard for DuckDNS API interaction. No signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or backdoors. The code does not leak data or perform suspicious network activity beyond legitimate API calls. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate client implementation for managing DuckDNS TXT records with proper validation and error handling. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It adheres to expected patterns for such a utility.",
