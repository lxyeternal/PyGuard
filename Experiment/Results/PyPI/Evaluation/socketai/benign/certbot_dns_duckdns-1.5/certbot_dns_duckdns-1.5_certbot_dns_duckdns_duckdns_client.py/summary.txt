  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific client for DuckDNS TXT record management with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The security risk score is minimal, around 0.1, considering the network interactions and validation. No adjustments needed; the code is safe for use."
