  "purpose": "Unit tests for the DuckDNSClient class and associated domain validation functions.",
  "sources": "Constants TEST_DOMAIN and TEST_DUCKDNS_TOKEN; imported modules; method calls within test cases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows observed; the code primarily performs validation and testing.",
  "flows": "Test inputs are used to validate functions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs detected. No hardcoded credentials beyond a placeholder token, which is typical for tests.",
  "analysis": "The code implements unit tests for domain validation functions related to DuckDNS domains. It validates domain patterns, including special cases and invalid inputs, using assertions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code strictly performs validation and testing procedures without network operations, file I/O, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets or potential backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests verifying domain validation logic for a DuckDNS client. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code. It appears safe and legitimate for its purpose.",
