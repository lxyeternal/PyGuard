  "purpose": "Unit tests for DuckDNS client domain validation functions and internal methods.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded test data, import statements, and test method calls.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; primarily test assertions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation functions; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials aside from test tokens, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unittests for domain validation functions in the DuckDNS client. It tests domain format validation logic, including various subdomain and full domain cases, using hardcoded test data. The tests validate expected behavior without performing network operations, file manipulations, or executing untrusted inputs. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code structure is standard for unit tests, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite validating domain name logic, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to ensure correct validation behavior and contains no malicious or suspicious code.",
