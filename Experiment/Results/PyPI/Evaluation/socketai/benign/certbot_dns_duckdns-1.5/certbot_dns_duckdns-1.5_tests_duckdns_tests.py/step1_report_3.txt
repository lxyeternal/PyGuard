  "purpose": "Unit tests for the DuckDNS client validation functions and domain validation utilities",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for TEST_DOMAIN and TEST_DUCKDNS_TOKEN; imported functions from the client module",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; tests are only validating function outputs",
  "flows": "N/A; tests call validation functions with controlled inputs and verify expected outputs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code present; no hardcoded secrets beyond a non-sensitive token string used solely for testing purposes",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests verifying domain validation logic for DuckDNS domains, including edge cases and special characters. No data input from external sources is processed, and no network or system interactions are present. The test cases use static, hardcoded data. The import statements and test logic do not include any dynamic or potentially malicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or harmful functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests for validating domain formats and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It merely verifies the correctness of the domain validation functions and uses only static, controlled data. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is detected.",
