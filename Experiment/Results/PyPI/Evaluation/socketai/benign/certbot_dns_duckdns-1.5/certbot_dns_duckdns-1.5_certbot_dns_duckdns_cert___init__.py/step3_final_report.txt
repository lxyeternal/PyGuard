  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs such as user input, environment variables, files, network calls, eval/exec functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, subprocess executions, environment variable access, eval/exec usage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or environment variables to sinks such as network or file operations, possibly via dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code in reports 1 and 2; no obfuscation, no suspicious functions, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual control flow or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "Reports 1 and 2 correctly note the absence of code, assigning low confidence and zero malware/security risk scores. Reports 3, 4, and 5 describe benign scripts with typical data processing patterns, no malicious functions, and no obfuscation. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the descriptions. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), justified by potential for dynamic behavior or network activity not evidenced here. Confidence levels (0.75-0.8) reflect reasonable certainty based on the provided summaries. Overall, the assessments are accurate and appropriately cautious, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with their descriptions; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. Scores are appropriate given the information. The dependency appears benign, with minimal security risks. No adjustments necessary.",
