      "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor filename typo should be corrected for clarity but does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0, possibly slightly higher (e.g., 0.1) if emphasizing the typo as a minor oversight."

The overall security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is low to moderate. The scores assigned are consistent with the observed signals, with the highest concern in Report 1. No critical issues are confirmed, but caution is advised."
