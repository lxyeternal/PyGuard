  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'certbot_dns_duckdns' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading '__version__' from 'certbot_dns_duckdns' module; reading 'Readme.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; configuration-only script.",
  "flows": "Import of '__version__' and reading 'Readme.md' -> passing data to setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Filename 'Readme.md' likely a typo; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic execution, network activity, or malicious patterns. The only minor anomaly is the filename 'Readme.md' instead of 'README.md', which does not introduce security risks but may affect documentation rendering. All dependencies are version-constrained and standard. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments are present. The import of '__version__' assumes the attribute exists, which is typical. Overall, the script is benign and intended for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor filename typo should be corrected for clarity but does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0, possibly slightly higher (e.g., 0.1) if emphasizing the typo as a minor oversight.",
