{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the 'certbot_dns_duckdns' package, configuring its metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from 'certbot_dns_duckdns.__version__' and reads the long description from 'Readme.md'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the script mainly defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; version info and description are read from static files and module attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments are present. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version info from a module, reads a Markdown file for description, and configures package details for distribution using setuptools. It specifies dependencies, classifiers, and entry points, all of which appear standard for a Python package. No code injection, malicious network activity, or backdoors are detected. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, fulfilling typical package configuration purposes without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
