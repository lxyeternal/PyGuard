  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package that provides a Certbot plugin for DNS verification using DuckDNS domains.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from the 'certbot_dns_duckdns' module, reads the content of 'Readme.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the setup configuration is standard for packaging and does not execute untrusted code or handle external inputs at runtime.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README file content, then uses this data to configure the package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The filename 'Readme.md' appears to be a typo; it likely should be 'README.md', but this is a harmless typo, not an anomaly indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports package version info and reads a markdown file for description, then calls 'setup' to package the code. No user input, network activity, or execution of untrusted data occurs here. The only potentially suspicious point is the filename typo, which does not pose security risks but suggests a small oversight.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain malware or security risks. The only notable issue is the typo in the filename, which is harmless but could cause the README not to load properly.",
