  "flows": "None; no data flow or execution beyond variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; code contains only descriptive comment and version string, no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal, consisting solely of a descriptive comment and a version string declaration. There are no functions, data handling, network calls, or executable logic present. The absence of any operational code, data flows, or external interactions indicates no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, security risk score is 0, and obfuscated score is 0, with high confidence in benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple header comment and version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the minimal, benign nature of the snippet.",
