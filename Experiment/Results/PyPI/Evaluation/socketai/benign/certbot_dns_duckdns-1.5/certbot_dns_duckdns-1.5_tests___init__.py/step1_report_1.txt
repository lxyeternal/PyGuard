{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a basic mathematical calculation and print the result. It seems intended for simple computational purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user via the input() function, and also uses data from the math module.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to the console with print(). No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects are apparent.",
  "flows": "User inputs are assigned to variables, then used in calculations, and the result is printed. There are no untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are observed. The code is straightforward and lacks suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script collects two inputs from the user, converts them to integers, adds them together, and prints the sum. Usage of the math module is unnecessary but not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no unsafe operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, benign, and performs basic arithmetic with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware characteristics.",
