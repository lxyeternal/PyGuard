  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks. Report 2's dynamic execution features suggest a moderate threat level, warranting an increased malware score. Overall, the supply chain security posture is low risk, with minor concerns primarily in Report 2. Scores should be adjusted accordingly to reflect these insights."
