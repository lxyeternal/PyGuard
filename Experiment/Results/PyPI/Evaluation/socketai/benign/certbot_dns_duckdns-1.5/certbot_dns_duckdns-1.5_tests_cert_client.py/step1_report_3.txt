  "purpose": "Unit tests for the certbot_dns_duckdns plugin, testing authentication, error handling, and cleanup functions.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for API tokens, domain names, validation values, and URLs used in responses.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests made via responses library, primarily to DuckDNS update URL with token and domain parameters.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded API tokens and domain info used in URL; no untrusted input flows into system calls or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets other than tokens used in test setup; no suspicious or malicious code or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of unit tests that mock network responses for the DuckDNS plugin. It uses hardcoded tokens and domains within tests, which is typical for test code and not indicative of malicious intent. Network calls are made to specific URLs, but these are controlled and responses are mocked for testing. No data leakage, secret theft, or malicious behavior is detected. The code does not perform any unintended system modifications, data exfiltration, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of unit tests for the DuckDNS Certbot plugin, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It uses hardcoded test data and mocks network interactions appropriately. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities found.",
