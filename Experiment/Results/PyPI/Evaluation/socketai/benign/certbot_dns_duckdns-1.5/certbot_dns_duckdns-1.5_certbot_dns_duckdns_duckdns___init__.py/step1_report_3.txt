  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script that performs data processing, possibly for a larger application or service.",
  "sources": "Input data from user inputs, environment variables, or external files (exact sources not specified in the provided code).",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to files, network connections, or logs; specific sinks are not detailed in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input) through processing functions and potentially to sinks (output or storage). No explicit malicious flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving standard data processing steps. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication with suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. Usage of third-party libraries is typical. No unsafe SQL or insecure environment variable handling apparent. The code structure is clear, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard for its apparent purpose.",
