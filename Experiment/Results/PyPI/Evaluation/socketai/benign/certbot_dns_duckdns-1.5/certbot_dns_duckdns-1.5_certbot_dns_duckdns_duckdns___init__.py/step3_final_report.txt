  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data exfiltration pathways, dynamic code execution points, network communication functions, input reading functions.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variable access, eval/exec calls, data leaks to external servers.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input functions or data reads flow into processing functions, which may then lead to sinks like network transmission or file modification.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, use of dynamic code execution (eval/exec), suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, unusual control flow or variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating potential malicious intent. Suspicious patterns include complex or encrypted segments, use of eval/exec with untrusted data, and network communication without clear purpose. Benign code lacks obfuscation, straightforward logic, and does not perform suspicious operations. The presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution increases the likelihood of malicious behavior, but without concrete payloads or exfiltration, the threat remains moderate. The code's structure and signals justify a cautious assessment, with particular attention to obfuscation and potential data leakage pathways.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks definitive malicious payloads. The overall security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is low to moderate. The scores assigned are consistent with the observed signals, with the highest concern in Report 1. No critical issues are confirmed, but caution is advised.",
