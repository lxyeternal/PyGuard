{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package called 'types-beautifulsoup4' by providing metadata and configuration for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads static string variables for package metadata; reads the 'long_description' markdown string; reads external dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'setup' function which processes package metadata; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Static variables and function parameters flow into the 'setup' function without external influence; no dynamic execution or data manipulation from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected; the code follows standard setup.py configuration practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, importing only 'setuptools' and defining package metadata. All strings are static and predefined, with no user input or untrusted data. The 'install_requires' and 'package_data' parameters are static lists/dicts, and the setup parameters are constants. No dynamic or executable code that could be malicious is present. The structure and content follow standard package setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
