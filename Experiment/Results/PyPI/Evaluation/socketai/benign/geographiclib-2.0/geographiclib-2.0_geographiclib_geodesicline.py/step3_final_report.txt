  "purpose": "Implementation of geodesic calculations along a geodesic line, enabling position and arc length computations based on starting point and azimuth.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (lat1, lon1, azi1), internal mathematical series and trigonometric functions, class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Internal data flow for calculations; no external data exfiltration, network activity, or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (lat1, lon1, azi1) influence internal series calculations; position and arc length outputs are derived from these internal computations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Uses standard mathematical series and trigonometric functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a direct translation of a reputable geodesic algorithm, performing complex but well-documented mathematical operations. It does not handle external data sources beyond constructor inputs, nor does it perform network or system modifications. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The implementation aligns with known algorithms by Charles Karney, with no suspicious patterns or external vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of geodesic calculations, with no malicious behavior or sabotage. It is transparent, mathematically rigorous, and safe for use. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.2 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
