  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of geodesic calculations, with no malicious behavior or sabotage. It is transparent, mathematically rigorous, and safe for use. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.2 are justified and consistent with the analysis."
