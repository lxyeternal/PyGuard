  "purpose": "Implementation of a geodesic line class for calculating points along a geodesic on an ellipsoid, supporting position calculations by distance or arc length.",
  "sources": "Inputs include constructor parameters (lat1, lon1, azi1, caps, salp1, calp1), method parameters (s12, a12, s13, a13), and internal calculations involving geodesic formulas.",
  "sinks": "Methods output positional data (lat2, lon2, azi2, s12, a12, etc.) but do not directly send untrusted data externally or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (s12, a12, s13, a13) flow into _GenPosition, which computes positional data. These outputs are used in Position, ArcPosition, SetDistance, and SetArc methods to produce results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of mathematical functions appears standard for geodesic calculations. No obfuscated code features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-documented geodesic calculations based on established mathematical algorithms. It reads inputs such as latitudes, longitudes, azimuths, and distances, then performs computations to determine positional points on an ellipsoid. It utilizes series expansions, trigonometric functions, and standard math operations consistent with geodesic formulas. There are no signs of malicious behavior like network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code structure aligns with scientific computation, with no suspicious control flow or unusual data handling. The potential concern might be if the library is used with untrusted input without validation, but within this code, no such issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of geodesic calculations, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a legitimate scientific computation module following established algorithms.",
