{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the geographiclib library, specifically testing geodesic calculations and mathematical functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'geographiclib.geomath' and 'geographiclib.geodesic' modules; standard Python modules sys, math, unittest.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; tests involve mathematical calculations and function outputs without external data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to functions like Math.AngRound, Math.sincosd, Math.atan2d, Math.sum, Math.AngNormalize, Math.AngDiff, and Geodesic.Inverse/Direct methods. Results are used in assertions but do not lead to data leaks or external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is primarily testing mathematical functions and geodesic calculations with expected inputs and outputs. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or unusual variable manipulations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing of mathematical functions and geodesic calculations. It uses standard mathematical and geodesic operations, verifying edge cases, special values (NaN, infinity), and geometric scenarios like antipodal and coincident points. No external data, network access, or file operations are present. The functions tested are well-understood mathematical routines, and no suspicious patterns such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are detected. The use of the geographiclib library and its functions appears legitimate, with tests focusing on correctness and special cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a geodesic library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely computational, testing mathematical correctness and geometric edge cases. No malicious signals, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscated code detected.",
