  "purpose": "Unit tests for the geographiclib library functions, verifying mathematical and geodesic computations.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from test cases with hardcoded values; no external data input observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external system interactions detected.",
  "flows": "N/A - tests operate on fixed inputs and produce assertions; no flow of untrusted data to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises unit tests for geographic calculations, focusing on mathematical functions and geodesic inverse/direct computations. All data inputs are hardcoded within the test cases, with no external data read or network activity. The functions invoked perform mathematical calculations and comparisons; no untrusted input handling or external system calls are present. The structure and formatting are standard for unittest frameworks. No signs of code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for geographic calculations, with no malicious or suspicious behavior present. It appears safe and solely intended for validation purposes.",
