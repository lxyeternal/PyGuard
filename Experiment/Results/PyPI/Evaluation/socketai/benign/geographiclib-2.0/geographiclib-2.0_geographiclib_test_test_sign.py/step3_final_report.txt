{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the geographiclib library, focusing on mathematical correctness, angle normalization, trigonometric functions, and geodesic calculations.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (unittest, math, sys), internal constants, and functions from geographiclib.geomath and geographiclib.geodesic modules.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network connections, file I/O, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The tests invoke internal functions with hardcoded or standard constants, checking their outputs against expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard mathematical and geodesic computations, testing edge cases such as NaN, infinity, and boundary angles. It uses well-known functions and constants, with no external data or system interaction. The structure is typical for unit testing, with assertions verifying correctness. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage is evident. The code's purpose is validation, not system modification or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for the geographiclib library, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1 (reflecting minimal concern due to mathematical testing but no actual threat). Overall, the code poses negligible security risk and is safe for use.",
