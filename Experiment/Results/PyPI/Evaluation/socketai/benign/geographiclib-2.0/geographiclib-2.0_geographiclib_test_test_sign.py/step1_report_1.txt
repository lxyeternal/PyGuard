{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the geographiclib library functions, specifically tests for geodesic calculations and angle normalization methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (unittest, math, sys), imports from geographiclib.geomath and geographiclib.geodesic, and the test cases that generate input data and compare expected outputs.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data externally, executes untrusted input, or interacts with network resources. No data leakage or system modification is present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through the test functions, calling geographiclib methods and comparing their output to expected values, but no untrusted data sources or sink functions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior observed. The code strictly performs mathematical tests and validations. No obfuscated or misleading code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward suite of unit tests for the geographiclib library, focusing on mathematical correctness of angle calculations, trigonometric functions, and geodesic inverse/direct problems. It uses standard Python modules and a reputable open-source library without any suspicious modifications or hidden behavior. No external data sources, network operations, or system modifications are detected. The code structure is typical for testing purposes, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured test suite for geographic calculations. It does not contain any malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. The likelihood of malware is very low, with no signs of sabotage or harmful code.",
