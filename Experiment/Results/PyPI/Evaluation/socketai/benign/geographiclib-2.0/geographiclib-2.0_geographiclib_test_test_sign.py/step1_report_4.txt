  "sinks": "Assertions and mathematical computations; no external data or untrusted input handling beyond tests",
  "flows": "Input data to mathematical functions and assertions; no external untrusted data flow or system commands",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code uses standard libraries and mathematical functions. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for mathematical and geodesic functions from the geographiclib library. It performs various calculations and assertions to verify the correctness of the library's functions, including handling of edge cases like infinities, NaNs, and boundary angles. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or external system interference. The code appears solely designed for testing purposes, with no network calls, file access, or sensitive data handling. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of unit tests for geographiclib functions, with no malicious behavior or security risks present.",
