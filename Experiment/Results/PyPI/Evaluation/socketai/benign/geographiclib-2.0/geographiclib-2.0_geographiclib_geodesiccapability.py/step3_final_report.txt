{
  "purpose": "Defines capability constants for geodesic calculations used in geodesic.py and geodesicline.py modules.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static constant definitions within the class.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or output operations.",
  "flows": "None; constants are used as flags in other parts of the library, but no direct data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward bitwise flag definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a class with static constants representing capability flags for geodesic computations, using standard bitwise operations. It contains no functions, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. The constants are well-documented and typical for such a library. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are justified based on the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of constants for geodesic capabilities, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
