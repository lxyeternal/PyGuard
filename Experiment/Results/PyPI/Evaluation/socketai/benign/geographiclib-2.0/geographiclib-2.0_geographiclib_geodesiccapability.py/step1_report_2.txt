{
  "purpose": "Defines capability constants for geodesic computations, shared between geodesic and geodesic line modules.",
  "sources": "No input sources; constants are hardcoded within the class definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only defines constants without data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code consists solely of constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward constant definitions with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides capability constants for geodesic calculations. It uses bitwise operations to assign values to various capabilities and output masks, following standard practices for such definitions. There are no functions, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors. No indication of obfuscation or malicious intent. The licensing comments and documentation links are typical for open-source projects. No signs of malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard definition of constants for geodesic calculations. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, nor any security risks.",
