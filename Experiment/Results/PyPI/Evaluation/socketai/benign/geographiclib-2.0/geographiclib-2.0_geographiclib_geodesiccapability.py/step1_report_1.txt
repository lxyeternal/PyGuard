{
  "purpose": "Defines capability constants for geodesic calculations, used by geodesic and geodesicline modules.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only constant definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing present; no output or external communication functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; purely constant definitions with bitwise operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class constants with standard bitwise operations, no suspicious logic, code injection, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of constants used for geodesic computations, utilizing bitwise flags for various capabilities and properties. It contains no input handling, data processing, external calls, or code execution, reducing the likelihood of malicious behavior. The constants appear to be standard flags for a geodesic library, and there are no signs of hidden code or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign set of constant definitions for geodesic capabilities. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and purely functional in nature.",
