{
  "purpose": "Define capability constants for geodesic computations used in geodesic and geodesic line modules.",
  "sources": "Constants and class attributes are defined directly within the code; no external data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output functions, no handling of untrusted input or external data streams.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code merely defines static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class defining integer constants for geodesic capabilities, using standard bitwise operations. There are no functions, external data interactions, or control flow constructs. The purpose appears to be static configuration, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The licensing and documentation comments indicate it is part of a geographic library, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign set of constant definitions for geodesic capabilities. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a geographic computation library.",
