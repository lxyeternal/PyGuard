  "purpose": "Define capability constants for geodesic calculations used in geodesic and geodesic line modules.",
  "sources": "Constants definitions within the class; no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; this code solely defines constants without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code present. All constants are clearly defined using straightforward bitwise operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a class with multiple static constants representing capabilities and options for geodesic calculations. It uses bitwise shifts and OR operations to assign flags, which is standard for setting bitmask options. No input/output, no network calls, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a typical constants definition module with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign constants module for geodesic capability flags, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a straightforward configuration class without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
