{
  "purpose": "Defines capability constants for geodesic calculations used in geodesic and geodesic line modules.",
  "sources": "No input sources; defines static constants within a class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present; no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only sets constant values for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class with static constant definitions representing capability flags for geodesic computations. No user input, external data, or dynamic execution exists. The constants are logically named and follow standard bitwise flag conventions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign definition of constants for geodesic capabilities with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
