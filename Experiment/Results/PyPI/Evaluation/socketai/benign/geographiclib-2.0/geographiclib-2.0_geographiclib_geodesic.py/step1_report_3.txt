  "purpose": "Implement a Python class for solving geodesic problems on an ellipsoid, including inverse and direct calculations, along with supporting functions and constants.",
  "sources": "Inputs such as latitudes, longitudes, azimuths, distances, and spherical arc lengths from function parameters; internally computed values such as coefficients, trigonometric series, and auxiliary variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could flow from inputs (e.g., latitudes, longitudes, azimuths) to outputs (e.g., distances, azimuths, scales, areas). Notably, no direct data leakage or network transmission is observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs like latitudes, longitudes, azimuths flow into various calculations, including trigonometric series and Newton iterations, ultimately producing outputs such as distances, azimuths, scales, areas, and coordinate transformations. These flows are typical for geodesic computations and do not suggest malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code is a straightforward mathematical implementation with complex but standard formulas from geodesic algorithms. No signs of obfuscation or hidden code are detected. Use of potentially sensitive data (e.g., environmental variables, external communications) is absent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-documented implementation of geodesic algorithms, based on reputable mathematical methods from literature. It involves multiple private static and instance methods for series evaluations, solving astroid equations, and iterative solutions for inverse problems. The constructor initializes parameters based on ellipsoid constants, with validation for positive, finite values. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. All data flows are within the context of mathematical computations. No obfuscated code segments or malicious payloads are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, mathematical implementation of geodesic calculations with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It functions as a computational library for geodesic problems, without any suspicious side effects or malicious behaviors.",
