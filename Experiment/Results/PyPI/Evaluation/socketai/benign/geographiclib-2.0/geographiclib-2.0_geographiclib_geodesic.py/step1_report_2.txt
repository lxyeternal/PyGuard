  "purpose": "Implement a Python class for solving geodesic problems on an ellipsoid, including inverse and direct calculations, and providing geodesic line objects.",
  "sources": "Data read from input parameters such as lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2, azi1, s12, a12; internal attributes for ellipsoid parameters and mathematical series; potential external dependencies (imported modules).",
  "sinks": "Potential output includes dictionaries with geodesic results; internal calculations produce values like s12, a12, azimuths, scales, areas, but no data is sent externally or over the network; no apparent sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through various mathematical functions and iterative procedures (e.g., Newton's method) to compute geodesic metrics; the flows involve internal computations and return results via dictionaries, with no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a direct, extensive translation of a well-documented C++ geodesic library with numerous mathematical series evaluations and special case handling; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual data handling observed. The code uses a lot of private attributes for mathematical series, consistent with performance optimization. No malicious behaviors or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive class for geodesic calculations based on well-established algorithms. It performs standard geometric computations, including series evaluations, Newton iterations, and special case handling for meridian and equatorial cases. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or sabotage. The imports are for math and internal modules, and the logic follows known geodesic algorithms. The structure and comments align with scientific geodesy code, not malicious obfuscation or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate implementation of a geodesic computation library with no indicators of malicious intent. It uses standard mathematical and geodesic algorithms, does not handle untrusted input insecurely, nor does it contain hidden network activities or backdoors. The code appears safe and purely computational in nature.",
