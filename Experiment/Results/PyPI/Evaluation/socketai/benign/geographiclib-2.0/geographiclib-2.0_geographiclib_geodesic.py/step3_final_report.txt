  "purpose": "Implementation of the Geodesic class for solving geodesic problems based on well-established algorithms, primarily for mathematical and geographic computations.",
  "sources": "Inputs are latitude, longitude, azimuth, and distance parameters; internal computations involve mathematical series and trigonometric functions; no external data sources or untrusted input handling beyond standard parameter passing.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical calculations within the class; no external network, file, or secret data handling; no data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through internal methods involving trigonometric series, iterative solving (Newton's method), and mathematical transformations; results are returned as dictionaries with computed geodesic metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code; implementation aligns with standard geodesic algorithms; no external or network activity; code is well-documented and mathematically derived.",
  "analysis": "The code is a faithful, complex implementation of geodesic algorithms based on reputable literature. It performs internal mathematical computations without external data dependencies or network activity. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and content. The high confidence scores further support the safety assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, scientifically rigorous implementation of geodesic calculations with no malicious intent or security risks. The current security scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the risk score can be set to 0 or at most 0.1 to reflect the complexity but not maliciousness.",
