  "purpose": "Implementation of the Geodesic class for solving geodesic problems on an ellipsoid, including inverse and direct calculations, and creation of geodesic lines and polygons.",
  "sources": "Code reads configuration parameters, floating-point computations, and external modules (geodesiccapability, geomath). No external input sources or user input are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output to untrusted destinations are present. No network, file, or environment variable manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Internal calculations involving trigonometric series, astroid solving, and iterative Newton methods. No external data flow from untrusted sources to sinks. No network or system command execution found.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of floating-point tolerances and iterative algorithms is standard for geodesic calculations. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or misleading variable names detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a complex mathematical model for geodesic calculations, derived from well-documented algorithms. It uses standard techniques such as series evaluation, Newton iteration, and astroid solving. No code shows signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system disruption. External modules are imported for mathematical operations, consistent with normal usage. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden functions. The code appears to be a faithful implementation of geodesic algorithms with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate mathematical implementation of geodesic calculations with no malicious intent. It is a standard, complex scientific library code for geodesic problems. No security risks or malicious behaviors are identified.",
