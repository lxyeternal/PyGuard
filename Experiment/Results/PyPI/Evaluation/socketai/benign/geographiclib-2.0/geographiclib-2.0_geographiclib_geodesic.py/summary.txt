  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, scientifically rigorous implementation of geodesic calculations with no malicious intent or security risks. The current security scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the risk score can be set to 0 or at most 0.1 to reflect the complexity but not maliciousness."
