  "purpose": "Define constants related to the WGS84 ellipsoid for geospatial calculations.",
  "sources": "Constants are hardcoded within the class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward and contains no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static constants representing the WGS84 ellipsoid parameters. It includes no dynamic code, user input, or external data access. No suspicious behavior, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code are present. The comments clarify the purpose but do not influence execution. There are no backdoors, network activity, or credential management. It is a simple, static configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward definition of constants for geospatial calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
