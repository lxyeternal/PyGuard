  "purpose": "Define constants related to the WGS84 ellipsoid for geospatial calculations.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for WGS84 parameters within the Constants class.",
  "lungs": "No explicit data input or external data sources are used.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; constants are static values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class containing static constants for the WGS84 ellipsoid parameters, which are well-known and publicly available geospatial constants. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no code that interacts with system resources or network. The implementation is simple, clear, and consistent with typical Python practices for defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign and standard implementation of geospatial constants with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger geospatial library and is safe to use.",
