{
  "purpose": "Defines constants for the WGS84 ellipsoid used in geospatial calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads class definition and class variables WGS84_a and WGS84_f.",
  "targets": "No evident data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated content observed. The comments and code are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python class defining two constants related to the WGS84 ellipsoid. It includes descriptive comments, licensing information, and does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or network communication. The constants are well-documented and serve as static configuration parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The code is standard and typical for geospatial applications, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward declaration of constants for geospatial calculations. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
