  "purpose": "Define constants related to the WGS84 ellipsoid for geospatial calculations.",
  "sources": "No input data reading; only class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems; no data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only defines static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple class with static constants representing the WGS84 ellipsoid parameters. No input/output operations, external calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The comments and structure are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign definition of geospatial constants with no malicious intent or security risks.",
