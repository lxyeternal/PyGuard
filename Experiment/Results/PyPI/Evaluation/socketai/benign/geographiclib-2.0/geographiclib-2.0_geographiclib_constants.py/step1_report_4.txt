  "purpose": "Define constants related to the WGS84 ellipsoid for geographic calculations.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for WGS84 parameters: WGS84_a and WGS84_f.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class defining static constants for the WGS84 ellipsoid, with clear comments and no dynamic or external data handling. The constants are fixed numeric values representing geospatial parameters, and there are no input, output, or runtime computations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard definition of geospatial constants with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
