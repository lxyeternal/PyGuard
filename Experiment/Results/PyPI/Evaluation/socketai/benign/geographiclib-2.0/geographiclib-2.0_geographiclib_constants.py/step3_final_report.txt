{
  "purpose": "Defines static constants for the WGS84 ellipsoid used in geospatial calculations.",
  "sources": "Static attribute definitions within the Constants class; no external data sources or input mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static constants are used as configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static definitions with clear comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with two static constants representing the Earth's equatorial radius and flattening factor. It contains no input/output, dynamic code, external dependencies, or obfuscation. The code is well-documented and purely declarative. All reviews concur that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its harmless nature. The code's purpose is purely to provide constants for geospatial calculations, with no potential for exploitation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static definition of geospatial constants with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
