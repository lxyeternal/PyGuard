{
  "purpose": "Provide additional mathematical routines for geographic computations, including trigonometric, polynomial evaluation, and angle normalization functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and math modules; static method parameters and constants within class Math.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical calculations using sys.version_info, math functions, and static method parameters; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily internal computations with constants and math functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info to select different methods (e.g., math.hypot vs. math.sqrt), which appears to be a compatibility measure. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Math class with static methods for various mathematical operations. The methods are straightforward, performing mathematical calculations such as squaring, cube root, normalization, polynomial evaluation, angle rounding, and trigonometric functions. The only conditional logic relates to version-based method selection and angle adjustments, which are standard compatibility practices. No external data manipulation, network communication, or data leakage mechanisms are present. No indicators of malicious intent or sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard mathematical utility class intended for geographic calculations. It contains no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. The implementation focuses on correctness and compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of malware or security risks in the analyzed code.",
