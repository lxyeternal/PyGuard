{
  "purpose": "Provide mathematical routines for geographic calculations, ported from C++ to Python.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (sys, math). No external or user input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, no network, file, or environment interactions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks, as the code consists of pure functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. Use of math functions appears standard and safe. Some computations involve floating-point operations that are typical in math libraries, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No obfuscated code patterns or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements mathematical functions such as square, cube root, normalization, polynomial evaluation, angle rounding, and trigonometric calculations in degrees. It uses standard math operations and libraries, with no apparent external data input or output mechanisms. The functions perform straightforward calculations with well-understood mathematical routines. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The only potential concern could be if these functions were used in a malicious context, but as standalone utility code, they are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of mathematical utility functions with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard library translation with no malicious behaviors or security vulnerabilities present.",
