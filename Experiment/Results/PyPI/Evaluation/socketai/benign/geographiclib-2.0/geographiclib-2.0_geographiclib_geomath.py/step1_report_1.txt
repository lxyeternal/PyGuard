{
  "purpose": "Provides additional mathematical routines for GeographicLib, including functions for vector normalization, polynomial evaluation, angle manipulation, and trigonometric calculations in degrees.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and math modules; no external or untrusted input sources are used within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not output data or communicate externally.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mathematical operations are self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of sys.version_info for conditional handling is benign. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a collection of static mathematical functions that perform standard operations such as squaring, cube roots, vector normalization, polynomial evaluation, angle normalization, and trigonometric calculations in degrees. There are no network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. All functions use standard math library functions with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. Conditional handling based on Python version is benign and aimed at accuracy improvements. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, well-structured library for mathematical computations related to geographic calculations. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be a benign utility module intended for use in geographic or geospatial computations.",
