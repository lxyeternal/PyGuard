{
  "purpose": "The code provides static mathematical routines for geographic calculations, including vector normalization, polynomial evaluation, angle normalization, and trigonometric functions in degrees.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data from function arguments; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or system effects; the code performs purely computational tasks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs through mathematical operations within each function; no external or untrusted data flows into or out of the system.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The use of sys.version_info for compatibility is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward mathematical routines with proper handling for numerical stability and compatibility. No external dependencies, network activity, or I/O operations are present. The functions perform standard calculations like vector normalization, polynomial evaluation, and angle conversions. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected, and the implementation aligns with typical utility code for geographic computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for geographic math, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
