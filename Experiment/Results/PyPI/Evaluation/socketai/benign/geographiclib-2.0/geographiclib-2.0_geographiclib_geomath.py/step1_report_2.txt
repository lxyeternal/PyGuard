{
  "purpose": "Provides additional mathematical routines for GeographicLib, including vector normalization, polynomial evaluation, and angle calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (x, y, u, v, p, s, x, y, etc.), system info via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted data only if input parameters are externally provided; no data sinks for external output or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into mathematical functions; no external data is transmitted or stored; functions process inputs locally.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes no unusual behavior, obfuscated code, or hidden logic; the implementation appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard collection of mathematical functions translated from C++ to Python. It performs vector normalization, polynomial evaluation, angle normalization, and trigonometric calculations. No use of external resources, network, or file I/O is present. It relies on Python's math library, and all operations are mathematical computations without side effects. There are no suspicious patterns, no dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors detected. The function `sqr` is trivial, `cbrt` correctly computes cube roots, and angle-related functions handle standard geometric transformations. The only minor consideration is that `sys.version_info` is used for conditional logic, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mathematical utility module without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a straightforward translation of a C++ math class for geographic computations, with no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious code. It poses no security risk.",
