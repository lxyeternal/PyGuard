{
  "purpose": "Provide mathematical utility functions for geographic computations, translating a C++ class into Python.",
  "sources": "Reads only local mathematical constants, functions, and parameters; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sink operations, no data outputs, no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "The functions perform internal calculations and transformations without external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard mathematical functions and geographic angle computations with proper numerical considerations. It uses safe math operations, error-free summation, and angle normalization routines. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears to be a straightforward mathematical utility module with no side effects or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, mathematically oriented utility class for geographic calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this module.",
