  "purpose": "Implementation of a geodesic polygon area calculator based on GeographicLib algorithms, providing methods to add points or edges, compute area, perimeter, and handle polygon or polyline configurations.",
  "sources": "Input points via AddPoint or AddEdge methods, internal geodesic calculations (_GenInverse, _GenDirect), and mathematical functions from geographiclib.geomath and math modules.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network, or file operations; computations are internal and rely on trusted geographiclib functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (lat, lon, azi, s) flows into geodesic functions; results (s12, S12) influence area and perimeter accumulators; no external sinks or data leaks occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected; code is a straightforward implementation of known algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard geodesic polygon calculations using well-established algorithms. It relies on external trusted geographiclib functions for inverse and direct geodesic computations. No network, file, or system calls are present. The logic for adding points or edges, computing area, and handling polygon/polyline distinctions is transparent and consistent. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are evident. The small variations in security risk scores across reports are justified by the potential for misuse if untrusted input is fed into geodesic functions, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of geodesic polygon and polyline area calculations. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
