  "purpose": "Implement a class for calculating geodesic polygon and polyline areas on an ellipsoid using geographiclib.",
  "sources": "Input data includes parameters passed to methods such as lat, lon, azi, s, and internally generated geodesic calculations via _GenInverse and _GenDirect methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write to files, send data over the network, or execute system commands. No dangerous sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in geodesic computations that generate vertices and edge lengths. No flow leads to untrusted data influencing system state or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors. The code is well-structured, uses standard math and geographiclib functions, and performs geodesic calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a geodesic polygon area calculator with methods for adding points and edges, and computing area and perimeter. It includes static methods for handling longitude crossings and area reductions. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, system commands, or external data leaks. Usage of geographiclib for geodesic calculations is standard for such applications. No external network or file I/O, no suspicious data handling observed. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of geodesic polygon area calculations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of a geodesic polygon area calculator with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It performs geometric calculations using geographiclib without engaging in any suspicious or harmful operations.",
