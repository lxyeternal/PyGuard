  "purpose": "Implementation of a geodesic polygon area calculation class based on GeographicLib algorithms.",
  "sources": "Methods that access self properties (AddPoint, AddEdge, Compute, TestPoint, TestEdge), and external calls to self.earth._GenInverse and self.earth._GenDirect.",
  "sinks": "External geodesic computations potentially process untrusted input via self properties, but no explicit untrusted data handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "User calls AddPoint/AddEdge with coordinates, which update internal state; Compute/Test methods use internal state and external geodesic functions to calculate area/perimeter; no direct data flow from untrusted source to sink beyond internal computations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious file operations, network access, or credential handling. All code appears standard for geographic calculations.",
  "analysis": "The class implements geodesic polygon calculations using geographiclib functions, with proper handling of edge cases, no hardcoded credentials or secrets. No input/output operations suggest data leaks. All external interactions are through well-defined geodesic functions, and there are no indications of malicious code or sabotage. Code structure is consistent and transparent. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented geographic computation class with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It relies on external, trusted geographiclib functions without processing untrusted data in a suspicious manner.",
