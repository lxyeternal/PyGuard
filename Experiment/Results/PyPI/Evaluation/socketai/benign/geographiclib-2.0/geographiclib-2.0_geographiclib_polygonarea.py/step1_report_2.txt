  "purpose": "Implement a geodesic polygon and polyline area calculation class based on GeographicLib algorithms.",
  "sources": "Methods calling external libraries: _GenInverse, _GenDirect, Math.AngDiff, Math.AngNormalize, Math.remainder; attribute access on self.earth; constants for geodesic computations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no network operations, file I/O, or system command executions observed.",
  "flows": "Input points or edges (via AddPoint, AddEdge, TestPoint, TestEdge) are processed through geodesic calculations to update internal accumulators, which are then used in Compute or Test methods to produce area/perimeter data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code detected. Use of mathematical functions appears standard. No suspicious data flows or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class for geodesic polygon and polyline area calculation, relying on the geographiclib library. It performs complex geometric calculations with no external data input/output. All methods use internal attribute updates and math functions, with no network or file access. The methods implement standard geodesic algorithms and accumulator logic. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of geodesic polygon calculations, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard algorithms and does not contain suspicious behaviors.",
