  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no obfuscation, no secrets, no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package. It performs static file reading and calls setuptools.setup() with fixed parameters. No network activity, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns. All signals indicate benign, standard packaging practice.",
  "conclusion": "The script is safe, benign, and follows best practices. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
