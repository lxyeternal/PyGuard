{
  "purpose": "This is a setup script for configuring the packaging and distribution of the 'geographiclib' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; reads input from the file system during package setup.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written or transmitted based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads from the filesystem to obtain package description; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The script appears to follow standard Python packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for Python packaging. It imports 'setuptools', reads the README file for long description, and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with package metadata. All operations are standard and do not include any dynamic code execution, external network calls, or suspicious logic. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration.",
