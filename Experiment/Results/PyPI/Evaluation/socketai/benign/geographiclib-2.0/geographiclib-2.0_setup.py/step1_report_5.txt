  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No external network connections or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. It reads a local file 'README.md' for the long description, then calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata about the package. All data is hardcoded or read from trusted files, and no untrusted input is processed. The script follows common packaging practices without any suspicious behavior or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
