  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup.py script with no malicious behavior, no external data fetching, and no suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the code is standard packaging code with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, it describes a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code execution or network activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, no suspicious code is identified.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **However:** The report assigns a SecurityRisk score of 0.1, citing \"standard package setup\" but possibly considering the act of reading files as a minor risk.  \n- **Justification:** Reading local files like README.md is standard and low risk, and does not introduce security issues.  \n- **Verdict:** The SecurityRisk score should remain at 0, as no real risk exists here.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard setup script with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The malware score is appropriately set to 0 across all reports.\n- Obfuscation is correctly marked as 0.\n- SecurityRisk is 0 in all but one report (Report 4), which assigns 0.1. Given the benign nature, this should be 0.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **SecurityRisk score:** Should be 0 for all, since reading static files and calling setup functions are standard practices with no security implications.\n\n### Overall:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The code is a typical, benign setup.py script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a straightforward package setup script with no security concerns.",
