  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration file for packaging and distributing the geographiclib Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "Reads local file (README.md) -> uses this data in package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, dynamic code execution, or hidden behavior observed. Uses standard setuptools setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It reads a local file (README.md) for long description and calls setuptools.setup() with static, hardcoded metadata. No suspicious imports, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present. The use of well-known packages and typical setup conventions reduces the likelihood of malicious intent. No embedded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply reads a README file and configures package metadata for distribution.",
