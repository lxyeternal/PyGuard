  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of variable assignments: `__version_info__`, `__version__`, and `__release_date__`.\n   - No input/output, data processing, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no code that could be malicious.\n   - The code is straightforward, serving as metadata for the package.\n\n2. **Evaluation of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely metadata, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The analysis in each report correctly states that there are no anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The confidence level in each report is 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is accurate.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Claims:**\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behavior are made.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior are present; the code is transparent.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is benign, serving as metadata.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n   - No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall understanding that the code is purely informational and carries no security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward declaration of package metadata with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and should remain as-is.",
