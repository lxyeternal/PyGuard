  "purpose": "Defines package version information and release date as metadata variables.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments (__version_info__, __version__, __release_date__).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static assignments without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward metadata, no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable declarations for version info and release date, serving as package metadata. No input handling, external data fetching, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. All reviews agree on its benign nature, with high confidence (score 1). No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's purpose as metadata. The code is transparent, straightforward, and poses no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving purely as package metadata with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
