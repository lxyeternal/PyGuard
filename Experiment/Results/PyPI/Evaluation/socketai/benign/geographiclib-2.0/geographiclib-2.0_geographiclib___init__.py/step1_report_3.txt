  "purpose": "To provide version information and metadata about the GeographicLib package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code as it does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since the code only contains variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code consists solely of version and release date definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining version information and release date variables for the library. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable logic. The metadata is standard for open-source Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to declare metadata variables for the library. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
