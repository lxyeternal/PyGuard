  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review**:\n   - The code only contains variable assignments for version info and release date.\n   - There are no inputs, external data fetching, code execution, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No secrets, credentials, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for package metadata.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence score is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on static inspection.\n   - The purpose is purely metadata declaration, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard metadata snippet for a Python package.\n   - It poses no security risks or malware concerns.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect that.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
