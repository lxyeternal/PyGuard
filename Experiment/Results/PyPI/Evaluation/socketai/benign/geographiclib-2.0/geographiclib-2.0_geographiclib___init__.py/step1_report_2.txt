  "purpose": "Defines version and release date information for the GeographicLib package, likely for metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or data input occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or written to outside systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, defining static variables; no unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of metadata definitions for a Python package, including version info and release date. There are no input operations, data processing, or external interactions. The variables are static and serve documentation or version control purposes. No malicious constructs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to provide versioning information about GeographicLib. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
