  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is straightforward: it defines static variables for version info and release date.\n   - No input handling, external data fetching, dynamic code execution, or any other complex logic.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or hidden behaviors.\n   - The code is typical for package metadata files.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Findings:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is purely metadata, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify the code's purpose as defining versioning and release date variables.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0 in each report, aligning with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n   - There are no claims of vulnerabilities, suspicious behavior, or malicious intent.\n   - No anomalies or unusual patterns are detected.\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n4. **Conclusion & Final Scoring:**\n   - The code is benign, serving only as metadata.\n   - No risk or malware scores should be increased.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, this code is entirely benign, and the reports are accurate.**",
