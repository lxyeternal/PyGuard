  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for invalid provider errors and translation errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing occurring.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of two class definitions for exceptions; no anomalies or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no external data sources, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. The classes serve as exception types for error handling. The code appears straightforward, clean, and typical for Python projects. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple and standard definition of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
