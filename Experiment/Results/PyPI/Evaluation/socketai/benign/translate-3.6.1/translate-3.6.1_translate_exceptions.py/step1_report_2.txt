  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to invalid providers and translation issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward; no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class. There are no data inputs, external calls, or suspicious patterns. The classes are simple and serve as error indicators within larger codebases. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines exception classes without any malicious content or security vulnerabilities. It does not pose any threat or risk.",
