  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe provided code consists solely of two class definitions for custom exceptions:\n```python\nclass InvalidProviderError(Exception):\n    pass\n\nclass TranslationError(Exception):\n    pass\n```\nNo data sources, sinks, flows, or operations are present. The classes are straightforward and serve as error indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  No. The code only defines exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is simple, standard, and free of anomalies or malicious content. Their reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned appropriate?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - Confidence: 1\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0\n\n  These seem reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since the code only defines exception classes with no external interactions, the malware score should be **0**. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is straightforward with no obfuscation; score of **0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of **0** is justified.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's simplicity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The code poses no security risk or malware concern.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are correct, and the code is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a straightforward, safe code snippet defining custom exceptions with no security concerns.",
