  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of two class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward and typical for Python projects.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of data sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, or suspicious patterns. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1 (or 1.0), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct because the code contains no malicious behavior.  \n- **SecurityRisk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\nSince the code is benign, these scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nNo report assigns a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate. The code is purely definitional with no security implications.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports assign malware = 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as simple class definitions without external interactions or suspicious patterns.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across all reports, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk associated with defining exception classes.\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
