  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in Python.",
  "sources": "No data sources; code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows; classes are simple definitions without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, serving as custom error types. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, nor any suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is standard, clear, and free of obfuscation or security issues. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign confidence scores of 1, and set malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores to 0. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
