  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for invalid provider errors and translation errors",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines exception classes",

  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code only declares exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple class definitions with no suspicious behavior or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. These classes are typical in Python for custom error handling. There are no inputs, data processing, external calls, or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscation or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign definition of exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks.",
