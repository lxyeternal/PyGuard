  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for invalid provider and translation errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; the code defines classes only",
  "sinks": "No data output or external system interaction present",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are only class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class declarations with no unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code declares two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. These classes are likely used elsewhere in a larger project for error handling related to provider validation and translation issues. The code does not include any input handling, external connections, or suspicious constructs. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are present in these class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It serves as a foundation for exception handling in a larger codebase. No malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
