  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of two simple class definitions inheriting from `Exception`. There are no data sources, sinks, flows, or operations, which aligns with the original code. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning. They correctly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for defining custom exceptions. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - SecurityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all scores are zero for malware and security risk, and the code is purely definitional, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions, does not contain obfuscated code, nor does it include suspicious patterns. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent, external data, or hidden behavior. They base their conclusions solely on the code's content.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, benign snippet defining two custom exception classes. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless definition of custom exceptions with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
