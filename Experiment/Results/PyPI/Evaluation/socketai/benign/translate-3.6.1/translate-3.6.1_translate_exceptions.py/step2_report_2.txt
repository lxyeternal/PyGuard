  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of two simple class definitions inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no data sources, sinks, flows, or processing logic present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n   - The code is standard for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that there are no malicious behaviors or security issues.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The analysis in each report is thorough and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (fully confident that the code is benign)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malicious activity)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risks)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely definitional with no external interactions, no data processing, and no suspicious patterns, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n   - The code does not introduce any supply chain risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - The reports correctly challenge any assumptions about malicious intent; they find none.\n   - No overestimations of risk or malware are present.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Final Assessment:**\n   - The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n   - Given the code's simplicity, the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity or code behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No adjustments are necessary.",
