  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to invalid providers and translation failures.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output handling occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; simple class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception base class. There are no operations, data handling, or logic that could be malicious. The class definitions are straightforward and serve as custom error types. No hardcoded credentials, external calls, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, benign snippet defining custom exception classes. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk present.",
