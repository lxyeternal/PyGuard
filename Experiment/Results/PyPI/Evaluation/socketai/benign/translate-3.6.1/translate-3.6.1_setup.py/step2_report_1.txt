  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script reading changelog, version, README, requirements.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Reads and writes files; no untrusted data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, standard setup script, no malicious behavior, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is straightforward, and no malware or security issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on version management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Reads files, updates version file, prints version info.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard setup script, no malicious activity, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code performs typical package setup tasks without any signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with focus on version extraction and updating.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Reads changelog, updates version.py, CLI output.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic execution or network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard, safe setup script, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, emphasizing reading and writing version info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Reads files, updates version.py, CLI version display.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Typical setup script, no security risks, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup, reading files, updating version.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Reads files, updates version.py, no untrusted input processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Typical, safe setup script, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** **0** — All reports agree there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** **0** — The code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the above, the overall security risk is negligible, likely **0**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard setup script, performing version management, reading dependencies, and configuring package metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- The version update mechanism is safe, relying on file reads and regex parsing.\n- The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
