  "purpose": "This script manages package versioning, reads changelog, README, requirements, and sets up package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads changelog, README, requirements files, and version info from version.py",
  "sinks": "Reads and writes files; updates version.py with new version number",
  "flows": "Reads changelog to extract version -> updates version.py with new version -> outputs version info",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no network activity, no obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It reads version info from changelog and updates version.py accordingly. It loads package metadata, requirements, and documentation files, then configures setup parameters. No untrusted data is executed or transmitted. The version update involves regex parsing and file I/O, which are safe. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The script performs typical package setup tasks without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is negligible (0).",
