  "purpose": "Define and export the Translator class and version string for a package/module",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.translate and .version)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external output",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules are straightforward; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Translator class and a version string from local modules, then exposes them via __all__ for module exports. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data handling from untrusted sources. The code appears to be a simple module interface definition with standard Python syntax and conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply exposes components of a package for external use.",
