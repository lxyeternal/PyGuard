  "purpose": "Defines module exports for a package, exposing Translator and __version__ variables.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .translate and .version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules, no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. It does not process or handle any user input or external data. The use of relative imports suggests a package structure, which is normal. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this minimal code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initializer, exposing internal components. No malicious activity, no security risks detected.",
