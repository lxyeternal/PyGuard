  "purpose": "Define public API exports for a Python package, exposing a Translator class and version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.translate and .version)",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flows",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is standard for package internal structure; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Translator class from a local module and a version string from another local module. It then defines __all__ for explicit API exports. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The code appears to be a straightforward module initialization file, typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package boilerplate without any malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply exposes internal modules for public use.",
