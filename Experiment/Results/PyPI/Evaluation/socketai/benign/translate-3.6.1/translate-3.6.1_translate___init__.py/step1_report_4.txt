  "purpose": "Export the Translator class and version information for the package",
  "sources": "Import statements for .translate and .version modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; code only imports modules and sets __all__",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or external data manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple module import and export setup, no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code only imports two internal modules and defines the __all__ list. It does not process or handle any data, nor does it contain any network activity, system modification, or hidden behaviors. The import statements are relative and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The overall structure is minimal and typical for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization file that exports specific components. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
