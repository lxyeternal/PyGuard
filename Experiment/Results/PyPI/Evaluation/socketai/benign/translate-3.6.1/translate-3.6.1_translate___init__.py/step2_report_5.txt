  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal module initializer, importing internal components and exposing them via `__all__`. The code does not process external data, handle user input, or perform any operations beyond imports and exports.\n\n2. **Malicious activity and anomalies:**  \n   None of the reports find any anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward, with standard relative imports and explicit exports, typical for Python package `__init__.py` files.\n\n3. **Security risks and data flows:**  \n   There are no data flows involving untrusted sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets. The code is static and intended for package setup.\n\n4. **Scores assigned:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Obfuscated: 0.0\n   - Malware: 0.0\n   - Security risk: 0.0\n\n   These seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n5. **Potential points of contention:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly concluding that this code snippet is benign.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious or malicious behavior that warrants a higher malware or risk score.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThis code is a standard, minimal package initializer. All evidence points to a benign, well-structured module setup with no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the reports' assessments. The scores are reasonable and accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis code snippet is safe and typical for Python package initialization.",
