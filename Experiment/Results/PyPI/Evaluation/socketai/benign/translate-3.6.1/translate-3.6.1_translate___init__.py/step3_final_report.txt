{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing internal components and exposing them via __all__ for package exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.translate, .version)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; only internal module references",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py or module setup file that imports internal symbols and exposes them via __all__. It contains no data processing, user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
