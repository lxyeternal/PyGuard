  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module initializer that imports internal components and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No untrusted data handling, external data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution is mentioned.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are observed.\n- The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or module export file in a Python package.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are minimal and contain only import statements and an `__all__` declaration.\n- The sources are local modules (`.translate`, `.version`, `translate`, `version`), which is normal for package internal structure.\n- The absence of any data processing, user input handling, or external communication indicates very low security risk.\n\n**Scores assigned in reports:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity or behavior is evident.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.0 — no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — all reports are in agreement that the code is benign.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this code is a standard module setup with no security concerns.\n- No reason to increase the malware or security risk scores.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious indicators.\n- The obfuscated score is also correctly at 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a typical, benign Python module initializer with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nAll evidence supports that this code is safe and standard.",
