  "purpose": "Entry point script that imports and executes the main function from a local module.",

  "sinks": "Execution of the 'main()' function, which could contain untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> call to main() function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward entry point pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal entry point that imports 'main' from a local module and executes it. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The security profile depends on the contents of the 'main' function in the 'main' module, which is not provided. Based solely on this script, no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point that executes a main function from a local module with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. The overall risk is low, assuming the 'main' function is benign.",
