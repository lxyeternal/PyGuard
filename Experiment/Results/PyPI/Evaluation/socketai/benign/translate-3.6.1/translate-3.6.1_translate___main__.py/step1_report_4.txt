{
  "purpose": "This code imports and executes the main function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code sources data and behavior from the imported 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "The main() function is called directly; potential sinks depend on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Execution flow is straightforward: import 'main' and call main().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present in this minimal script.",
  "analysis": "The script is very simple, only importing and executing a function from a local module. No external data, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns are visible. Since the behavior depends entirely on 'main', which is not provided, it's impossible to determine its nature; however, the code structure itself is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic entry point that runs the main() function from a local module. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks in its current form.",
