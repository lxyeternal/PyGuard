{
  "purpose": "The script is a simple entry point that imports and executes the 'main' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.main' module; invocation of 'main()' function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' which could contain untrusted data handling or side effects, but not visible here.",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> call to main() function; actual data flow depends on 'main()' implementation, which is not provided.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal script that imports a 'main' function from a relative module and executes it immediately. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The behavior is typical of Python entry-point scripts. Without the implementation of 'main()', we cannot assess internal logic, but based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python script that acts as an entry point for a larger application. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this code fragment.",
