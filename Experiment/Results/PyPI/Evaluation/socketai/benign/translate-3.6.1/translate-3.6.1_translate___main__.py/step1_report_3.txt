  "purpose": "Entry point that imports and executes the main function from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package: 'from .main import main'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'main()' function, which could perform any actions depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' from the local module to execution via 'main()' call.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is minimal and standard for a Python package entry point.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard entry point that imports the 'main' function from a local module named 'main' and executes it. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, code obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials. Its simplicity suggests it's a typical package launcher without embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple entry point to execute a main function. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this minimal snippet.",
