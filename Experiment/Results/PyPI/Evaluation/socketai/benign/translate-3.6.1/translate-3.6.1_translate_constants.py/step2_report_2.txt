  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code only assigns static string constants related to configuration parameters.\n- None mention dynamic code execution, input handling, network operations, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n- The use of '~' in the file path is noted as standard for home directory notation but not expanded within these snippets, which is typical in configuration files.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is just static assignments with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  No. All reports are accurate in their assessment that this is benign configuration code.\n- **Potential oversight?**  \n  Slightly, but not critical. The reports do not mention that the tilde (~) in the path may need expansion in actual code to avoid runtime errors, but this is not a security concern per se.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports — appropriate, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports — appropriate, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 — appropriate, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since all code is static configuration with no dynamic or external interactions, raising the malware or risk scores would be unjustified.\n- The only minor note is the tilde in the path, which may require expansion, but this is a configuration detail, not a security concern.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is straightforward configuration with no malicious or obfuscated content, and no security risks.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippets are safe, standard configuration constants with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
