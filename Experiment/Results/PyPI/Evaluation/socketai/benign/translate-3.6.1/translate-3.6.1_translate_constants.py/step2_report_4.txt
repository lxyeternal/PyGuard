  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe static assignment of configuration constants related to a translation tool.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network operations, or data processing are involved.\n- The use of '~' in file paths is noted but is standard and does not imply expansion or execution in this context.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present in any report.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets are straightforward constant assignments. They do not contain executable logic or dynamic operations, so no issues with code correctness or security.\n- **Malware presence:** All reports assign static strings; none indicate any malicious behavior or payload.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risks:** No risks identified; the code is purely configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Issues or errors:\n- **In all reports:** The logic is sound; no errors or flaws are present.\n- **Potential oversight:** The use of '~' in the path string is common but may require expansion in actual code to resolve to an absolute path. However, as per the reports, this is acknowledged and not considered a security concern here.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports have malware = 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Any unreasonable scores?**  \nNo, all scores seem appropriate given the content.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports are purely static configuration with no dynamic or external interactions, the risk score should remain at 0.  \n- A higher score would imply some potential security concern, which is not supported here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all reports — correct.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the consistent evidence across all reports, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippets are benign configuration constants with no security issues. The reports are accurate in their assessments. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The scores are appropriate, and the analysis is thorough.",
