  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for a translation tool or module",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting file path and default parameters",
  "sinks": "No data processing, input, or output operations present",
  "flows": "None, as there are only static assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is simple configuration constants",
  "analysis": "The code declares three constants related to configuration: a file path with a user directory shortcut, a default provider string, and a default translation source language. There is no user input handling, no data flow, and no dynamic execution. The use of '~' in a file path is standard for user home directories but may need expansion in actual code to avoid errors. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present in these assignments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward configuration settings with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
