  "sources": "Static string assignments defining configuration constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static constants, no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '~' in file path string without expansion; no code execution or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for configuration purposes. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present. The tilde (~) in the file path is a common notation for home directory but is not expanded here; this could cause runtime issues if used directly without expansion, but it is not a security concern. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is also 0, given the static, non-executable nature of the code. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting clarity and straightforwardness. No issues or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static configuration snippet with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The current scores are justified and accurate. The only minor note is the use of '~' in the path string, which may require expansion in actual application code but does not constitute a security risk.",
