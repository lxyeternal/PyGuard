  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets constant configuration values: file path, provider, and language. The path uses a home directory shortcut but is not expanded or used for I/O within this snippet. No input reading, no data processing, no network communication. The code appears to be a configuration stub, not executable logic. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a benign configuration setup with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
