  "purpose": "Define default configuration parameters for a translation tool or library.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignment indicating configuration file path and default translation provider.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive operations; purely constant assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors. The file path uses a tilde for home directory expansion, which is common and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to configuration constants, including a user configuration file path, a translation provider, and a default source language. There are no dynamic inputs, network operations, or potentially malicious constructs. No obfuscated code, code injection points, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of a tilde in the path is standard for home directory expansion in many environments and does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, setting configuration defaults with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger application setup and contains no signs of malware or security risks.",
