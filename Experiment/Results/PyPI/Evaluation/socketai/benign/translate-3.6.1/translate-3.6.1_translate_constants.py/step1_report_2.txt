  "purpose": "Define default configuration parameters for a translation utility, including config file path, provider, and source language.",
  "sources": "The code assigns static string values to constants; no external data input is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code segment.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing logic; only static assignments are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns fixed string values to constants that likely serve as default settings for a translation application. The use of a tilde (~) in the config file path indicates a user home directory expansion, but as it is a string, it does not perform expansion by itself. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior evident. The code appears to be safe and standard configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration snippet setting default parameters with no malicious intent or security issues.",
