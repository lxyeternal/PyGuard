  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to the __version__ variable. It involves no input handling, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. The confidence level is 1, given the straightforwardness of the code and the absence of any suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and require no adjustments.",
  "confidence": 1,
