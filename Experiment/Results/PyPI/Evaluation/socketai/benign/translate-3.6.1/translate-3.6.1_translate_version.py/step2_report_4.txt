  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"3.6.1\"`.\n   - This is a standard practice in Python packages for versioning.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual patterns are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code snippets are minimal and benign.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious logic are detected.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as standard version declarations.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is just a static string assignment, there is no basis for malware or obfuscation.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is straightforward, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - The scores are reasonable and justified.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The scores are appropriate, and there are no inconsistencies or overlooked issues. The code is a typical version string assignment with no security concerns.",
