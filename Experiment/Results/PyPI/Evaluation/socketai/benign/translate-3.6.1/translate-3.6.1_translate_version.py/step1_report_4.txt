  "purpose": "The code defines a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only assigns a version string; no unusual or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "This code fragment simply assigns a string to the variable '__version__'. It is a common practice in Python packages for version tracking. No external data, no processing, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious activity are present. The minimal nature indicates no obfuscation or malicious intent. Since the code is straightforward and conventional, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
