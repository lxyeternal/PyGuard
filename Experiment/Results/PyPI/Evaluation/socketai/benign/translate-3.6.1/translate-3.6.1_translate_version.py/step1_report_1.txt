  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string to the __version__ variable, which is a common practice in Python packages to specify their version. There are no input sources, no sinks that process untrusted data, and no complex or suspicious logic. The code is minimal and standard with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for versioning in Python packages, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
