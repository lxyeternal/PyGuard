  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API client for MyMemory translation with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to missing error handling. It can be considered safe for use with minor robustness improvements."
