  "purpose": "Integrate with MyMemory translation API to provide translations.",
  "sources": "Input data: 'text' parameter passed to '_make_request'; configuration data: 'email', 'from_lang', 'to_lang' from kwargs.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call, sending 'params' which may include email and text data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' -> '_make_request' constructs 'params' -> 'requests.get' sends data -> response processed in 'get_translation' to extract translation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; usage of standard requests library; no unusual code structures or obfuscation; no code injection or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper for MyMemory translation service. It reads configuration parameters like 'email' and language settings from kwargs, constructs HTTP GET requests, and processes JSON responses to extract translation data. The only data transmitted over the network is standard request parameters, including optional email for increased quota. No suspicious or malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection is evident. The code relies on external API response structures, which are standard for such services. Overall, this appears to be a benign, well-structured API wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical API client for translation purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The use of requests for network communication is standard, and no sensitive data is hardcoded or leaked. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
