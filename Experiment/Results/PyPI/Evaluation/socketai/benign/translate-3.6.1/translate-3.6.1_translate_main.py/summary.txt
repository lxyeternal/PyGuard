  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious CLI translation utility with no signs of supply chain or malicious activity. The primary security concern is plaintext storage of secrets, which should be addressed but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the obfuscation score is appropriate at 0. The overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
