  "purpose": "A CLI translation utility that manages configuration files, prompts user input, and invokes an external Translator class to perform translations.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration file at CONFIG_FILE_PATH, user input prompts for language settings, and command-line arguments for text to translate.",
  "sinks": "Outputs translation results to the console; writes configuration data to a plaintext config file.",
  "flows": "Configuration data is read from files and user prompts; translation is performed via Translator; results are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. Handling of 'secret_access_key' involves storing in plaintext, which is a security concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for translation, with standard library usage and no signs of malicious behavior. External dependency 'Translator' is assumed legitimate. The main security concern is plaintext storage of secrets, which is a known security issue but not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk around 0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious CLI translation utility with no signs of supply chain or malicious activity. The primary security concern is plaintext storage of secrets, which should be addressed but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the obfuscation score is appropriate at 0. The overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
