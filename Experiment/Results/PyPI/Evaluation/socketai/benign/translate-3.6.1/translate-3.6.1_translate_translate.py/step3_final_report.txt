{
  "purpose": "The code defines a translation utility class supporting multiple providers, validating provider names, wrapping large texts, and translating in chunks via provider-specific methods.",
  "sources": "Input text passed to translate(), provider class instantiation with parameters like secret_access_key and region.",
  "sinks": "The get_translation() method called on provider instances; potential if provider implementations are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input text -> wrapped into chunks -> each chunk passed to provider.get_translation() -> concatenated into final translation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; reliance on external provider classes which are not shown.",
  "analysis": "The code is syntactically correct, validates provider input, and processes large texts in chunks. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident within this snippet. The main risk depends on provider implementations, which are external. The code does not handle secrets securely within this snippet but passes them to providers. No signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are detected here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk is low, primarily due to reliance on external provider classes. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting external dependency concerns.",
