{
  "purpose": "A translation utility class that wraps different translation providers to translate text between languages.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through the translate() method parameter 'text'. Accesses provider class configurations during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if provider classes perform unsafe operations; no direct sink usage visible in this code.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from translate() method to provider.get_translation() call after wrapping; provider configuration data is set during __init__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a translation class with provider selection and text processing. No suspicious code is evident; provider classes are imported but not shown, so their behavior cannot be assessed here. The code appears to be standard, with proper exception handling for invalid providers and no suspicious input handling or data leaks. Use of wrap() limits input size, but this is standard practice. No malware signatures or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a translation interface without malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
