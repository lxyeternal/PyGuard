{
  "purpose": "The code sets up imports and exports for Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage client libraries and types, facilitating interaction with Google Cloud services.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules, classes, and version information; no data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that process untrusted data; primarily module imports and definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely setup and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments, version assignment, and import/export statements for Google Cloud client libraries. It does not process or handle data directly. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. The use of official Google Cloud libraries and standard Python syntax indicates legitimate setup code for a client library module.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module setup for Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage API clients, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and legitimate code for defining package exports.",
