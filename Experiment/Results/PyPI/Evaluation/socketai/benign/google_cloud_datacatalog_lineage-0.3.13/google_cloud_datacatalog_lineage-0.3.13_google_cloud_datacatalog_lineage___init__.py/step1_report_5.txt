  "purpose": "This code provides Python module imports and exports for Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage client libraries, facilitating interaction with the Data Catalog API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external packages (google.cloud.datacatalog_lineage, google.cloud.datacatalog_lineage_v1)",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; code mainly involves static imports and exports",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only imports modules and defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup for a client library, importing specific classes and functions from the Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage SDK and exposing them via __all__. There are no user inputs, no network or data manipulation, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious behavior. The code is purely structural and organizational, aligning with typical SDK design patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward library import and export setup with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not perform any harmful actions.",
