  "purpose": "The code serves as an initialization module for the google.cloud.datacatalog_lineage library, importing version info and specific classes for use in other modules or applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.datacatalog_lineage and google.cloud.datacatalog_lineage_v1 packages, including version info and API classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no functions or methods that process untrusted inputs are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard library import and export statements with versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module setup for a Google Cloud client library. It imports version info and API classes from the official google.cloud.datacatalog_lineage package. No user input handling, data processing, or network communication occurs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The license comments and copyright info are standard for open-source Google code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard setup module for a client library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It simply organizes imports and exports for library use.",
