{
  "purpose": "This code module imports version information and API classes/types for the Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage SDK, and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from google.cloud.datacatalog_lineage and related modules, reading version info and class/type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or write to files.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard SDK setup module with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, version assignment, and an __all__ list, typical for a Python package's __init__.py. It does not handle user input, perform network communication, or execute dynamic code. The structure and content are consistent with a benign, well-defined SDK component. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate Python module for a Google Cloud SDK client library, with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is safe for inclusion in supply chain workflows.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
