  "purpose": "This code provides package metadata and licensing information, serving as a header for a Python module.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = \"0.3.13\") and licensing comments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static metadata only",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or dynamic behavior present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, and standard for package headers",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no functions, data processing, input/output, or dynamic code. It is a static, metadata-only fragment typical for open-source packages. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and security risk score to 0. Confidence levels are high, and scores are consistent with the code content. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package header containing no malicious or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or investigation is necessary.",
