  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code in question.\n\n**Code Content Summary:**\n- Licensing comments (Apache 2.0 License)\n- A version string assignment: `__version__ = \"0.3.13\"`\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a standard header typically found in Python package modules.\n- It contains no executable logic, data handling, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The licensing comments are standard and do not contain malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Metadata/license declaration.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is straightforward, with no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard licensing and version info.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar analysis; metadata/license info.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior or security issues.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: licensing comments, version assignment.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above; standard header.\n- Conclusion: No malicious or security concerns.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that this is metadata/license information with no executable or suspicious content.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** None observed. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores and Justifications:**\n  - **Malware Score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0, no obfuscation detected.\n  - **Risk Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Since this is purely metadata, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted; the code is straightforward.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of My Assessment:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                                  |\n|--------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious code, behavior, or indicators present.            |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.               |\n| Security Risk      | 0      | No security issues, no data handling, no external interactions.|\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.**",
