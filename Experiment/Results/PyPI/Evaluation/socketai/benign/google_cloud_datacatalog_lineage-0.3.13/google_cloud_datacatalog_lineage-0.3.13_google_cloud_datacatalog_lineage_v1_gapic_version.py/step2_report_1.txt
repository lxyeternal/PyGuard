  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely metadata: comments, licensing info, and a version string assignment.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic behavior, input/output handling, network calls, or any executable logic beyond the assignment of `__version__`.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate for open-source Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that there's no malicious activity, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code contains no malicious logic or behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard license header with a version variable, presenting no security concern.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis is a safe, non-malicious piece of code.",
