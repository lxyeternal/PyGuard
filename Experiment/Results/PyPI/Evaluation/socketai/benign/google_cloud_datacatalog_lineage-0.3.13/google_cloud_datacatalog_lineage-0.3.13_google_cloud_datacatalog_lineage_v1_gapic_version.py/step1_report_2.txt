{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata information for a Python package or module, such as version and licensing details.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or data acquisition present).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data processing or output actions).",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since the code only contains comments and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious patterns observed. The licensing comments and version variable are standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical header for a Python source file, including licensing information, copyright notice, and versioning. It does not include any input handling, data processing, or network operations. The only executable line assigns a version string to __version__, which is standard practice for package metadata. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard package metadata with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
