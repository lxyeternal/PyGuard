  "purpose": "This code serves as a metadata header for an open-source Python package, including licensing information and a version identifier.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ and comments containing licensing details.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not interact with external systems or perform data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist, as the code is static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, licensing information, and a version string assignment. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. The confidence scores are appropriately set to 1, and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are detected or inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license header with a version variable, presenting no security concerns or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's static, metadata-only content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
