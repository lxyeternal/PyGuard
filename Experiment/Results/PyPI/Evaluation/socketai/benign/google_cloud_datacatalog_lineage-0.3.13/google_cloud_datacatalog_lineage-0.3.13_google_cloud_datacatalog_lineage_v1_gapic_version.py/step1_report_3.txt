  "purpose": "This code appears to set metadata and licensing information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are read; metadata is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that process untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply defines constants and comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard boilerplate for licensing and versioning; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments and a version string assignment, which are typical for package metadata. No dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions are present. It is consistent with common open-source license headers. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard license and version header with no malicious intent or security risks.",
