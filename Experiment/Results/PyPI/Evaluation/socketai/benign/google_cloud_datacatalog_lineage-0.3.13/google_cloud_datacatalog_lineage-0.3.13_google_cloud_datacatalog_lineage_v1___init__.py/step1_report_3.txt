{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata, imports specific classes and types from the google.cloud.datacatalog_lineage_v1 library, and specifies what symbols to export.",
  "sources": "Import statements from google.cloud.datacatalog_lineage_v1, specifically gapic_version and various classes/types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or security issues are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code mainly imports and re-exports classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be standard SDK boilerplate for a client library.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK module that imports components from an external Google Cloud library and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard library setup code with no malicious intent or security concerns. It merely re-exports classes and constants from an official Google Cloud SDK module.",
