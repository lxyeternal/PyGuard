{
  "purpose": "This code defines imports and exports for a Python client library for Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage API, facilitating interaction with the API in an organized manner.",
  "sources": "Import statements for package version, modules, classes, and functions from google.cloud.datacatalog_lineage_v1 and relative local modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly loads classes and functions for API interaction.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is primarily module setup without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated code; only standard import and export definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, versioning, and __all__ declarations for module exports. It imports specific classes and functions from external libraries and local modules related to Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage API. There are no user inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling. The license comments are standard and do not pose security concerns. The code does not contain any logic that could be exploited or used maliciously. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward setup module for a client library.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module setup file with no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It simply organizes the public API of the package.",
