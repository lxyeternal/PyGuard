{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports classes, functions, and version information from the Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage SDK and defines an explicit public API via __all__, facilitating client library usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'google.cloud.datacatalog_lineage_v1' and local modules, including version info and class/function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static import and export setup without runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; static import/export pattern with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs; standard SDK boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes and version info from the Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage SDK and re-exports them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network operations, or data processing. The license header is standard, and the structure is typical for SDK setup modules. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The static nature and lack of runtime logic indicate a benign, standard setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate module for a Google Cloud client library, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.",
