{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and exposes classes, functions, and request/response types related to Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage API for use in a client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.datacatalog_lineage_v1 and relative local modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or user input processing observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines and exports classes and constants",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules from Google's Cloud Data Catalog Lineage library and defines a version and a list of exported classes and types for client use. It primarily serves as a library interface setup, with no runtime data processing, user input handling, or network activity. No signs of malicious logic, data leaks, or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign client library setup for Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage API, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
