  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step to assess the security implications of this code.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely for module setup: importing classes, defining `__all__`, and versioning.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or data leaks.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is standard SDK boilerplate, which is common in client libraries.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports do not identify any errors or logical flaws.\n   - The code structure is straightforward and consistent with typical Python SDK modules.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - Malware score is correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they rely on static analysis, which is appropriate here.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are zero for malware and security risk, and confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risk identified.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign module setup for a client library, with no security concerns.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
