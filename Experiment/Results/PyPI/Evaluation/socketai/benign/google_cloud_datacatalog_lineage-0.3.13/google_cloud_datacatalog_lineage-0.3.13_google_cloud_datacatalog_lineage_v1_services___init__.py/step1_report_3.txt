  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license and copyright notice, serving as metadata for a Python file.",
  "sources": "There are no functional code components that read input or data; only comments and licensing information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling functions are present, so untrusted data flows are absent.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow exists beyond the comments; hence, no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of licensing comments with no executable code, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is purely comments related to licensing and copyright, with no executable logic or data handling. There are no input sources, data flows, or sinks. The absence of code means no malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks are present. This is standard license header text, common in open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only licensing comments with no executable or malicious content. It presents no security risks or malicious behavior.",
