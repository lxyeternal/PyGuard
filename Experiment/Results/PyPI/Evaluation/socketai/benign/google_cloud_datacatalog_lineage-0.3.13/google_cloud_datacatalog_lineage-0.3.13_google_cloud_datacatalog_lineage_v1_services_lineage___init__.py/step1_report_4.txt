  "purpose": "Export module interfaces for LineageClient and LineageAsyncClient classes",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'async_client' and 'client'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports classes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard license and import statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and declares them in __all__ for export. It includes licensing and copyright notices, following standard practices. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no network or data transmission. It appears to be a typical package module setup without any malicious intent or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard Python module that exports certain classes for external use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
