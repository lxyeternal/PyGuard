{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing and exposing the classes 'LineageClient' and 'LineageAsyncClient' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and export only",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; purely static import/export",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with license comments and class exports",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module, likely an __init__.py, that imports two classes from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. It contains only license comments, import statements, and an __all__ declaration. There are no dynamic executions, network operations, data processing, or obfuscated patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. Confidence is high (1.0) due to the static and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
