{
  "purpose": "To expose and re-export classes for lineage client functionality, likely for use in a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.async_client and .client). No input reading from external sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling, output, or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; module only re-exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes from local modules and defining an __all__ list for exports. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The license header is standard. The code appears to be part of a package's public interface, with no indications of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module re-export without any malicious intent or security risks.",
