{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, responsible for reading version info, README content, discovering packages, and configuring package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'gapic_version.py', reads README.rst, and discovers packages via setuptools.find_namespace_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads and package configuration without external or dynamic inputs.",
  "flows": "Reads version and README files, discovers packages, and passes metadata to setuptools.setup() without any data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: extracting version info via regex, reading static files, discovering packages, and invoking setuptools.setup(). No dynamic execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. Dependencies are explicitly constrained, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. The regex for version extraction is standard and safe. Overall, the script is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
