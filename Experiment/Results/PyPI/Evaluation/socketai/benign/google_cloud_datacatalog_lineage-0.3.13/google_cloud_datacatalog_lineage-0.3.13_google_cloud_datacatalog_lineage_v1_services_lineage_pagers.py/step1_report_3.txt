  "purpose": "Define pagers and async pagers for iterating over responses from Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage API, including listing processes, runs, lineage events, and search links.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and types, initializes classes with request, response, and method parameters, reads response attributes and next page tokens.",
  "sinks": "Iterates over paginated responses and their fields; does not include untrusted input handling, external data storage, or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input request and response objects are passed into class instances; response attributes and next_page_token control iteration; no external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs present. The code appears to be standard SDK helper classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard pager classes for handling paginated API responses from Google Cloud services. It uses typical class structures, including __init__, __getattr__, __iter__, and __repr__, to facilitate iteration over response data. The asynchronous counterparts utilize async generators. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code relies on external method calls (passed as arguments) to retrieve data, consistent with SDK design. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate, auto-generated SDK helper classes for paginating API responses. It performs no malicious actions and contains no security risks within this context.",
