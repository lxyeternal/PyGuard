{
  "purpose": "Define pagers and async pagers for iterating through API responses related to data catalog lineage, processes, runs, lineage events, and links.",
  "sources": "Data is read from API response objects, initial request parameters, and potentially from method calls that fetch data.",
  "sinks": "Data is yielded to callers via iterators; no sinks involve executing untrusted data or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data from API responses flows through iterator methods to yield structured data objects; no external command execution or data leakage observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard API client paging mechanisms; no obfuscation or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements pagers for iterating through paginated API responses, both synchronously and asynchronously. It wraps API methods and response objects to facilitate iteration over process, run, lineage event, and link data. The use of response objects, method calls, and data yielding follows standard patterns for API response handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unsafe system operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard client library code for paginating through API responses. It contains no malicious logic, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is typical and aligns with common patterns for API response paging.",
