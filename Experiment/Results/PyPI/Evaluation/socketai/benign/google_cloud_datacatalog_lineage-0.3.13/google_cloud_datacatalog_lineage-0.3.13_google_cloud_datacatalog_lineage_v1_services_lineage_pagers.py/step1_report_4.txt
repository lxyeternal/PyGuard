{
  "purpose": "The code provides pagination utilities for iterating through API responses related to Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage, including list and search operations, both synchronously and asynchronously.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters for API requests (method, request objects, initial responses, metadata) during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code yields data from API responses, specifically various response fields such as 'processes', 'runs', 'lineage_events', 'links', and 'process_links'. It does not write or transmit untrusted data outside the defined methods.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (API request parameters) flow into class constructors; subsequent data flows through iterator methods yielding API response fields; response objects are used for attribute access and yielding data; no external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard pagination wrappers around API responses. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present. No dynamic execution or misleading variables detected. The code strictly follows typical pattern for paginated API responses.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for paginating through Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage API responses. It includes both sync and async variants, with standard pagination logic (using next_page_token). No code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic is evident. It does not handle sensitive information directly, nor does it execute external commands or write data outside of API response handling. All functionalities align with expected API pagination patterns, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, straightforward implementation of API response pagination helpers for Google Cloud Data Catalog Lineage responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and serves its intended purpose without any suspicious elements.",
