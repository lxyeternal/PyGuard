{
  "purpose": "Provides functions and classes for handling search results and pagination in Azure SDK, including token encoding/decoding and data extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads response objects, particularly 'response.next_page_parameters', 'response.next_link', 'response.facets', and 'response.results'. Uses input tokens in 'unpack_continuation_token'.",
  "sinks": "Base64 decoding/encoding in 'pack_continuation_token' and 'unpack_continuation_token', JSON parsing/serialization, and network request 'search_post' calls in '_get_next_cb'.",
  "flows": "Input token decoded to retrieve 'next_link' and 'next_page_request' -> 'search_post' call with 'next_page_request' -> response processed to extract facets and results -> tokens re-encoded in 'pack_continuation_token' -> returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation. Use of token encoding/decoding is standard for pagination. No malicious or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code manages search result pagination and token handling with base64 and JSON, which is standard practice. It performs network requests to 'search_post' with provided request objects. No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The flow from token decoding to API request and response processing is typical. No unusual or malicious code structures observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of pagination and data processing for an Azure search client. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It performs expected operations for search result handling.",
