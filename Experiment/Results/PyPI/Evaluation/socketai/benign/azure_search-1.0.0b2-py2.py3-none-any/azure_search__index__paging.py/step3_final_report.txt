{
  "purpose": "Handles pagination for Azure search results using continuation tokens encoded with base64 and JSON, manages search facets, and processes search responses.",
  "sources": "Reads search response objects, continuation tokens, and request models; uses response properties and serialization methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; processes data internally, encodes/decodes tokens, and performs network requests via SDK methods.",
  "flows": "Encodes response data into tokens (pack_continuation_token), decodes tokens to retrieve next page requests (unpack_continuation_token), and iterates over search results and facets.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard SDK practices are followed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard pagination handling for Azure SDK, with safe token serialization/deserialization, no suspicious network activity, and clear structure. No malicious or maliciously exploitable code is present. The use of base64 and JSON for tokens is common and secure in this context. Deserialization relies on SDK models, and network requests are typical SDK calls. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation for managing paginated search results within an Azure SDK. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate; however, given the absence of vulnerabilities, the security risk score could be conservatively lowered to 0.",
