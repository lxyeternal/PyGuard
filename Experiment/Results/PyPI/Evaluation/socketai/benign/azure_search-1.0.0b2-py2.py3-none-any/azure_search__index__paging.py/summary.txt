  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation for managing paginated search results within an Azure SDK. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate; however, given the absence of vulnerabilities, the security risk score could be conservatively lowered to 0."
