  "purpose": "A client to interact with an existing Azure search index, providing methods for searching, suggesting, autocomplete, and document management.",
  "sources": "Credentials (api-key), input parameters (endpoint, index_name, query, documents), environment variables (via credential object).",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Azure Search service, data retrieval, document uploads/deletions.",
  "flows": "Input credentials and parameters -> API calls to Azure service -> Response handling and data return.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK client for Azure Search, utilizing typical patterns for credential management, network communication, and data handling. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The credential handling relies on external secure storage, and no hardcoded secrets are found. The network interactions are standard API calls. The code structure is clear and well-documented, with no anomalies or unusual patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure Search SDK client with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal. The high confidence score (around 0.95) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.",
