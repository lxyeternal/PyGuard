  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward module that imports specific classes from a relative internal module and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code contains only a standard license header, import statements, and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No user input, network operations, dynamic code execution, or data handling is present.\n- The import path is relative, typical for internal package modules, not suspicious.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: it is a benign module setup for a Python SDK, likely related to Azure or Microsoft services.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is found.\n- The reports' scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no anomalies or suspicious claims are made.\n- The purpose and analysis are accurate; no further action needed.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign module that re-exports classes for a larger SDK. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- No changes necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, clear, and standard for a Python package's interface.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Work out the scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all evidence and analysis.",
