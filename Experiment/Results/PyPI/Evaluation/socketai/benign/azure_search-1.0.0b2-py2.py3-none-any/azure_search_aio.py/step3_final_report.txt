{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module export file, exposing specific classes from an internal package component for public use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports classes from a relative internal module ('._index.aio').",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is a standard module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module with a license header, importing two classes from an internal relative module, and exposing them via __all__. It contains no runtime logic, user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import path is typical for internal package modules. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export file with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
