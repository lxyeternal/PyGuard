  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string for a software package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static string assignment to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points that handle untrusted input or output are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns a static value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is very minimal, consisting only of a copyright notice, license comment, and a single version string assignment. No external input handling, no code execution, no sensitive data, and no suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a typical package metadata declaration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version indicator with no malicious or security-related issues. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
