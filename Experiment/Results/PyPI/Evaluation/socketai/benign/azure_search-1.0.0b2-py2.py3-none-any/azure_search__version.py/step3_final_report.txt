{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal package metadata declaration, specifically defining the version string for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments and a single variable assignment (VERSION = \"1.0.0b2\")",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or system effects",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is static with only a variable assignment and comments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single variable assignment indicating the package version. There are no functions, input/output operations, external calls, or data flows. The code is static and typical for package metadata. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign and metadata-only nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores reflect this accurately.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
