  "purpose": "Define the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink, as code contains only a constant assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only copyright and licensing comments with a version string; no suspicious or unusual code structures or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment block and a single variable assignment defining the package version. No external data input, no data processing, no potential sinks for untrusted data. The code does not contain any logic, functions, or executable statements that could pose security risks. It appears to be a minimal, benign header for a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving only as metadata. No malicious intent or security issues are present.",
