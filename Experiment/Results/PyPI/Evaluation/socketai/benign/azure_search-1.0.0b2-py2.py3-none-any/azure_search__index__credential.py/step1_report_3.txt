  "purpose": "Define a credential class for authenticating access to an Azure Search index using an API key.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameter 'api_key', method 'update_key' which sets '_api_key'.",
  "sinks": "The '_api_key' property is accessible via the 'api_key' property, which could be used to retrieve sensitive data.",
  "flows": "api_key is passed into the constructor, stored in '_api_key', and can be updated via 'update_key' method. The 'api_key' property exposes the stored key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code structures. The class provides methods to store and update API keys, but does not transmit or send data externally.",
  "analysis": "The class is a simple credential holder for API keys, with standard input validation and update capabilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code follows typical patterns for secure credential management within a library context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a credential class for API key management. There are no malicious activities or security risks present. It merely manages and exposes an API key variable, which is expected behavior.",
