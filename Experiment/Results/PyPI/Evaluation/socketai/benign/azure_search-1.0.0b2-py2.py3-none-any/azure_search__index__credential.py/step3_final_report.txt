  "purpose": "Credential class for managing an API key used for authenticating with Azure Search index.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameter 'api_key', and the 'update_key' method.",
  "sinks": "Stores the API key in the private attribute '_api_key', accessible via the 'api_key' property.",
  "flows": "Input via constructor or 'update_key' method flows into '_api_key', which can be retrieved via 'api_key' property.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward credential management. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type validation on 'api_key' during initialization, stores it securely in a private attribute, and allows updating via 'update_key'. The class provides access to the stored key through a property. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is simple, clear, and follows standard practices for credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard credential wrapper for an API key with no malicious intent or security issues. It manages sensitive data appropriately and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious behaviors. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified, considering the exposure of the API key in memory, but this is typical for credential classes.",
