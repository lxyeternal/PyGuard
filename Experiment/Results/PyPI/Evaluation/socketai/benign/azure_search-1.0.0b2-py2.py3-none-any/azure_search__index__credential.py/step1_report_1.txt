{
  "purpose": "Provides a credential class for authenticating with Azure Search using an API key.",
  "sources": "The constructor 'api_key' parameter, and the 'update_key' method which takes a new key.",
  "sinks": "The 'self._api_key' attribute that stores the API key and could be used in requests.",
  "flows": "The API key is set during initialization and can be updated via 'update_key', then retrieved via the 'api_key' property.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. The code straightforwardly manages an API key with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The class securely manages an API key for authentication purposes. It includes input validation for the key during initialization to ensure it's a string, which is standard. The API key can be updated after instantiation. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious operations. There are no hardcoded credentials aside from the variable name, and the implementation aligns with common credential management patterns. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard credential wrapper for an API key, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It simply manages the API key used for Azure Search authentication.",
