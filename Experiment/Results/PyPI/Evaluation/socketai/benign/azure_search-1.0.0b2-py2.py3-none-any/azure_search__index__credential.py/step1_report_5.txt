  "purpose": "Provides a credential class for authenticating with Azure Search using an API key.",
  "sources": "The API key input parameter in the constructor and the update_key method.",
  "sinks": "The api_key property and the update_key method, which store and potentially expose the API key.",
  "flows": "The API key is set during initialization and can be updated later via update_key; it is stored in a private variable and retrieved via a property.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. The code simply manages an API key string without hardcoding or leaking it. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The class stores an API key string provided during instantiation and allows updating it later. It validates the input type to be string, which is a standard practice. The key is stored privately and accessed via a property, with no visible leakage or external communication. No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, and no obfuscated or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a straightforward credential management class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard credential handler for Azure Search API keys with no signs of malicious behavior. It only manages a string API key with proper type validation and update capability. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
