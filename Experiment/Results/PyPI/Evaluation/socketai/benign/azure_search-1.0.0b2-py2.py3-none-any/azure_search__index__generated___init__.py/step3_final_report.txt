  "purpose": "A minimal, auto-generated Python module that imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__, serving as part of an SDK or client library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module '_search_index_client'. No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no external communication or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Static import flow from '_search_index_client' to module namespace; no dynamic data flow or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated SDK module with only static import statements and a comment. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution exists. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are present, and the code's purpose is clear and standard for SDK components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and standard for SDK modules. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
