  "purpose": "This code appears to be a generated Python module that imports a class named SearchIndexClient from a local module and exposes it for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module ._search_index_client when importing SearchIndexClient.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is being sent or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only imports a class and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, generated automatically, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated module that imports a class from a local module and makes it available via __all__. It contains comments indicating code generation origin and a warning about modifications. There are no dynamic or unsafe operations, no external data inputs, and no sensitive data handling. The structure and content are typical for auto-generated SDK code, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, auto-generated module for SDK purposes, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
