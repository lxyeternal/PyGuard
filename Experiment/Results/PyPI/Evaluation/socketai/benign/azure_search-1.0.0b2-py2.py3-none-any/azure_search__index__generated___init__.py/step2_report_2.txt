  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:\n   - The code is a minimal, auto-generated Python module that imports a class from a local module and defines an export list.\n   - All reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code does not handle user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n   - No anomalies, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n2. Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, auto-generated, and standard for SDK modules.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. Review the scores given to each issue:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - malware: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - securityRisk: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5:\n   - Since the code is straightforward, static, and auto-generated with no malicious intent, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n   - The current score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n5. Pay attention to the malware score:\n   - All reports assign malware: 0, which is correct.\n   - No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n6. Challenge any claims based on assumptions:\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's structure and comments.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious code are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n7. Ensure scores are consistent with the report:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and match the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at 0.\n- The confidence remains at 1, given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware         | 0                   | No malicious behavior or code present                        |\n| obfuscated      | 0                   | Code is clear, straightforward, not obfuscated              |\n| securityRisk    | 0                   | No security risks identified                                 |\n\nThis thorough review confirms that the code is safe and benign.",
