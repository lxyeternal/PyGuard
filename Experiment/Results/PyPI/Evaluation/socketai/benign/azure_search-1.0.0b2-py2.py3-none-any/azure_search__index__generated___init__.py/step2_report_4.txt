  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as auto-generated, minimal, consisting of a single import statement and an export list.\n- No signs of data flow, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code detected.\n- The code is standard for SDK or client library modules, with comments indicating auto-generation.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The code snippets are benign and do not contain any malware, backdoors, or security flaws.\n- The import statement is from a local module, which is typical for SDKs.\n- No data sinks, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is auto-generated, one might consider the possibility of malicious code being inserted during generation. However, there's no evidence of that here.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe, benign, and standard for SDK modules.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nNo further action needed. The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat.",
