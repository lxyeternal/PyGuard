{
  "purpose": "The code is part of a Python package, providing module imports and versioning information, intended for search index and query functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules _version and _index, which supply VERSION and various classes/objects related to search indexing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leakage are present; the code only imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs; the code is primarily module setup and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is standard for a well-documented package.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports version info and classes for search functionalities, then defines export variables. It contains licensing comments, import statements, and an __all__ declaration. No input reading, data processing, or untrusted data handling is present. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, standard module initialization for a Python SDK or package, with no malicious intent, no malicious code, and no security risks identified.",
