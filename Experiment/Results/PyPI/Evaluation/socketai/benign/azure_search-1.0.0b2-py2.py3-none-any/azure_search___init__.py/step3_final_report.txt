{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization script, importing version info and exposing internal classes/functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Reads version from internal module '_version' and imports classes/functions from internal module '_index'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; static import and export statements only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; standard boilerplate code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py or module setup script that imports version info and API components, then exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The code is static, straightforward, and follows standard patterns for Python package initialization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and contains no security or malicious concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
