  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code imports a version variable and various classes/functions from internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data output, network activity, or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or obfuscated code; standard boilerplate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward module initializer, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk:** 0 — no security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, the code only imports internal modules and defines `__all__`.  \n- No data processing, external input, or network activity.  \n- No anomalies or obfuscation.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: module imports, versioning, and API exposure.  \n- No dynamic code, input handling, or external interactions.  \n- No suspicious constructs.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with previous reports; purely import and export setup.  \n- No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above; standard package initialization pattern with no external inputs or suspicious code.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports describe code that is standard, static, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned in all reports (malware, obfuscated, risk) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities based on this code snippet; it is simply a package initialization file.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0, given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as the code is benign and contains no security risks.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a typical, safe package initializer with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should not be changed.",
