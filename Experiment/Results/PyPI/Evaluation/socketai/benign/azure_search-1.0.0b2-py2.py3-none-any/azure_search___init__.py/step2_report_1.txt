  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code imports a version variable and classes from internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows from untrusted sources; the code is static and purely for module setup.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code is standard boilerplate for package initialization.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; no security issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- Correctly notes no data handling or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same observations: straightforward import and export code, no dynamic behavior.\n- No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: standard package initializer, no suspicious activity.\n- No untrusted data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments.\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard module initialization script with no malicious or security-related concerns.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** None detected; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores Justification:** All malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are set to zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Potential Risks & Assumptions:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is static and non-executable beyond imports.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis code is a typical, benign package initialization script with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and does not warrant any security or malware alerts.",
