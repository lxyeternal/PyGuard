  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a typical Python package __init__.py or module initialization script.\n- It imports a version variable from a local module and several classes/functions from an internal module.\n- It defines __all__ to specify the public API.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, network connections, or data transformations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code is straightforward, serving as an API surface for a package.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as module metadata and imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or external data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No malicious or security risks.\n\n### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, consistent and accurate.\n- No issues identified.\n\n### Report 3\n- Correctly describes the code as a package initializer with no security concerns.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Report 4\n- Also consistent with previous assessments.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n### Report 5\n- Same conclusion: standard package __init__ pattern, no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as expected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or higher would be unwarranted given the lack of any security concern.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Note:** Since the code is a straightforward module initializer with no dynamic or external inputs, the scores assigned in the reports are justified.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. No adjustments needed.",
