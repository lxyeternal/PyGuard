{
  "purpose": "Define classes for constructing and managing search-related queries for an Azure Search index, including autocomplete, search, and suggestion queries.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to class constructors (__init__), and method parameters such as 'expression', 'fields'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of filter expressions, order_by, select properties on request objects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into request object properties via class methods (filter, order_by, select).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network or file operations, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes inheriting from a base class, utilizing type hints and property methods to manage request data. It uses standard Python class constructs, type annotations, and simple string manipulations. There are no network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code evaluations. The functions accept user input as strings but only assign these to request object properties without sanitization, which is typical in such query-building classes. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of query object classes for an Azure Search client. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no obfuscated code. It appears safe and intended solely for building query requests.",
