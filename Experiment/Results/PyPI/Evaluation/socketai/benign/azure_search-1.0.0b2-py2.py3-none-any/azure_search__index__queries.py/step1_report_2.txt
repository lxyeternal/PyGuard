{
  "purpose": "Define classes for constructing and manipulating search queries for Azure Search index, including autocomplete, search, and suggest functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data originates from method parameters such as 'expression', 'fields', and keyword arguments passed to class constructors.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the assignment of user-provided 'expression' to 'self._request.filter' and joining fields for 'order_by' and 'select'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters (user input) into class attributes and request objects; specifically, 'expression' from filter() method flows into request.filter, 'fields' into order_by() and select().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present. The code mainly constructs request objects without executing external commands or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes inheriting from a base query class, initializing request objects based on type hints, and providing methods to set query parameters. The filter() method assigns a string to request.filter, which is typical for query filtering. The order_by() and select() methods concatenate user-supplied fields and assign them to request properties, raising errors if no fields are provided. All operations are standard for search query construction, with no signs of malicious behavior or data leakage. No external system interactions or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward and focused on constructing search queries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for constructing search queries with no malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or security risks identified. It is designed for legitimate query building in Azure Search contexts.",
