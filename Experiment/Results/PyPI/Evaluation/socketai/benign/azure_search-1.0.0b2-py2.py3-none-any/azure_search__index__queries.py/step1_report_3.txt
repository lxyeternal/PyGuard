{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for constructing and managing search queries (autocomplete, search, suggest) for an Azure Search index, encapsulating request parameters and query customization methods.",
  "sources": "Data sources include the input arguments to class constructors and methods such as filter(), order_by(), and select(). These inputs are used to set attributes on request objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the assignments to self._request.filter, self._request.order_by, and self._request.select, which may influence the request parameters sent to the Azure service.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs (e.g., expression, fields) through class methods (filter(), order_by(), select()) into request object attributes, which are then used for query execution.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The code appears straightforward and standard for a query builder pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class _QueryBase and subclasses for specific query types, encapsulating request creation and customization. Input validation is minimal but appropriate, raising exceptions when necessary (e.g., no fields provided in order_by or select). All interactions are within the context of building query parameters for Azure Search, with no indications of malicious behavior or data leakage. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present; the code appears to be a typical query builder module.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a safe, standard query abstraction layer for Azure Search, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle untrusted external data beyond basic parameter setting, and there are no obfuscated or malicious behaviors detected.",
