  "purpose": "Define query classes for different Azure Search index operations (autocomplete, search, suggest).",
  "sources": "Initialization of request objects, setting filters, ordering, selecting fields.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to request object attributes (filter, order_by, select).",
  "flows": "Input parameters to request object attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses standard Python practices and class structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for creating different query types for Azure Search services, initializing request objects, and providing methods to modify query parameters. No data is read from untrusted sources or user input beyond method parameters, which are used to set object attributes. There is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious intent. All operations are straightforward and serve to configure query parameters. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of query-building classes for Azure Search. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
