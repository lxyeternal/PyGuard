{
  "purpose": "Define classes for constructing different types of search queries for Azure Search service, including autocomplete, search, and suggest queries.",
  "sources": "Initialization of request objects via class constructors; setting request filters and properties through methods.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of filter expressions and query parameters to request objects; these could potentially incorporate untrusted input if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Input data (filter expressions, ordering, select fields) from method parameters flow into request object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of type annotations and dynamic request class selection is standard. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines query classes for Azure Search operations with methods to set filters and ordering. The classes instantiate request objects based on provided keyword arguments. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of type hints and class structure appears conventional. No anomalies or suspicious patterns found. Overall, the code appears to be standard SDK code facilitating search queries without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical SDK module for constructing Azure Search queries. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It is safe and has no security risks beyond normal usage of such SDK classes.",
