{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for constructing search query requests for Azure Search, including autocomplete, search, and suggest functionalities.",
  "sources": "Assignment of user-provided strings (filter, order_by, select) directly to request object properties.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or system effects; simple property assignments.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from method arguments to request object properties without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SDK query classes, with no network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. User inputs are assigned directly to request properties, which is typical in SDK design; validation likely occurs elsewhere. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very low) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK component for building search queries. No malicious or security issues are present. The current scores are appropriate; minor risk scores could be lowered to zero for precision, but their current values are acceptable given the context.",
