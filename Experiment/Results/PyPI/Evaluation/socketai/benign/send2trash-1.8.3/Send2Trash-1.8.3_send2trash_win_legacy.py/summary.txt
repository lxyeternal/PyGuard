  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Windows file deletion utility that safely moves files to the Recycle Bin. It performs as intended without malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the destructive nature of file deletion, but this is inherent to its function. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, which is appropriate."
