  "purpose": "Provides a Windows utility to delete files by moving them to the Recycle Bin using Windows API calls, handling path normalization and error mapping.",
  "sources": "Path inputs from user or calling functions, including file paths requiring deletion.",
  "sinks": "Windows API function SHFileOperationW which performs file deletion/move to Recycle Bin.",
  "flows": "Input paths -> path preprocessing and conversion -> API call via SHFileOperationW -> potential error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward use of Windows API for file deletion.",
  "analysis": "The code interfaces with Windows API to delete files safely, handling long and UNC paths, converting to short paths to avoid length issues, and mapping error codes. It does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic. Error handling is appropriate, and the purpose aligns with standard file deletion utilities. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Windows file deletion utility that safely moves files to the Recycle Bin. It performs as intended without malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the destructive nature of file deletion, but this is inherent to its function. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, which is appropriate.",
