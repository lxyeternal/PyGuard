{
  "purpose": "The function 'send2trash' moves specified file paths to the system trash/recycle bin.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'paths' which is processed by 'preprocess_paths' to generate file paths.",
  "targets": "The 'Gio.File.new_for_path' and 'f.trash' methods are used to perform the trash operation on each path.",
  "flows": "Paths from 'preprocess_paths' -> 'Gio.File.new_for_path' -> 'f.trash', with error handling potentially raising exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a list of file paths, preprocesses them, and attempts to move each to the trash using Gio library functions. Error handling is implemented for specific Gio errors, raising a custom exception or a general OSError. The code appears straightforward and relies on standard libraries. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as intended for safe trash operations with proper error handling. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The code appears benign and standard for this functionality.",
