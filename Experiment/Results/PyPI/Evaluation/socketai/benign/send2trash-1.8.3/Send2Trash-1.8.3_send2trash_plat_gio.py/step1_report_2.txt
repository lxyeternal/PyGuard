  "purpose": "To move files or directories to the trash/recycle bin.",
  "sources": "Function parameter 'paths' passed into 'send2trash', which is processed by 'preprocess_paths'.",
  "sinks": "Gio.File.new_for_path and f.trash methods that perform file system operations to delete files.",
  "flows": "Input 'paths' -> 'preprocess_paths' -> Gio.File.new_for_path -> f.trash, with error handling potentially raising exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of exception handling is standard for file operations. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'send2trash' that takes a list of paths, preprocesses them, and attempts to move each to the trash using Gio.File's trash method. It handles specific GObject.GError exceptions, raising custom or OS errors as appropriate. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The code appears to implement standard file trashing behavior, with proper error handling for unsupported operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate file system operation to move files to trash, with appropriate error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and aligns with typical file management practices.",
