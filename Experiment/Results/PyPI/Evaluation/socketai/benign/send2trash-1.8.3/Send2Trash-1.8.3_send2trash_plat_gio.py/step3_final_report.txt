  "purpose": "Move specified files or directories to trash using Gio.File's trash method, with path preprocessing and error handling.",
  "sources": "Paths provided as input to the send2trash function, processed by preprocess_paths.",
  "sinks": "Gio.File.new_for_path and f.trash() methods that perform filesystem operations.",
  "flows": "Input paths -> preprocess_paths -> Gio.File.new_for_path -> f.trash() -> filesystem trash operation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; exception handling is standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward trash operation on provided paths, with proper error handling for Gio errors. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The exception handling manages unsupported operations gracefully. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard filesystem trash operations with appropriate error handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, confirming the code's safety.",
