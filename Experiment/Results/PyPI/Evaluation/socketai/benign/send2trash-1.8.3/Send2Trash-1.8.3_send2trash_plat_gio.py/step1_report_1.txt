{
  "purpose": "To move specified file paths to the trash using Gio.File's trash method, with path preprocessing.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'paths' which is processed by preprocess_paths.",
  "sinks": "Gio.File.new_for_path and f.trash are used to perform the trash operation; exceptions are caught and re-raised.",
  "flows": "Input 'paths' -> preprocess_paths -> Gio.File.new_for_path -> f.trash; errors from trash may trigger exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or malicious code detected. The code handles exceptions specifically related to trash support.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for filesystem operations and exception handling, then defines a function 'send2trash'. It preprocesses input paths and iterates over them, creating Gio.File objects and invoking trash. Exception handling captures specific Gio errors, raising custom or OS errors accordingly. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to perform legitimate trash operations with proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a straightforward and legitimate file trashing operation with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It manages exceptions correctly and operates within expected boundaries.",
