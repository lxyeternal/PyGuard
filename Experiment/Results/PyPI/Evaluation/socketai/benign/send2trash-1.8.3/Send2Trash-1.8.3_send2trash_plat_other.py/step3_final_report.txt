  "purpose": "Provides a safe, standards-compliant trash management utility following freedesktop.org specifications, handling filesystem operations, permissions, and external volumes without malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads such as os.path.exists, os.access, os.lstat, and user environment variables; input paths from user or calling functions.",
  "sinks": "File and directory creation/modification (os.makedirs, open for writing info files), renaming/moving files (os.rename, shutil.move), and writing trash info files.",
  "flows": "Input paths are validated for existence and permissions, then moved or renamed into trash directories, with metadata written to info files, following volume and device boundary checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Path handling is standard; no unusual dynamic code execution or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a filesystem-based trash system with proper permission checks, device boundary validation, and volume-specific trash directories. It performs standard operations like creating directories, writing metadata, and moving files, with safeguards against cross-device issues. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to established standards, indicating a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard trash management utility with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified. It is safe for use in production environments.",
