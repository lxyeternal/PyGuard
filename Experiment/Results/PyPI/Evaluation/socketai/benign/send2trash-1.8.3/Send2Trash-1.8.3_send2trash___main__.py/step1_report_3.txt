{
  "purpose": "A command-line tool to send specified files to the system trash/recycle bin",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments 'files' (list of filenames provided by user), and potentially 'verbose' flag",
  "sinks": "send2trash function (which interacts with the OS to delete files), print statements, sys.stderr output",
  "flows": "User provides filenames -> send2trash is called with filenames -> files are moved to trash; optional verbose print -> error messages on failure",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code behaviors. Usage of send2trash is standard for file deletion to trash.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts filenames as command-line arguments, then calls send2trash on each filename, which safely moves files to the OS trash. The script includes verbose output option. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code performs standard file deletion to trash with proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate file management utility intended to safely move files to trash. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It operates as a typical file deletion utility with no suspicious behaviors.",
