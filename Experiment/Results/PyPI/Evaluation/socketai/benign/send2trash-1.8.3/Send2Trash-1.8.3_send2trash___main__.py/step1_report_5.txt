  "purpose": "A command-line tool to send specified files to the trash/recycle bin",
  "sources": "User input files specified via command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "send2trash function which moves files to trash, print statements for verbose output, sys.exit on error",
  "flows": "User specifies files -> send2trash called with each filename -> optional verbose print -> error handling with print and exit",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no unusual behavior, no obfuscation, and no malicious logic present",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries and a third-party module 'send2trash' to safely move files to trash. It accepts filenames via command-line arguments, optionally prints verbose messages, and handles errors gracefully. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity or data leaks. The presence of a copyright and license note indicates proper licensing. No anomalies or malicious code were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for file management, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows best practices for error handling and user interaction.",
