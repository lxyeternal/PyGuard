  "purpose": "A command-line tool to send specified files to the system trash/recycle bin.",
  "sources": "User-supplied filenames via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "send2trash function which deletes files by moving them to trash, and print statements.",
  "flows": "User inputs filenames -> send2trash called with filenames -> optional verbose print of filenames.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts filenames as command-line arguments, then uses the send2trash library to delete those files by moving them to trash. It provides optional verbose output. The code includes error handling for OSError during file deletion. No suspicious code or malicious behavior observed. The code simply wraps an existing library for file deletion with command-line interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for deleting files safely via the trash mechanism. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
