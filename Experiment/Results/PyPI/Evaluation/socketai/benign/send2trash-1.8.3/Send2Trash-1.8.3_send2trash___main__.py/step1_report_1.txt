  "purpose": "A command-line tool to send specified files to the trash/recycle bin.",
  "sources": "User provides file paths via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The send2trash function, which deletes/moves files to trash; also print and stderr output.",
  "flows": "User input (file names) -> send2trash function -> trash; optional verbose print -> stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. Usage appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments to accept file paths and an optional verbose flag. It uses send2trash to move files to the system trash, handling errors with exception handling and outputting errors to stderr. No external data sources or untrusted input processing beyond standard argument parsing. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior identified. The functionality is limited to safe file deletion to trash.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for deleting files to trash with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears well-structured and straightforward.",
