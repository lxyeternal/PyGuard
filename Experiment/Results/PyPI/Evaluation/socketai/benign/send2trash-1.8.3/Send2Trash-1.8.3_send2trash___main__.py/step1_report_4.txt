It accepts filenames via command-line arguments, optionally prints verbose messages, and handles exceptions gracefully. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The functionality aligns with a legitimate file management utility. The code appears well-structured, minimal, and free of suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for sending files to trash. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The usage of 'send2trash' is appropriate and safe.",
