  "purpose": "A command-line utility to send specified files to the system trash using the send2trash library.",
  "sources": "The filenames provided as command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The send2trash function which moves files to trash; potential data loss if misused.",
  "flows": "Input filenames -> send2trash function -> files moved to trash.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of a reputable library; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, clear script that parses command-line arguments, optionally prints verbose output, and moves files to trash with error handling. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The use of send2trash is appropriate and safe. Error handling is standard, and the code's purpose is benign. No suspicious behaviors or malicious intent are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1) are consistent with the code's functionality, though the risk score could be lowered to 0 given the benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility for deleting files to trash. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate, and the code can be considered secure and benign.",
