  "purpose": "Define compatibility and environment setup for handling string and environment variables across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys and environment variables from os.environ or os.environb.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ or os.environb.",
  "flows": "Code reads Python version -> sets text_type, binary_type, environb based on environment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; use of os.supports_bytes_environ is conditional and appears standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up compatibility for string types and environment variable access depending on Python version. It conditionally assigns 'environb' based on OS support and Python version. No external input, data leakage, or malicious code present. It appears to be standard environment and version compatibility boilerplate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, intended for cross-version compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
