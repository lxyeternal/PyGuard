  "purpose": "Define compatibility variables for Python 2 and 3, including environment variable handling.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, os.environ, os.environb",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as environment variables are only read, not written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily sets up compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "The line 'if os.supports_bytes_environ' is problematic because 'supports_bytes_environ' is not a documented or standard attribute of 'os'. This may indicate misuse or an attempt to check for environment variable handling capabilities. Otherwise, no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to set text and binary type variables, and attempts to conditionally set 'environb' based on a non-standard 'supports_bytes_environ' attribute, which is not part of the standard 'os' module API. It imports 'Iterable' from either 'collections.abc' or 'collections' for compatibility. The code is straightforward, primarily establishing compatibility and environment variable handling without any data processing or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility setup with an anomalous attribute check that is likely incorrect or outdated. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
