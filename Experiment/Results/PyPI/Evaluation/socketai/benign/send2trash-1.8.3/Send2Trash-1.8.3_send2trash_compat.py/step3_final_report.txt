  "purpose": "Compatibility boilerplate for Python 2 and 3, handling string types and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ or os.environb; checking Python version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily setup code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.supports_bytes_environ, which is not a standard attribute of the os module in Python.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine environment variable support and string types across Python versions. The key anomaly is referencing os.supports_bytes_environ, which does not exist in the standard library, leading to potential AttributeError at runtime unless the environment has been patched. No malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and primarily compatibility boilerplate. The anomaly suggests possible misconfiguration, custom extension, or tampering. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear. The security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the potential for runtime errors due to the non-standard attribute, but not indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility boilerplate with an anomalous reference to a non-standard os attribute. It does not exhibit malicious behavior but could cause runtime errors if the attribute is missing. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the main concern is verifying the environment or correcting the attribute usage to ensure stability.",
