  "purpose": "Define Python version compatibility and environment variable handling.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, os.supports_bytes_environ, os.environb, os.environ",
  "sinks": "None directly, but environment variables are set up for potential use elsewhere",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read into environb (if available) or os.environ",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.supports_bytes_environ without a check for its existence could cause errors; the code is mostly benign, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up compatibility variables based on Python version. It attempts to use os.supports_bytes_environ, which may not exist in all environments, potentially leading to an AttributeError. The environment variable handling appears standard, without any suspicious or malicious operations. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious actions are evident. The license comments are informational. The code is straightforward and mainly concerned with compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment performs environment and version compatibility setup with no signs of malicious intent. It is benign and typical for cross-version Python scripts.",
