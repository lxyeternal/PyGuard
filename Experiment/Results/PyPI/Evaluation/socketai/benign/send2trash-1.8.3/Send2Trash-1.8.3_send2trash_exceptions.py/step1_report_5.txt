{
  "purpose": "Define a custom permission error class for handling permission-related issues specific to trash directory operations in a cross-version Python environment.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'errno' and 'send2trash.compat', class constructor receiving 'filename' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The constructor raises a permission error with a message and filename, but this is a controlled exception for handling permission issues.",
  "flows": "The code sets a class based on Python version, then the custom class raises an error related to file permissions when instantiated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system error codes and version compatibility utilities, then defines a custom exception class that extends a permission error tailored for trash directory permissions. It conditionally assigns the error class based on Python version. The custom exception is designed to encapsulate permission-denied errors specific to trash operations, providing context-specific messaging. The class constructor simply calls the parent constructor with an error number, message, and filename. There are no dynamic code executions, data exfiltration, or malicious activities present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a custom exception class for permission errors in trash operations. It is intended for use within a larger file management library and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
