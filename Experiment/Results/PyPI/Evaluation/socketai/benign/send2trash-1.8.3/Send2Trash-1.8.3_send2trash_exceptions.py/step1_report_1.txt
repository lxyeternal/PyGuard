  "purpose": "Define a custom permission error class for handling permission issues specific to trash operations in the send2trash package.",
  "sources": "Importing errno; checking PY3; setting _permission_error; class constructor receiving filename.",
  "sinks": "Initialization of the TrashPermissionError with a filename; potential display or logging of filename upon error.",
  "flows": "Code imports errno and PY3; sets _permission_error; defines TrashPermissionError class; initializes with filename.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard error handling and class definition. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and compatibility layer, then sets an error class based on Python version. It defines a subclass for permission errors related to trash operations, with a constructor that calls the parent constructor with specific error code and message. No untrusted input handling, external network activity, or obfuscation is present. The purpose appears to be straightforward error handling. No anomalies or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a specific error class for trash permission issues, with clear and standard logic. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
