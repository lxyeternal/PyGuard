{
  "purpose": "Define a custom permission error class for handling permission issues related to trashing files.",
  "sources": "Importing errno, PY3, and handling the PermissionError/OSError distinction; using filename parameter in constructor.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, no output, no external network or data transfer.",
  "flows": "Initialization of _permission_error based on PY3; instantiation of TrashPermissionError with filename, which calls the parent constructor with error code and message.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard class inheritance and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines an exception class to represent permission errors when dealing with trash files. It conditionally assigns _permission_error to either PermissionError (Python 3) or OSError (Python 2), which is standard practice for compatibility. The custom class TrashPermissionError extends the appropriate exception, providing specific messaging for permission issues. There are no sources of untrusted input, no external network calls, no data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a file management library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a custom error class for permission errors. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate utility class for handling specific filesystem permission issues.",
