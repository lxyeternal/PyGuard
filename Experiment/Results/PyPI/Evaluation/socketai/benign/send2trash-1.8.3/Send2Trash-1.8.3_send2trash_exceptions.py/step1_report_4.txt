  "purpose": "Define a custom permission error class for trash directory operations, providing a more specific exception for permission issues during file trashing.",
  "sources": "Importing errno, importing PY3 from send2trash.compat, usage of PermissionError / OSError, the constructor of TrashPermissionError",
  "sinks": "Raising a PermissionError / OSError with specific errno and message",
  "flows": "Initialization of TrashPermissionError with filename -> raises permission error with specific errno and message",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports system error codes and a compatibility flag, then conditionally assigns a permission error class based on Python version. It defines a custom exception class that inherits from the permission error class, adding contextual information. The class is intended to be used when permission issues occur during trash operations, providing a specific exception type. The code appears straightforward and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class for permission errors related to trash operations. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this code segment.",
