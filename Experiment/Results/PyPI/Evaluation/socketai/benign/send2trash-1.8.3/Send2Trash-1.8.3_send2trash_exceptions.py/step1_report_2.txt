  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for permission errors related to trash directory operations in the send2trash library.",
  "sources": "Import of errno, conditional assignment of PermissionError or OSError, and class definition using these exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of TrashPermissionError with filename parameter, which raises the underlying permission error.",
  "flows": "Creation of TrashPermissionError object -> calling _permission_error.__init__ with filename -> raising permission error.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code implements standard exception handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally assigns a permission error exception based on Python version, then defines a custom exception class for permission errors specific to trash directory operations. The class constructor calls the base exception's init with an error code, message, and filename. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be straightforward exception handling meant for proper error reporting in a trash management context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class for permission errors in trash management. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It serves as part of a normal library handling permission-related errors.",
