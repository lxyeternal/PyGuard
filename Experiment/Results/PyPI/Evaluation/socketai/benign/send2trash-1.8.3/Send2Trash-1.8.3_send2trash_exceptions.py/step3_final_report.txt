{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class TrashPermissionError for permission errors during trash operations, providing compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "The class constructor uses errno.EACCES and filename parameters; imports errno and PY3 for version detection.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code only raises an exception with a filename.",
  "flows": "Constructor receives filename, passes it to parent class along with error code and message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally assigns a base exception class based on Python version, then defines a specific error class for permission issues. It uses standard Python practices without external data, network activity, or obfuscation. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are present. The purpose is to improve error handling clarity for trash permission errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility class for handling permission errors in trash operations. It contains no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, accurately reflecting its safe, utility nature.",
