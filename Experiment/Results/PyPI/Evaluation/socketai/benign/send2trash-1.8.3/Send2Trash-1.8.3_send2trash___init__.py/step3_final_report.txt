{
  "purpose": "Cross-platform import of the send2trash function based on the operating system, with fallbacks for different environments.",
  "sources": "sys.platform check, import statements from platform-specific modules, try-except block for fallback modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only module imports based on system info",
  "flows": "sys.platform determines which send2trash module is imported; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward platform detection and fallback imports",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system via sys.platform and imports the corresponding send2trash implementation. It includes a fallback mechanism using try-except to import from alternative modules if the primary import fails. The code does not execute any dangerous actions, does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, and relies on standard practices for cross-platform compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The import pattern is common and safe, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cross-platform import pattern for trash deletion functions. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
