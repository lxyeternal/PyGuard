  "purpose": "Determine the platform-specific implementation of the send2trash function for deleting files safely across different operating systems.",
  "sources": "sys.platform, import statements for platform-specific modules",
  "sinks": "The imported send2trash function may be called elsewhere in the code, potentially deleting files.",
  "flows": "sys.platform determines which send2trash module is imported; later usage of send2trash invokes the platform-specific implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, and no unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code identifies the operating system platform and imports a platform-specific implementation of the send2trash function accordingly. It uses standard Python imports and exception handling for fallback options. The logic appears straightforward and intended for safe file deletion. No embedded malicious code or backdoors are present. The import fallback to a local module suggests a design for robustness, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a platform-specific loader for the send2trash function with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It simply ensures compatibility across platforms. No security risks or malware are present.",
