  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs platform detection and imports the appropriate `send2trash` module accordingly.\n- The code uses standard practices: `sys.platform` checks, try-except for fallback imports, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The purpose is to ensure cross-platform compatibility for trash deletion, which is a common pattern.\n- The reports' confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No suspicious or unusual import patterns.\n- No dynamic code execution.\n- No evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n- The fallback mechanisms are standard and intended for robustness, not malicious purposes.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware score: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score: All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk: All assign 0, justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard cross-platform import pattern with no security issues or malware.\n\n---\n\n### My assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is safe, well-structured, and serves a legitimate purpose without any signs of malicious behavior.",
