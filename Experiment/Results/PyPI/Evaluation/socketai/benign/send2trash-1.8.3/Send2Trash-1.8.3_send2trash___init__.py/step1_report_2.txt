  "purpose": "Selects and imports the appropriate 'send2trash' module based on the operating system.",
  "sources": "sys.platform to determine OS; import statements for platform-specific modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leakage points, no system modifications or network operations.",
  "flows": "sys.platform value → conditional import of platform-specific modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports platform-specific modules for trash handling based on sys.platform. It uses try-except to fallback if certain modules are unavailable, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or code paths, and no network or system modification activities observed. The logic is straightforward and intended for cross-platform compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs platform-based module imports for trash management without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard implementation with no security concerns identified.",
