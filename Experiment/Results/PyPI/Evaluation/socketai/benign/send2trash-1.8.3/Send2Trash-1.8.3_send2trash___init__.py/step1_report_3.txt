  "sources": "sys.platform, import statements for platform-specific modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; dynamic imports based on platform conditions",
  "flows": "sys.platform check -> import platform-specific send2trash implementation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard platform detection and conditional imports; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system using sys.platform and imports the appropriate send2trash function for macOS, Windows, or other systems. It attempts to use gio on non-Windows, non-macOS systems and falls back to a local implementation if gio is unavailable. All imports are conditional and based on platform detection. No untrusted input, no suspicious code, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are present. The licensing comments and import logic are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cross-platform import pattern for trashing files, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
