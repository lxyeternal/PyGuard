{
  "purpose": "The code selects and imports a platform-specific function 'send2trash' for deleting files safely, based on the operating system.",
  "sources": "Reads system platform information via sys.platform; attempts to import platform-specific modules for send2trash.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only imports functions and does not execute any potentially dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "sys.platform is checked to determine platform-specific imports; fallback to alternative modules if initial imports fail.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; the imports are standard and conditional based on platform.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports platform-specific modules for trash deletion, with a fallback mechanism. It only performs imports based on system information and handles import errors gracefully. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, platform-aware import pattern for a trash deletion utility, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
