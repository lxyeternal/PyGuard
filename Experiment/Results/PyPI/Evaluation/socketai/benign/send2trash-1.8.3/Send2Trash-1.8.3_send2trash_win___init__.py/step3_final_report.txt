  "purpose": "Detects Windows OS version and conditionally imports modules for trash operations based on OS version and module availability.",
  "sources": "platform.version() for OS version; import statements for send2trash modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data leaks; only module imports and version checks",
  "flows": "Version parsing from platform.version() leading to conditional imports",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version check and fallback import logic",
  "analysis": "The code performs a Windows version check using platform.version(), parses the major version, and conditionally imports the appropriate send2trash module depending on OS version and import success. No untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious or suspicious behavior are present. The logic is simple, transparent, and intended for compatibility. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility pattern for Windows environment detection and module import. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
