  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, logic, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's intent: determine Windows version and import appropriate modules.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No issues. The code performs a straightforward version check and conditional import. No untrusted data, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that the code is a compatibility check with fallback mechanisms, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as previous; the code is a straightforward environment detection and import mechanism.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Again, the code is a standard environment check with conditional imports, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Slightly less confident (confidence=0.9), but still consistent. The code performs a straightforward version check and import, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (or less). The report states risk=0, which is reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or security issues. The only minor point is that the code relies on version parsing, but this is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly lower confidence is acceptable, but overall, the assessment remains correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign environment detection and conditional imports.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero in all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None, as the code only performs version checks and imports.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the consistent benign nature, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there's no security risk.\n\n**Note:** The code is a typical compatibility pattern, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
