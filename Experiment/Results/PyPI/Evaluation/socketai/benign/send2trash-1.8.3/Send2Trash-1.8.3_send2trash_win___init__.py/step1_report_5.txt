{
  "purpose": "The code determines the Windows OS version and imports a suitable module for sending files to trash, depending on the OS version and available libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads OS version via platform.version() and attempts to import modules 'send2trash.win.modern.send2trash' or 'send2trash.win.legacy.send2trash'.",
  "sinks": "The imports load modules that handle file deletion operations; no untrusted data flows into sensitive functions within this snippet.",
  "flows": "OS version check → conditional import → fallback import if necessary.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on OS version parsing and dynamic imports but does not contain suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with version detection to decide between modern or legacy file trashing methods. It uses a try-except block to attempt importing a module, providing fallback behavior. The logic appears straightforward and intended for compatibility. No obfuscated code, malicious activity, or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility check for OS version and library availability to handle file deletion. No malicious intent or security issues identified.",
