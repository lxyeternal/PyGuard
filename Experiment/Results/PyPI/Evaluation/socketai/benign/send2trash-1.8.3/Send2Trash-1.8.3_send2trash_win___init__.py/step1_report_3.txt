  "purpose": "Determine the appropriate method for sending files to the trash on Windows systems based on OS version and available libraries.",
  "sources": "platform.version() to check OS version, import statements for send2trash modules",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only imports modules based on conditions",
  "flows": "platform.version() -> condition check -> import send2trash modules based on OS version and availability",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed",
  "analysis": "The code assesses the Windows OS version via platform.version() and attempts to import the appropriate send2trash module depending on OS version and library availability. It uses try-except to fallback if pywin32 is not available. The logic is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. All operations are standard import statements conditioned on OS version and module availability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign platform-specific module selector for trash file operations. It contains no malware or malicious intent. It performs environment detection and module import, with fallback mechanisms, typical for cross-version Windows support.",
