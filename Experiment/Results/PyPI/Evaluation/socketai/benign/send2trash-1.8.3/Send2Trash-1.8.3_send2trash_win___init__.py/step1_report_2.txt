{
  "purpose": "Determine whether the code selects appropriate modules for file deletion operations based on the Windows version, with fallback mechanisms.",
  "sources": "version() function from platform module, import statements from send2trash.win.modern and send2trash.win.legacy",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed; only import and conditional logic for module selection",
  "flows": "version() output influences which module (modern or legacy send2trash) is imported",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version check and conditional imports",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Windows version and conditionally imports modules for file deletion. It tries to use a modern API if available and falls back to an older method if necessary. The import logic is based solely on the Windows version and ImportError handling, with no signs of suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual constructs are present. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a file deletion utility, adapting to system capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for system compatibility. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. It performs version-based conditional imports for file deletion functions, which is a common pattern for compatibility handling.",
