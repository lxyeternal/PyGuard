{
  "purpose": "Selects appropriate send2trash implementation based on Windows version and availability of pywin32.",
  "sources": "Reads platform.version() to determine Windows version; attempts to import modules send2trash.win.modern.send2trash or send2trash.win.legacy.send2trash",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data; import statements are used for module loading",
  "flows": "platform.version() → conditional logic → import send2trash modules",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version check and conditional import",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing platform.version() and parsing the Windows version number. It then conditionally imports modules based on Windows version and module availability. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are involved. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior is present. The imports are used to select different implementations depending on environment conditions, which is standard practice.\n\nThe code does not contain hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. It simply performs environment detection and module imports.\n\nOverall, the logic appears benign and typical for cross-version compatibility handling in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward environment check and import mechanism to select the appropriate send2trash implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
