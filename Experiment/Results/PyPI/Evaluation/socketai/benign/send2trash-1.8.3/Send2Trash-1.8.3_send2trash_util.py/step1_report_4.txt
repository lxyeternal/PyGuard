  "purpose": "Preprocesses a list of file paths, ensuring they are in a list format and converting pathlib paths to strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'paths' which can be any iterable, string, or pathlib object.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any data sinks that lead to potential data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input 'paths' is checked and converted into a list; if elements are pathlib paths, they are converted to strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The function checks the type of 'paths' and converts it into a list if necessary. It handles iterable types excluding strings and bytes, and also converts pathlib.Path objects to string paths. There are no external calls or network interactions, and no suspicious or malicious code behavior. It is a standard utility function for path normalization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility function with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs safe type checking and conversion of file paths. The overall security risk is minimal.",
