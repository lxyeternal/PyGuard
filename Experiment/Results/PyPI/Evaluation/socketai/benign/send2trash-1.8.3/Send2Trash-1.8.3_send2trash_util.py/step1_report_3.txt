  "purpose": "Preprocess a list of file paths, converting iterable inputs to a list of path strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'paths' which can be a string, list, or iterable type",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or outputting external data",
  "flows": "Input 'paths' -> type check and conversion -> list of path strings",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code correctly handles various path input types. No malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The function 'preprocess_paths' accepts 'paths' which can be a string, iterable, or other object. It checks if 'paths' is an iterable but not a string or binary type, converting it to a list if so. If 'paths' is not a list, it wraps it into a list. Then, it converts any path-like objects (with __fspath__ method) to string paths. There are no network calls, data leaks, or malicious behavior present. The code appears to be standard utility for path handling with proper type checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility function for path preprocessing, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It handles inputs appropriately for its purpose.",
