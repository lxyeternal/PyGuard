  "purpose": "Utility function to preprocess a list of file paths, ensuring they are in list form and converting path-like objects to strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'paths' received from external callers; potentially any object passed to 'preprocess_paths'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or send data externally; no sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'paths' → type checking and conversion → optional conversion of path-like objects to strings → return processed list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns. Use of 'hasattr' for __fspath__ detection is standard for path object compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if 'paths' is iterable and not a string or binary; if so, converts it to a list. If not a list, wraps 'paths' in a list. Then, it converts any path-like objects (supporting __fspath__) into strings. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. It performs expected type conversions for file paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard utility for handling file paths; no malicious behavior, no security risks identified.",
