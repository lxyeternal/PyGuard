  "purpose": "This script provides a function to securely delete files or directories by moving them to the system trash/recycle bin using Windows COM interfaces.",
  "sources": "Input paths provided to the send2trash() function, which can come from user input or other parts of a larger application.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Windows COM interfaces (shell.SHCreateItemFromParsingName, fileop.DeleteItem, fileop.PerformOperations) that execute delete operations, and the potential for exceptions to be raised.",
  "flows": "Paths are preprocessed and then passed to COM objects for deletion; errors or abort signals can propagate from COM operations to exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code detected. The code correctly initializes and uninitializes COM components, following standard practices. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles file deletion via Windows shell COM objects, with careful path preprocessing and OS version checks. It uses standard COM interfaces and flags appropriate for silent deletion, optionally using recycle bin features on Windows 8+. Error handling converts COM errors into Python OSError exceptions, maintaining proper error reporting. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration is present. The code's structure and library usage appear standard and intended solely for file deletion with safety considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a safe file deletion function using Windows COM interfaces, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It correctly handles errors and system interactions without suspicious anomalies.",
