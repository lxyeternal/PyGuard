  "purpose": "This code provides a function to securely delete files or paths by moving them to the recycle bin on Windows systems, utilizing COM interfaces and platform-specific flags.",
  "sources": "Input paths provided to the send2trash function, including preprocess_paths and path manipulations.",
  "sinks": "COM object methods for deleting items and performing operations, which could be exploited if untrusted paths are manipulated maliciously to delete unintended files.",
  "flows": "Input paths are processed and converted to full, sanitized paths, then used to create COM items which are deleted via the shell's file operation methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. It uses standard Windows COM interfaces for file operations. No obfuscation, no hidden network activity or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes COM, processes input paths to ensure correct formatting, and invokes Windows shell COM interfaces to delete files securely with specified flags. Error handling converts COM errors into standard OSError exceptions. The code appears straightforward, with standard library and COM interactions, and no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed solely for secure deletion of files using Windows COM interfaces. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a legitimate utility function with proper error handling and platform-specific flag management.",
