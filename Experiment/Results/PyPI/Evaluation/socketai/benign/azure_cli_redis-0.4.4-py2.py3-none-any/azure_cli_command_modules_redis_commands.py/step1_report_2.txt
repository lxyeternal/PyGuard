  "purpose": "Define command groups and commands for Azure Redis services CLI extension, enabling management of Redis instances, patch schedules, firewall rules, and server links.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Azure SDK modules and client factory functions, which provide data about Redis resources.",
  "sinks": "Command execution functions such as 'cli_redis_create', 'delete', 'cli_redis_export', 'force_reboot', etc., which perform actions based on user commands.",
  "flows": "User invokes CLI commands → command functions are called → corresponding SDK operations are executed to manage Redis resources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. All code appears to follow standard CLI extension patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up CLI command groups and binds commands to functions that perform management operations via SDK client factories. No input/output data handling, environment variable misuse, or code injection mechanisms are present. The client factory functions and command handlers are standard and do not show signs of malicious code. The structure aligns with typical Azure CLI extension development, with no anomalies or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI extension setup for managing Azure Redis resources. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows are evident. The code appears safe and solely focused on resource management commands.",
