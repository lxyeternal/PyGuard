  "purpose": "Define help documentation for Redis management CLI commands in Azure.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains static help strings and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or execution points.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static help documentation setup.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, data handling, or external data sources; all help strings are hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a help_files module and defines multiple help descriptions for various Redis CLI commands, such as create, export, import, list, update, and firewall rules. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic logic. The help strings are static, predefined, and only describe CLI command behavior. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for static documentation purposes within a CLI context and does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign component for help documentation with no indicators of malicious activity.",
