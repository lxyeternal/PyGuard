  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, likely as part of a larger package structure.",
  "sources": "The __name__ variable used in declare_namespace",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "None, as the code only declares a namespace without data flow or input/output",
  "anomalies": "Use of namespace declaration is standard; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' with __name__, which is a common pattern in Python packaging to declare namespace packages. There are no data sources, no untrusted input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious logic. The code is minimal and adheres to standard practices for namespace declaration, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely declares a namespace for packaging purposes, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
