  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, enabling it to be part of a namespace package.",
  "sources": "No input sources; code only declares a namespace.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard namespace declaration with no suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace using 'declare_namespace'. This is a common practice for namespace packages in Python, often used to allow multiple distribution packages to contribute to the same namespace. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or malicious data handling. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard package practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a legitimate package setup process.",
