  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package to enable sharing a common namespace across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication",
  "flows": "None; static namespace declaration without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard boilerplate code, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and calls declare_namespace(__name__), a common pattern for namespace packages. It contains no input handling, network activity, or malicious code. The code is minimal, straightforward, and adheres to standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign namespace declaration used in Python packaging. There are no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, consistent, and require no modifications.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
