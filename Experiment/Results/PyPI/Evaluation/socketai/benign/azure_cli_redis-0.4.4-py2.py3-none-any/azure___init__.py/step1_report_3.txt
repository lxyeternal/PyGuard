  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for organizing Python modules under a common namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statement: import pkg_resources",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only declares a namespace",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no unusual constructs or hardcoded secrets; usage of declare_namespace is standard for namespace packages",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' library and declares the current package as a namespace using 'declare_namespace'. This is a common pattern in Python to allow multiple distribution packages to share a namespace. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code is minimal and follows standard practices for namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward namespace package declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
