  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package to enable namespace sharing across multiple distributions",
  "sources": "The import of pkg_resources and the declare_namespace call",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "No data flows identified; no untrusted data processing observed",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs namespace declaration, which is a standard practice in namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current module as a namespace, which is a common pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It does not read input, process untrusted data, or perform any network or system operations. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The code is minimal and adheres to standard packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration used in Python packaging. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk present.",
