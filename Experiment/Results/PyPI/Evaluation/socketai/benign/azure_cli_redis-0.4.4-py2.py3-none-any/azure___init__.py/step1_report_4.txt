{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, typically used for modular packaging.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only performs a namespace declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for namespace declaration, and shows no unusual or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace using 'declare_namespace(__name__)', which is a standard practice for namespace packages. It contains no input handling, no data processing, and no potentially malicious code or obfuscation. The license comment at the top is a typical header for open-source code from Microsoft. Overall, this appears to be benign boilerplate code for setting up namespace packages.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard namespace declaration code for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks.",
