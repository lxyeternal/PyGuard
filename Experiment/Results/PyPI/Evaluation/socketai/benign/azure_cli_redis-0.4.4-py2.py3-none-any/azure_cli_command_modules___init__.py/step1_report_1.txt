  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data passage is observable.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains namespace declaration with no other logic; no anomalies or suspicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only namespace declaration using pkg_resources. This is a common pattern for namespace packages and does not involve data handling, user input, or external communication. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is benign and typical in Python package development.",
