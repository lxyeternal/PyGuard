  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not handle external input or output.",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources -> call to declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard for namespace declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace with declare_namespace(__name__). It is a common pattern in Python packaging, with no data handling, external communication, or dynamic execution. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0.0, securityRisk: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, confidence: 1.0) are appropriate and justified based on the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no security risks or malicious activity. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is consistent. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
