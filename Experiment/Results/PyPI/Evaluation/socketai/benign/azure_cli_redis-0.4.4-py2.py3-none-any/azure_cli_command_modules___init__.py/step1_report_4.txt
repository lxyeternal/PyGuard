  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, likely for modular package management or plugin system.",
  "sources": "No direct input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; only namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only namespace declaration; no suspicious or unusual code activities.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace, which is a common practice in Python packaging to support namespace packages. No input, output, or data processing occurs. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated parts are present. The code is minimal and standard for package namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign component of a package setup.",
