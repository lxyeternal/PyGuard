  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for modular distribution of a Python package",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources and declaration of namespace with __name__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations present",
  "flows": "None, as the code only declares a namespace without data flow",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no unusual or suspicious constructs; namespace declaration is standard practice",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace, which is a common method for modular packages. No hardcoded secrets, no data transmission, no dynamic code execution. The code is minimal and appears to be a standard setup for namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It does not perform any operations beyond namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical namespace declaration for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors.",
