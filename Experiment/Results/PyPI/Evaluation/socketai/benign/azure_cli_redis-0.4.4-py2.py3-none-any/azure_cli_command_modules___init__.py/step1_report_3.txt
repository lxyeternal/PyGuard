  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package to enable namespace package behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statement that loads the 'pkg_resources' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no untrusted data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'pkg_resources.declare_namespace' is a standard pattern for namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current package as a namespace package, which is a standard practice in Python packaging to allow multiple distribution packages to contribute to a single namespace. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows indicating malicious activity. The code is minimal and follows common patterns without any obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical package setup component.",
