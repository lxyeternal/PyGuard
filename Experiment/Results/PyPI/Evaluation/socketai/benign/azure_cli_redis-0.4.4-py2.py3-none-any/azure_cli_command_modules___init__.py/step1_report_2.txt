  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for the package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The module imports pkg_resources and calls declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow beyond namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of declare_namespace suggests namespace packaging; no suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and solely performs namespace declaration via pkg_resources. This is a standard practice in Python package development for namespace packages. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not contain obfuscation, dynamic execution, or other anomalies. It appears to be part of a legitimate namespace package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is typical of package structure setup and contains no malicious behavior.",
