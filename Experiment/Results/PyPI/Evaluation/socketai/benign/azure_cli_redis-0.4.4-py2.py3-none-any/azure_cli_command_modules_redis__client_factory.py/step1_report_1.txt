  "purpose": "Factory functions for creating Redis management client objects in Azure CLI extensions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, function arguments (cli_ctx), and get_mgmt_service_client calls.",
  "targets": "Return statements providing Redis management clients, with no untrusted data manipulation.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> call get_mgmt_service_client -> return specific Redis client attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four functions that import necessary modules and invoke a client factory to retrieve specific Redis management service components. All functions use the provided cli_ctx argument to obtain clients, and then return specific properties. There is no user input processing, no data leakage, nor any suspicious external communication or code injection points. The code appears standard for Azure CLI extensions managing Redis resources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, primarily importing modules and returning client objects for Redis management. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe for use.",
