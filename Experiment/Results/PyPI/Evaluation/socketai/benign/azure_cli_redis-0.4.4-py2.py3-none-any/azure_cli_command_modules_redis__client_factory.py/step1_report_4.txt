  "purpose": "Factory functions to create Redis management clients for Azure CLI commands.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: azure.cli.core.commands.client_factory and azure.mgmt.redis; usage of cli_ctx parameter for client creation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameter cli_ctx used to instantiate management clients; no data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, repetitive, and standard for client factory functions; no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions that generate Azure Redis management client instances using a provided CLI context. It imports necessary modules within each function to maintain modularity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The functions are typical for SDK or CLI integrations. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious code structures are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard factory functions for creating Azure Redis management clients. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code is well-structured and follows common patterns for Azure CLI extensions.",
