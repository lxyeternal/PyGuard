  "purpose": "Factory functions for creating Redis management clients in Azure CLI extensions.",
  "sources": "The functions import modules and call get_mgmt_service_client with cli_ctx, then return specific client attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process user input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input: cli_ctx; Output: specific Redis client objects; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward SDK client factory functions, importing modules, invoking get_mgmt_service_client, and returning client attributes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard for Azure CLI extensions and does not process untrusted input or perform network operations. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk scores. Confidence levels are high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK factory functions with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
