  "anomalies": "Use of namespace declaration is standard; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace for the current module, which is common in namespace packages. It does not read any input, process data, or contain any suspicious constructs. There is no malicious behavior or obfuscation present. The code is minimal and standard for namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration without any malicious intent or security risks. It serves to support package organization and does not perform any harmful actions.",
