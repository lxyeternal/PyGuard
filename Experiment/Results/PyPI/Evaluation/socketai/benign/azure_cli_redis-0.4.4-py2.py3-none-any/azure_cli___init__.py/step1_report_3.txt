{
  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, enabling extension or plugin mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Imported 'pkg_resources' module, which reads package metadata and manages resource access.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flow; code simply declares namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'declare_namespace' which is common in namespace packages but can be misused for namespace hijacking if combined with malicious code. No other anomalies or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current module as a namespace package, which is a standard practice for package extensibility. It contains only licensing comments and a single namespace declaration. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present. The minimal code suggests a benign purpose with no data leaks or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a typical setup step for a Python package, and there are no indications of security risks or malware.",
