{
  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package as part of a larger project, following namespace package conventions.",
  "sources": "import statement for pkg_resources and namespace declaration",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no dynamic execution or data handling observed",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a standard practice in Python packaging and does not involve any dynamic code execution, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The absence of data input, output, or external communication points indicates no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard namespace declaration for Python packages, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
