  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for Python packaging using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module, invocation of declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, external communication, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources → declare_namespace(__name__) (no data flow beyond namespace declaration).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of data input/output, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace with declare_namespace(__name__), a standard pattern in Python for namespace packages. It contains no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 justified by its simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
