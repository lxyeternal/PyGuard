  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Reading the module name (__name__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "None present; code only declares namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard namespace declaration without additional suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace with __name__. This is a common pattern in Python packages to allow namespace packages. No inputs are processed, no data is read from external sources, and there are no suspicious or malicious instructions. The code is minimal, standard, and lacks any indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward namespace declaration typical of Python packages. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
