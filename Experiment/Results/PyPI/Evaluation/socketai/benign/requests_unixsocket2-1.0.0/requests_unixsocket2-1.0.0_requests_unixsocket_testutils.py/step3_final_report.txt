  "purpose": "Utilities for testing Unix socket servers, creating a server in a thread, generating socket filenames from system info, and managing server lifecycle with threading.",
  "sources": "System info used to generate socket filename, environment variables in headers, internal server map (self.server._map).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input reaches sensitive sinks; environment variables are from request data; server response is static.",
  "flows": "System info and environment variables influence socket filename and headers; server runs in thread; cleanup via internal map clearing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of self.server._map.clear() could be risky if misused outside testing but is acceptable here; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign testing utility for Unix socket servers, generating filenames from system identifiers, managing server lifecycle with threads, and responding with static data. No untrusted input is processed maliciously, and no backdoors or obfuscation are present. The internal map clearing is a potential risk if misused outside testing but is intended for cleanup within this context. Environment variables used are standard in WSGI and do not introduce security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured testing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
