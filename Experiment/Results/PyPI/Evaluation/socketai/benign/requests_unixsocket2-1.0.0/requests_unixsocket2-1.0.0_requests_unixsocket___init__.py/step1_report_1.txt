{
  "purpose": "This code provides a custom requests Session with Unix socket support and monkeypatches for HTTP methods, enabling flexible HTTP requests, potentially for testing or specialized network communication.",
  "sources": "sys.modules['requests'] (accessed in _get_global_requests_module), and method parameters such as url, method, data, json, kwargs in request functions.",
  "sinks": "requests module's method calls (request, get, head, post, etc.) which perform network operations with URLs and data inputs.",
  "flows": "Source: function parameters (url, data, json) or sys.modules access -> Sink: calls to requests methods which execute network requests.",
  "anomalies": "The code monkeypatches the requests library globally, replacing core HTTP methods with potentially altered versions. The monkeypatch class overwrites request methods with global references without apparent validation, which can be misused for malicious tracking or intercepting requests. There are no evident hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code, but the global monkeypatching approach can be risky if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Session class with Unix socket support via a custom adapter. The monkeypatch class intercepts and replaces standard requests methods globally, which could be used maliciously to intercept or modify network requests. The functions at the end recreate standard request functions, all using the custom Session or monkeypatched methods. No malicious payloads like data exfiltration, reverse shells, or suspicious domain connections are directly present, but the monkeypatch mechanism can be exploited for request hijacking or privacy violations. The code appears to be designed for controlled testing or specialized network communication, not inherently malicious but with potential security implications if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily provides enhanced HTTP request handling with Unix socket support and globally monkeypatches the requests library methods. While no explicit malicious behavior or malware is evident, the global monkeypatching approach introduces a security risk if used maliciously, as it can intercept or alter network requests. Overall, it does not contain malware but warrants caution due to its monkeypatching design.",
