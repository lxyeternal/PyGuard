      "conclusion": "The code is a utility for specialized HTTP requests with monkeypatching for testing or internal use. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the monkeypatching technique, which can be exploited if environment security is compromised. Overall, the code is safe but warrants caution in untrusted contexts."
