{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS KMS-related string constants for type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions for literals, import statements for typing based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, primarily static definitions with no data flow or runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and only defines literal types and imports. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version, then defines numerous Literal types for AWS KMS and other services. All string constants appear to be standard AWS service identifiers, API parameter options, and resource names. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or malicious constructs are present. The file serves as a static typing aid. The structure and content do not suggest obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type definitions module for AWS SDK type annotations. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
