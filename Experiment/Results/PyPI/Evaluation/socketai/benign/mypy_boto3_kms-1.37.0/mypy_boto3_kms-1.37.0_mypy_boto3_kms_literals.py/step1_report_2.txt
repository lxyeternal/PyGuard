  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS KMS service literals for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for various string-based types, conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; code primarily declares constants.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows or input/output operations detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated structures present. Usage of conditional import based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various AWS KMS related string literals. It conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on Python version, which is a common practice. The literal definitions are straightforward, static string collections used for type safety and documentation. There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, or data handling that could be malicious. The code is purely declarative, serving as a static type mapping, with no signs of backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a benign, static declaration of string literals used for type annotations in AWS SDK. It contains no malicious intent or malicious code structures. No supply chain security risks or malware behavior are present.",
