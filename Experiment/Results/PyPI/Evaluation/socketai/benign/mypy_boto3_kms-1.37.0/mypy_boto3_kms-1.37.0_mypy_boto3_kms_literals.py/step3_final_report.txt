  "purpose": "Define static type aliases for AWS KMS and related service string literals to enhance type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals representing AWS KMS algorithms, error codes, resource names, and service identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A - static declarations only, no data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static type alias definitions with conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal for AWS KMS and related constants. It conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, which is standard. There are no dynamic operations, external data handling, or malicious constructs. The literals are standard AWS resource identifiers and options. No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code serves as a static type annotation aid, with no runtime logic or external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and solely for type safety. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
