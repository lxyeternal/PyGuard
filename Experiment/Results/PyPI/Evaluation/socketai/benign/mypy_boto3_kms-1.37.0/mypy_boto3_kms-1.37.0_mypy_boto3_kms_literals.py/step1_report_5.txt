  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS KMS service parameters and constants for use in type annotations and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and typing.Literal; defines multiple Literal type aliases with string values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow from untrusted sources; the code is solely type definitions and string literals.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks, only static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of straightforward type alias definitions, conditional import for typing.Literal based on Python version, and extensive string literal lists.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a collection of string literal type annotations for AWS KMS and other AWS service constants. It conditionally imports 'Literal' for compatibility with Python versions before 3.12. No external input, dynamic execution, or data processing occurs. No signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code structure is typical for type stub definitions, with no obfuscated code or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard type annotation module defining string literal types for AWS services. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks detected. Its purpose is solely for type safety and documentation within Python projects.",
