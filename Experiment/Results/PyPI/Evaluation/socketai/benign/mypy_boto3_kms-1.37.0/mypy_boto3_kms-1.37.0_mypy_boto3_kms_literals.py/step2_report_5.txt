  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, defining string literals for AWS KMS and related services.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or network operations are present.\n- The purpose is clearly for type safety and documentation.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no evidence of issues like hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n   - The conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent; they correctly identify the static nature and benign purpose.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` score as 0, which aligns with their analysis.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - The highest risk score is 0.5, but all reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malware present.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on static analysis.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a static, benign set of type annotations for AWS KMS literals.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code is a well-structured, safe, static type definition module for AWS SDK literals. No further action or concern is warranted.",
