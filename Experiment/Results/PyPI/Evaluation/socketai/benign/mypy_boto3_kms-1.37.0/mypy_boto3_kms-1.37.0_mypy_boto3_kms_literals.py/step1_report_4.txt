{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS KMS service constants and related identifiers to enhance type safety and documentation clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'sys' module to determine Python version, and defines several Literal type variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or external data outputs are present; the code only declares type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is solely defining static type literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code includes only type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by importing sys and conditionally importing Literal from typing or typing_extensions depending on Python version, which is standard practice. It then defines numerous Literal type aliases for various AWS-related constants, identifiers, and options. These definitions serve as type hints for other code interacting with AWS KMS services. There is no execution of dynamic code, no network operations, no file manipulations, nor any inclusion of obfuscated or malicious code. The comments and structure are consistent with well-documented, purpose-specific type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS KMS service literals. It appears to be designed solely for type safety and documentation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is safe and benign.",
