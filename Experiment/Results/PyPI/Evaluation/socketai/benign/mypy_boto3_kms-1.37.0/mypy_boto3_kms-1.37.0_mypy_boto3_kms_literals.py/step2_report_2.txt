  "review": "Let's review the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe a static, type annotation module defining AWS KMS and related service string literals, with conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version. They emphasize that the code is purely declarative, with no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions. The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity Checks:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code?**  \n  The code matches the description: static literal definitions, conditional import, no dynamic code, no external data, no execution. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and purely for type safety. They do not overlook any hidden behaviors or suspicious constructs. The reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk)?**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Scores:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Given the static nature and absence of malicious code, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. No signs of backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques. The use of conditional import is standard for compatibility, not obfuscation. Score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The overall security risk is negligible. The code only defines constants for type annotations, with no runtime or external dependencies that could introduce risk. Score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they explicitly state the code is benign.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's static, non-malicious nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS SDK literals. It does not execute any malicious behavior, obfuscate logic, or handle untrusted data. The conditional import for Python version compatibility is standard practice, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is safe, benign, and serves solely as a static type annotation aid for AWS SDK usage.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0). No changes needed.",
