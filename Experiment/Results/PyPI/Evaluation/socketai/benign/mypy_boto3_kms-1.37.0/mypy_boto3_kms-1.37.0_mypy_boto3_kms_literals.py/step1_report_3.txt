{
  "purpose": "Define Python literal types for various AWS KMS and related service string constants for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to variables, imported modules (sys, typing_extensions), and the code's own string literals.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic data processing, user input, or external data sources; only static definitions.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines constants and type aliases without any data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or hidden functionalities. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of license and documentation info, but no malicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS KMS service literals, conditionally importing 'Literal' based on Python version. It defines various Literal types for use elsewhere, with no data manipulation, input/output, or external calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The code appears to be a benign, structured set of constants for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely a static definition of AWS KMS-related string literals and type aliases for static analysis, with no malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks present.",
