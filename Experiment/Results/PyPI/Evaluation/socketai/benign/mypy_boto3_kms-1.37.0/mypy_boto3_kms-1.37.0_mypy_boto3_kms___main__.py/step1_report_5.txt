{
  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about a Python package, including version and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, reading sys.argv for command-line input.",
  "flows": "User input in sys.argv can trigger print_version, which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code simply outputs static information without external data fetching or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining functions to print static package information and version. It checks command-line arguments to determine which info to print. There are no inputs from untrusted sources beyond command-line args, no network operations, and no code execution beyond simple string output. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a benign CLI utility that outputs package info and version. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, no external network activity, and no sensitive data handling. Overall, it is safe.",
