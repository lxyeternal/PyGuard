  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward CLI utility that displays static package info or version based on command-line input.\n- No external data fetching, network activity, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- The functions are simple print statements, and the control flow is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.  \n  **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws in reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent, thorough, and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the code as a benign CLI utility with no security concerns.  \n  **Conclusion:** No logical errors or flaws in reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  - **malware:** 0 across all reports  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0 across all reports  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0 across all reports  \n  - **confidence:** 1 (or 1.0), which is appropriate given the clear analysis.\n\n- **Are these scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The code is simple, static, and contains no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- **Why are the scores at 0?**  \n  Because the code does not perform any malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk.  \n  **No justification exists for increasing these scores.**\n\n---\n\n### Malware Score Consideration:\n- **Is there any malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code only outputs static information.  \n  **Scores of 0 are justified.**\n\n---\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:\n- The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions about vulnerabilities, as none are evident.  \n- No external inputs, no data leaks, no code injection, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.  \n- The scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **My own estimate:**  \n  - **malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)  \n  - **securityRisk:** 0 (no security issues)  \n\n- **Additional notes:**  \n  The code is a simple, safe CLI utility. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0**",
