  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check -> print_version or print_info -> stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version. It uses standard Python modules with no external dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The control flow is simple, with functions for printing static info and version, triggered by command-line flags. No dynamic code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reviews, with all assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's simplicity and static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
