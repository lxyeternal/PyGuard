  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input argument; sys.stdout for output display",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for printing information to stdout",
  "flows": "Command line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs straightforward info printing with no external network activity or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs package and version info based on command line arguments. It reads input from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout. There are no external network connections, no data leaks, and no suspicious or malicious code constructs. No code injection, environment variable misuse, or insecure operations are present. The code structure is clear, and the functions are simple print statements, indicating no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility intended to display package information and version details. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks.",
