  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a simple CLI utility that prints static package info or version based on command-line argument.\n- No dynamic code, external calls, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify that the code only performs static output, with no malicious behavior.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code is straightforward, static, and contains no malicious behavior, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n- The `malware` score of 0 is justified.\n- The `securityRisk` score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware score**\n\n- No malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is safe, benign, and does not pose any security threat.\n- The scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n- The confidence remains high, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the current evaluation is correct.",
