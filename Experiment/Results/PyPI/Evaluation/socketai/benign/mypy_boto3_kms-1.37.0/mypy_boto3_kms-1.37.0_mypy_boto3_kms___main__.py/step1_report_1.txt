  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package, including version and package details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input flags; sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for printing information.",
  "flows": "Input (sys.argv) → conditional check → output to sys.stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI entry point that checks for the '--version' argument to display the package version, otherwise prints package info. It uses standard Python functions and system modules with no external calls, network activity, or data manipulation. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code structure and logic are straightforward, aiming only at providing static package information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a straightforward CLI utility. It contains no malicious intent, no security risks, and no anomalies suggesting sabotage or malware.",
