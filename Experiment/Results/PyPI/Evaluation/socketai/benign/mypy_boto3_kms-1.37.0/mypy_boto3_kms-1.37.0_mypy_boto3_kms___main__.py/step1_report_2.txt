{
  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 KMS.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, reads from sys.stdout via print_info and print_version functions.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to sys.stdout in both print_info and print_version functions.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (--version) triggers print_version, otherwise print_info is called, leading to stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or external data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code simply provides CLI output based on input arguments. It imports sys to handle command-line arguments and output. The functions are straightforward, printing static package info or version. No external data fetching, no user input processing beyond argument check, and no insecure operations or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI interface for informational output with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard utility script.",
