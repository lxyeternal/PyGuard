  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a straightforward static string assignment with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to __version__, with a copyright comment. It contains no dynamic code, inputs, external data reads, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is standard for version declaration in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The code is safe, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
