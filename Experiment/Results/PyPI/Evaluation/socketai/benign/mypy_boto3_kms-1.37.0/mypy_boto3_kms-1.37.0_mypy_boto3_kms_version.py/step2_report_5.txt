  "review": "Let's review the provided reports and the original code carefully:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present\n- The code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No dynamic code, external data, or malicious constructs.\n- The code is standard practice for Python packages.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Review each report's reasoning and scores\n\n**Reports Summary:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward version declaration.\n- All assign `__version__` to a static string.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or suspicious code.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, and malware/security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The comments and code are minimal and typical.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports give malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- These scores are appropriate given the code.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is trivial, no score adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Justify any higher risk scores\n- The highest risk score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- No reason to assign a higher score, as there's no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risk.\n\n### Step 4: Challenge assumptions\n- No assumptions are made in the reports that could be challenged.\n- The code is standard and safe.\n\n### Step 5: Consistency of scores\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the simplicity and standard nature of this code, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**However,** if I were to assign my own scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is a typical version declaration with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that version files remain simple and free of hidden code, which is the case here.",
