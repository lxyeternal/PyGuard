  "purpose": "Define and store the version of the package or module",
  "sources": "The assignment of the version string to __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard version declaration with a comment header",
  "analysis": "The code includes a comment about the source of truth for versioning and sets a version string to __version__. The version string is hardcoded as '1.37.0'. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data sources, and no suspicious code constructs. The copyright notice is standard and does not introduce any risk. Overall, the code performs a simple, benign assignment typical of package version declarations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard practice in Python modules to define __version__ this way.",
