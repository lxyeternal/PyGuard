  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - The code does not contain any dynamic behaviors, inputs, or external data reads.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that there are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; they seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All scores for `malware` and `securityRisk` are 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - No reason to increase the risk scores since there are no signs of malicious activity or security concerns.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - The assessments are aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** Purely a static version string assignment.\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments. The code is benign, standard, and contains no security issues.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code and the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.",
