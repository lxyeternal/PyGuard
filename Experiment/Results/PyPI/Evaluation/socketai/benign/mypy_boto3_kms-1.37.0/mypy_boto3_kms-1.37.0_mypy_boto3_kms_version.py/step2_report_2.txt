  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   The code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable, accompanied by a copyright comment. All reports agree that there are no inputs, external data reads, dynamic code, or malicious constructs.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: they correctly identify that this is a straightforward, benign version declaration. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.  \n   **Conclusion:** No errors or flaws in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   All reports assign scores with `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`. Given the code's simplicity, these scores seem appropriate.  \n   **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   Since the code is purely a static version string assignment with no dynamic or suspicious behavior, risk scores should remain at 0.5 or below, ideally 0.  \n   **Conclusion:** Risk scores should be 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n   **Conclusion:** No malware concerns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   All reports correctly avoid assumptions, sticking to observable facts.  \n   **Conclusion:** No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks. All reports are correct, and the scoring is appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
