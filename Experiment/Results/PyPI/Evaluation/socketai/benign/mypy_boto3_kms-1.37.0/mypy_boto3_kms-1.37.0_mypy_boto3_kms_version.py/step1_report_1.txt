  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; straightforward version assignment with no hidden or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the __version__ variable. The comment indicates a source of truth for versioning, and the copyright notice is standard. There are no inputs, external data reads, or dynamic code execution. The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. It is a minimal, typical version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple assignment statement, and there are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.",
