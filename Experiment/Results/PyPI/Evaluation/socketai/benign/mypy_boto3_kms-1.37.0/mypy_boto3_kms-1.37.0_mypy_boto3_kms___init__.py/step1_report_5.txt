{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface for a KMS (Key Management Service) client, providing import statements, type annotations, and module exports for interacting with AWS KMS through boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or external data sources; it primarily imports modules and defines exports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data outputs or data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is purely declarative and structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The comments and structure follow standard documentation and import conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and paginator objects from local modules, defines an alias for KMSClient, and specifies module exports. It includes a documentation string with example usage, but no dynamic or executable code beyond imports and definitions. No user input handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing are observed. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for AWS KMS client interaction, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign, well-structured interface module.",
