{
  "purpose": "Main interface module for the KMS (Key Management Service), providing access to client and paginator classes for managing cryptographic keys and related resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), likely internal to the package.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs or outputs; only defining class imports and module exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; purely static import and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code. The code contains documentation and standard class and function definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines imports from internal modules and an alias for a client class, then exports these for external use. No data input, network activity, or executable logic is present. No suspicious code structures, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The only notable aspect is the documentation referencing a URL and copyright info, which are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard interface module for a Python SDK related to AWS KMS. There is no indication of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks within this snippet. It is a safe and typical package interface definition.",
