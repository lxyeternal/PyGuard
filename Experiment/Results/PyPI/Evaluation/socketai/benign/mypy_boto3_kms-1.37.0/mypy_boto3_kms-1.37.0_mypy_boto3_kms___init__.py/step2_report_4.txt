  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Content**:\n   - The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes and paginator objects from local modules (.client and .paginator), assigns an alias `Client` to `KMSClient`, and defines an `__all__` list for exports.\n   - It contains a documentation string with usage examples, but no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security-sensitive operations.\n\n2. **Security Concerns & Anomalies**:\n   - The reports uniformly identify that the code is a simple interface module, with no external data input/output, no network activity, and no handling of sensitive data.\n   - The only unusual element is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future but not suspicious.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These assessments are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Malicious Behavior**:\n   - Given the code's static and import-only nature, there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n   - The code does not execute any logic, handle untrusted data, or perform network operations.\n   - The documentation includes usage examples, which are benign.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Recommendations**:\n   - The code appears to be a standard, benign module defining an interface for AWS KMS SDK interactions.\n   - No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n   - The risk scores correctly reflect the absence of security concerns.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, this is a clean, standard interface module with no security issues.**",
