{
  "purpose": "This module provides an interface for AWS KMS services by importing client and paginator classes, defining an alias, and exporting symbols for external use. It serves as a structural setup for SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and documentation strings; no untrusted input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data outputs; the code does not process or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code only imports and exports class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual element is the copyright year '2025,' which is in the future but not suspicious or indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that imports classes from local modules, assigns an alias, and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no executable logic, user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code. The documentation provides usage examples but does not execute any code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it is a benign SDK interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign interface module for AWS KMS SDK components with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
