{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports a main interface for the KMS service client and its paginators, facilitating usage of AWS KMS in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), no external or user input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no handling of untrusted data, network operations, or sensitive information processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external or untrusted sources; primarily module imports and constant exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present. The license year (2025) is in the future but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, an alias assignment, and an __all__ declaration, serving as a module interface. It does not execute any logic, handle input/output, or invoke external services. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a Python SDK interface to AWS KMS, with no malicious or security concerns identified. It appears to be a clean, standard interface definition.",
