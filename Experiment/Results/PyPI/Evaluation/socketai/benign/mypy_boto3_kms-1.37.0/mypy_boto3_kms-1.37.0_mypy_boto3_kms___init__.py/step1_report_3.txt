{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the AWS KMS service, including imports and exports of classes and paginators for managing cryptographic keys and related resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator), no external data sources or user inputs involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no handling of untrusted data, no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected, as the code primarily involves class and function definitions with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward, mainly module setup and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports classes and functions from local files, defines an alias for a client class, and specifies exports via __all__. It contains a documentation string with example usage, which includes no sensitive or risky operations. The code does not perform any input/output, network communication, or data handling that could be malicious. It appears to be a standard setup module for a Python SDK client interface, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module defining an interface for the KMS service with no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected. It is safe and primarily intended for use as part of a larger SDK.",
