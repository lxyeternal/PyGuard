  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS KMS service interactions, providing structured data types for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Static type annotations, constants import, and class definitions; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks are response objects and request parameters, but they are static and structured.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; all types are statically defined without data manipulation or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of TypedDict definitions and imports for type annotations, conditional imports based on Python version, and explicit exports. No executable logic, no external data processing, nor dynamic behaviors that could be malicious. The structure is consistent with API type definitions, and no suspicious or harmful code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of static type definitions intended for use with AWS KMS SDK interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. It appears to be a legitimate and well-structured type definitions module.",
