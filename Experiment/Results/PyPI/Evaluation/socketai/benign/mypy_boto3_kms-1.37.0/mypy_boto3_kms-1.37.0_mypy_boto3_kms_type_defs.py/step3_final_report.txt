  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS KMS in Python, serving as static type annotations and data structure schemas.",
  "sources": "Static type annotations, TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data flow, external data sources, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "None; purely declarative type definitions without data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for AWS KMS SDK in Python, utilizing TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for compatibility. It contains no executable logic, no external system interactions, and no obfuscation. The structure and content are consistent with standard type stub modules intended for static analysis and IDE support. No anomalies or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured static type definition module for AWS KMS in Python, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with its purpose.",
