  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: code presence, potential security issues, anomalies, and consistency of scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS KMS in Python.\n- No runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n- The code relies solely on static type annotations, TypedDicts, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The purpose appears to be aiding static analysis, IDE support, and code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS KMS in Python.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code; purely declarative.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS KMS in Python.\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious activity or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS KMS.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious code; purely static types.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS KMS.\n- **Findings:** No runtime logic or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS KMS.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm that the code is only static type definitions with no runtime or dynamic behavior.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, declarative code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, as there are no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:** None. The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's purpose.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured type stub module for AWS KMS in Python, serving purely as static type annotations. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications needed. The code is safe, benign, and purely for static type checking.",
