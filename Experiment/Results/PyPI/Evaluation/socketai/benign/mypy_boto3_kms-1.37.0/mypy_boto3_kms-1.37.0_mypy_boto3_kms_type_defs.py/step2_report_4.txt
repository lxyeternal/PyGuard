  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS KMS in Python, using standard typing modules and local literals.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime data flow or suspicious patterns; purely static type definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a comprehensive, well-structured set of type definitions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** High confidence (0.95), malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type definitions for AWS KMS, importing from standard and external modules.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime logic; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely declarative, designed for static analysis and IDE support, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Very high confidence (1.0), malware: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—type definitions for AWS KMS interactions.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime data flow, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type definitions, safe, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1.0, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations and data structures for AWS KMS.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No dynamic or untrusted data processing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, safe, purely for static type checking.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1.0, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others—type definitions for AWS KMS.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime logic or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, purely declarative code.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1.0, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code consists solely of static type definitions, TypedDict classes, conditional imports for compatibility, and constants. There is no executable logic, no data processing, no external system calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports identify any suspicious or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for type stub files.\n- **Security Risks:** No signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or sabotage. The purpose is clearly to facilitate static type checking for AWS KMS SDK in Python.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of the code, these scores are appropriate. It functions as a static type definition module, which inherently carries no runtime or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS KMS in Python, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It serves solely as a static schema to aid in type checking and documentation.",
