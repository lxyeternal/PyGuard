  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS KMS service in Python, providing data structures for request and response types, used for type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and local literals; definitions of TypedDict and Union types for various request/response structures.",
  "sinks": "None apparent. The code defines data structures without executing external commands or handling untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "N/A. The code purely defines types and structures, with no runtime data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network operations. The structure appears consistent with standard type definition files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for the AWS KMS SDK in Python, utilizing TypedDict, Union, and other typing constructs. It conditionally imports typing extensions based on Python version. No logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. All parts are typical for a type stubs module, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The code is purely declarative, serving as a schema for type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS KMS in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions solely as a static type declaration module to aid development and static analysis.",
