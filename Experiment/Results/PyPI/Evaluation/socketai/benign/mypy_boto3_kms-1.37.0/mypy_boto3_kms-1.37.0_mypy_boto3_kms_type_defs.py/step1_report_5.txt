  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for AWS KMS service interactions in Python, enabling type-checked API calls and responses.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and constant definitions that define data structures, such as request and response TypedDicts, union types, and literals. No external or dynamic data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that process untrusted input directly; the code is purely declarative with no execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows, as this code solely defines types and static data structures for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or obfuscated constructs, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or dynamic code execution. All elements are standard type annotations and data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS KMS SDK interactions using Python's typing system. It includes TypedDicts for request/response types, unions, and literals. There is no runtime logic, input handling, or data processing. All elements appear to serve the purpose of static type hinting for API clients. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, benign set of type definitions for AWS KMS SDK in Python. It is unlikely to be malicious or maliciously crafted. It primarily facilitates type checking and does not execute any data or perform network operations. No indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
