  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS KMS service using TypedDict for structured data representation.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, type annotations, class definitions, and data structure declarations.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no code execution or data output points, only data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as this code only defines types and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of standard Python typing and AWS SDK conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS KMS service interactions, using standard typing practices, conditional imports for compatibility, and structured TypedDict classes. No executable logic, external input processing, or network communication is present. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs such as code injection, data leakage, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe set of type definitions for AWS KMS SDK integration, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is intended for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
