  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS KMS service requests and responses in Python, used for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Defines data structures and type annotations, importing literals, typing modules, and external dependencies like botocore.response.StreamingBody.",
  "sinks": "None evident; code primarily declares data structures without executing untrusted data processing or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static type definitions do not include runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of comprehensive TypedDict class definitions for AWS KMS request and response types, conditional imports based on Python version, and importing external type definitions. It follows standard conventions for type annotations and does not perform any data processing or system modifications. No evidence of code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The module's sole purpose is to provide type definitions to assist static analysis and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining data structures for AWS KMS interactions. No malicious activity or security risks are identified. The code appears safe, intended solely for type hinting.",
