  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's structure, purpose, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a type annotation and interface layer for the AWS KMS client, with no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no malicious indicators.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is a static SDK stub primarily used for type safety and documentation. The absence of any runtime logic, network activity, or suspicious patterns indicates a very low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The code is benign and aligns with SDK documentation standards.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role as a static type stub with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no runtime logic or suspicious activity is present. The code is purely for static analysis and IDE support.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a type stub with no signs of malicious activity, focusing on its role for static typing.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is correct; no executable or dynamic code, no embedded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static interface with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed review confirms that the code is purely for type annotations and documentation, with no runtime or external network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing the purpose as a type-safe SDK stub with no malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The structure, purpose, and content align with standard SDK interface definitions. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports find any obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—purely static, interface, and type annotations—the overall security risk is negligible.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a well-structured, auto-generated or hand-crafted SDK stub for AWS KMS, serving as a static typing aid.\n- It contains no executable logic, no embedded secrets, no network operations, and no obfuscation.\n- The purpose is purely for static analysis, IDE support, and documentation referencing.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security Risk:** **0** (safe, standard SDK interface code)\n\n**In conclusion, this code is safe, benign, and serves as a static interface for AWS KMS interactions.**",
