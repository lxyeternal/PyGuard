{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for interacting with AWS KMS service using boto3 with added type hints and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class method definitions and property declarations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows from method parameters (kwargs) to return values, especially where untrusted input might be unpacked or used. No explicit sinks indicate data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from **kwargs are passed to AWS SDK methods; return types correspond to AWS responses; no explicit data flow leading to external network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of 'Unpack' with request type definitions is standard in type-hinted SDK wrappers. The code structure is consistent with auto-generated SDK stubs. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a strongly typed client class for AWS KMS, leveraging type annotations, method overloads for pagination, and detailed docstrings with links. The class methods simply wrap AWS SDK calls with type hints, no actual logic or data manipulation occurs within these methods. No suspicious code, external network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The initial import statements and class structure follow standard SDK design. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK stub implementation for AWS KMS with type annotations and documentation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to provide type safety and documentation for SDK usage. Overall, the code is benign and appears to be auto-generated or hand-crafted for SDK convenience.",
