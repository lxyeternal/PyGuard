  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS KMS service, providing method signatures and documentation references.",
  "sources": "The code sources are mainly from type definitions, method signatures, and inline documentation; it reads no external or untrusted input directly.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that accept input parameters for AWS API calls, but these are standard API interfaces with no evidence of malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit source-to-sink data flows; the code defines client methods and type signatures without executing data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. The code is standard for a type stub client interface, with clear structure and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and client method signatures for AWS KMS, intended for static type checking and IDE support. It uses standard Python typing features and docstrings referencing official AWS documentation. There are no runtime or dynamic code execution parts, no input/output operations, nor any suspicious logic. The absence of any executable code beyond interface definitions and type aliases suggests low likelihood of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK stub, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured type annotation and client interface definition for AWS KMS, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It serves as a static typing aid and documentation reference. No malicious or sabotage indicators are identified.",
