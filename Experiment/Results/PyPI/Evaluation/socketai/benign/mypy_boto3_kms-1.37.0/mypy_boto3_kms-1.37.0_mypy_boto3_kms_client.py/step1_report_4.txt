{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS KMS service, facilitating type-safe interactions with KMS API.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data, imports modules, and defines class attributes and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data is passed into methods that handle sensitive cryptographic operations or AWS resource identifiers; however, no explicit sinks that send data over the network are present outside AWS SDK calls.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into method parameters, which are then used to call AWS SDK functions; no custom flows of untrusted data are evident outside SDK interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code is mostly interface definitions, type annotations, and documentation links. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, method signatures with type annotations, and import statements for AWS SDK and type extensions. It includes extensive documentation references but lacks any implementation logic or network communication outside the AWS SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, unauthorized system access, or hidden backdoors. The structure is standard for a type stub or SDK interface, designed for static type checking and IDE support. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, well-structured type annotation interface for AWS KMS client. It does not contain any malicious logic or behaviors. It is safe to use within its intended context, serving as a type-safe wrapper around the AWS SDK.",
