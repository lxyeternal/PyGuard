{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS KMS boto3 client, serving as a static SDK stub for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, request/response type definitions, exception classes, and documentation links within the class and imports.",
  "sinks": "No data flows involving untrusted input; method parameters are used for API calls, responses are returned as structured types, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Parameters (kwargs) flow into API request calls; responses and exceptions flow back to the caller, following standard SDK patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; code is purely static with no runtime logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, statically-typed interface layer for the AWS KMS SDK, including method signatures, request/response types, and exception handling. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or data manipulation that could be malicious. The structure aligns with standard SDK stub generation, aimed at static analysis, IDE support, and type checking. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface for AWS KMS with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It is safe for use and poses no security risks.",
