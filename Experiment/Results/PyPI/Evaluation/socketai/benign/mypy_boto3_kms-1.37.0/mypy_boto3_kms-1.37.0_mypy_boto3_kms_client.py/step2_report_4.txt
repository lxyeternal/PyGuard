  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential issues, inconsistencies, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies the code as type annotations and interface definitions for AWS KMS in boto3, with no suspicious elements.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The data flows are standard for SDK interfaces; no untrusted input processing or malicious data handling is evident.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious patterns. The code is purely structural, providing type safety and documentation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the risk is very low (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Score Justification:** The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=0.95) are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly notes that the code is for static type checking and SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of malicious data handling or dynamic code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or backdoors; standard SDK stub code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, well-structured, safe.\n- **Score Justification:** The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, standard SDK stub with no suspicious elements.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is safe, with high confidence.\n- **Score Justification:** Scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous, describing a type stub for AWS KMS.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No signs of malicious data flow or suspicious handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no embedded malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with high confidence.\n- **Score Justification:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data handling or suspicious flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Score Justification:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's nature as static interface/type annotations.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- **Confidence Levels:** Very high (0.95 or 1), justified given the analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the scores assigned in all reports. The code is a standard, well-structured SDK stub for AWS KMS, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, non-malicious SDK interface, primarily serving as a static type and documentation aid. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
