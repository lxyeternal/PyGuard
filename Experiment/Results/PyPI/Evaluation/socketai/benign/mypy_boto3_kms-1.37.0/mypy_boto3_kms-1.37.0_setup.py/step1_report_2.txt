  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-kms', used to package and distribute type annotations for boto3 KMS service.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description; reads package data and metadata; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations. No network, file, or environment variable manipulations that are suspicious.",
  "flows": "The code reads static files and sets up package metadata; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code follows standard Python package setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It loads a markdown file for description and specifies package metadata and dependencies. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The script is straightforward and common for packaging Python modules. No obfuscated code, no network activity, and no manipulation of environment variables beyond standard requirements.",
