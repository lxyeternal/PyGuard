{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package for mypy-boto3-kms, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and uses static values for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or external data flows present in the code.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration reads static data; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup routine for packaging a Python library using setuptools. It reads a local markdown file for the long description, defines package metadata, classifiers, URLs, dependencies, and package data. All data used is static or file-based, with no user input or external untrusted data processed. There are no signs of malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The only external dependency is the 'setuptools' library, which is typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
