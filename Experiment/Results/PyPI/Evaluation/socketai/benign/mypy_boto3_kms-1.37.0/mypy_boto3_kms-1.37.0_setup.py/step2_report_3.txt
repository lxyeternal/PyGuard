  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the code step-by-step.\n\n**Overall Code Content:**\n- The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python library.\n- It reads a local README.md file for the long description.\n- It uses static values for package metadata, dependencies, and package data.\n- No user input, external data sources, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code imports only standard libraries and setuptools.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the script as a standard setup routine.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted input, no external data flows, no anomalies.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also correctly states this is a benign setup script.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; standard setup script.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; standard package setup.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious operations, no external data or dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, fitting the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly describes the script as a typical setup script.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no untrusted data, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, matching the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, since the script is a straightforward package setup with no security issues.\n\n**Given the evidence, I agree with the reports' conclusions and scores.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (standard package setup, no security risks)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are consistent and accurate.",
