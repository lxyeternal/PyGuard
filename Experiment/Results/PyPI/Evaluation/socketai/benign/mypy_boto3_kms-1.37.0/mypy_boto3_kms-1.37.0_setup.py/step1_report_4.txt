{
  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-kms package, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Read from __file__ to load README.md content; static package metadata; import statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all data used for configuration and metadata.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setup() function parameters; static imports -> setup() call; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a Python library. It reads a local README file, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and project URLs. All operations are static, and no untrusted input or external data is processed at runtime. There are no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It only handles package metadata and configuration, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
