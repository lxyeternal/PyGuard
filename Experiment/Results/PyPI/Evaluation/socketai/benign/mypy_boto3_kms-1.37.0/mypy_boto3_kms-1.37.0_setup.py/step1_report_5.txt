{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'mypy-boto3-kms' Python library, providing metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; importing standard 'Path' from pathlib; importing 'setup' from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "The script does not process or execute untrusted data; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading static file content into a variable for package metadata; no user input or untrusted data flow is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script. It reads a markdown file for long description, imports the setup function, and calls setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, user input, or suspicious behavior is observed. All dependencies and metadata are hardcoded or derived from local files. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely prepares the package metadata for distribution.",
