  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-kms library.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file; static package metadata and data definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or external data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without dynamic data or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, performing static file reading and defining package metadata. No dynamic code execution, external inputs, or obfuscated code are present. All signals indicate benign, standard packaging behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate and justified.",
