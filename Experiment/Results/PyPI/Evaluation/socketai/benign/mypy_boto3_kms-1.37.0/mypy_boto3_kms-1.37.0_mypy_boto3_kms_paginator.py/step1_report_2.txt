{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the AWS KMS service client, enabling static type checking and IDE support for paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from system modules (sys, typing), external libraries (botocore.paginate), and local type definitions. No user input or external data sources are accessed directly.",
  "sinks": "None apparent. The code defines classes and methods for paginating API responses without executing or handling untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Class methods (paginate) accept keyword arguments (untrusted inputs) and return PageIterator objects. No data is processed or transmitted outside method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code structure appears standard for type annotations of boto3 paginator classes. No unusual dynamic execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides paginator class definitions with type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links. It uses conditional imports for compatibility and employs standard Python typing patterns. No code executes external commands, network operations, or manipulates sensitive data. The code is static, well-structured, and typical for boto3 stub implementations. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of boto3 paginator type definitions with no malicious intent. It facilitates static type checking for AWS KMS client paginators. No security risks or malware are identified.",
