  "purpose": "Define typed paginator classes for KMS service client, enabling type-safe pagination of various KMS listing operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class methods accessing paginator functionalities.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or insecure outputs observed.",
  "flows": "The code initializes paginator classes and their paginate methods with unpacked keyword arguments, following standard pattern.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code strictly follows a standard pattern for boto3 stubs and pagination.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for boto3 KMS paginators, defining classes with paginate methods. Conditional imports ensure compatibility with Python 3.12+ and older versions. No external inputs, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code is a typical stub implementation for type safety, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation stub for boto3 KMS paginators, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate for use as intended.",
