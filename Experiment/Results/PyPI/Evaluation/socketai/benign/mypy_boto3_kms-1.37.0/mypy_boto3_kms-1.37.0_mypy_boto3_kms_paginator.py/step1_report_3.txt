  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS KMS service client, providing type-safe interfaces for pagination.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods with **kwargs; sys.version_info check for Unpack import.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being written, transmitted, or handled insecurely within this code.",
  "flows": "User calls paginate methods with keyword arguments, which are unpacked and passed to the parent class's paginate method; no external or untrusted data flows outside method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code structure is standard for type annotations and paginator class definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type-safe paginator classes for AWS KMS operations, utilizing conditional imports for Unpack depending on Python version, and establishing class methods that override base class paginate methods. All imports are from standard libraries and known AWS SDK modules, with no suspicious code or obfuscated patterns. The structure adheres to typical type annotation practices, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or anomalous logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-annotated paginator implementation for AWS KMS, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily serves to improve type safety and developer experience when working with paginated AWS SDK responses.",
