  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS KMS service client, enabling type-safe pagination for various KMS operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definitions, class definitions, and method implementations with parameter unpacking.",
  "sinks": "paginate methods calling superclass paginate, unpacking parameters, and returning PageIterator objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters via **kwargs flow into paginate methods; these are unpacked and passed to superclass methods, then return PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard patterns for typing and class extension. No network, file, or environment variable access appears.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with type annotations for AWS KMS operations, using conditional typing for compatibility. The methods mainly wrap superclass paginate calls with appropriate type annotations. No suspicious dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward type definition and class extension for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, type-safe wrapper classes for AWS boto3 paginators, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly focuses on providing type annotations and class structure for pagination support.",
