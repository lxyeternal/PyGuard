  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for AWS KMS paginators, enabling static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Class methods accepting kwargs, unpacked into superclass paginate methods, returning PageIterator objects.",
  "sinks": "No external data or untrusted input processing; methods only pass parameters and return iterators.",
  "flows": "kwargs unpacked in paginate methods, passed to superclass, returning PageIterator with response types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of boto3 paginator classes with type annotations, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and no external or runtime data handling. It serves as static stub code for IDE support and type safety, with no malicious or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely static, and designed for type annotations. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
