{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the AWS KMS service client, facilitating typed pagination support in boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; use of sys.version_info to determine typing extension imports; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data being written, transmitted, or handled insecurely within this code.",
  "flows": "This code defines classes that extend Paginator, with no direct data flow or untrusted input handling; paginate methods accept kwargs but do not process untrusted data internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures; standard paginator class patterns and type annotations are used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up paginator classes for the boto3 KMS client, with type annotations for request and response types. It uses conditional imports based on Python version, but no user data processing or external network calls are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code adheres to normal standards for SDK stub definitions, serving solely to provide typing support.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginators. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It is a standard implementation for enhancing type safety in boto3 client paginators.",
