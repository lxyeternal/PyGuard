  "purpose": "Utility functions for secure password input and environment detection.",
  "sources": "getpass.getpass() for password prompt; sys.stdin.isatty() for environment check.",
  "sinks": "None; input functions handle data locally without external transmission.",
  "flows": "User input via getpass; environment check via sys.stdin.isatty() — no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard library usage; no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple, standard utility functions for CLI password prompting and environment detection. It uses well-established libraries (`getpass`, `sys`) correctly. No hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, no malicious code, and no obfuscation. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified due to handling sensitive data, but overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate; they could be lowered to 0 for maximum confidence, but 0.1 remains reasonable given the context.",
