{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for obtaining user passwords and checking if the environment is interactive, primarily for CLI-based workflows.",
  "sources": "User input via getpass.getpass() and sys.stdin.isatty()",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data (passwords) collected via getpass.getpass()",
  "flows": "Input prompts (text) -> getpass.getpass() collects password -> sys.stdin.isatty() checks environment interactivity",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules getpass and sys for input handling. get_user_password prompts the user for a password without echoing input, which is standard practice. is_interactive checks whether the script is connected to a terminal, influencing behavior in interactive sessions. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for CLI password prompts and environment detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard utility for user password input and environment detection. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks beyond handling sensitive data in a typical manner. No malware or suspicious anomalies are present.",
