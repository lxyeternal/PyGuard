  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for securely obtaining user passwords and detecting interactive environments.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin.isatty() for environment detection; getpass.getpass() for password input",
  "sinks": "getpass.getpass() outputs password input to the console; sys.stdin.isatty() reads terminal state",
  "flows": "User inputs prompt -> password retrieved via getpass.getpass() -> environment check via sys.stdin.isatty()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; use of standard library functions for input and environment detection",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions: one for prompting the user for a password securely, and one for checking if the environment is interactive. Both functions use standard, well-known library functions with no malicious or unusual behavior. No hardcoded credentials, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is present. The code is straightforward and appears to be intended for typical CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard input and environment detection tasks without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is safe and typical for command-line utilities.",
