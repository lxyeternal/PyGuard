{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for securely obtaining a user password and checking if the environment is interactive, primarily for CLI applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input from the console via getpass.getpass() and checks sys.stdin.isatty() to determine interactivity.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks are present; user input is handled securely through getpass and environment checks do not expose data.",
  "flows": "The function get_user_password() takes a prompt text and returns a password securely; is_interactive() checks stdin status to determine environment type.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors; code uses standard libraries appropriately for secure password input and environment detection.",
  "analysis": "The code uses getpass for password input, which is designed to prevent password exposure in terminal history or process lists. It also checks stdin's isatty() to determine interactivity. Both are standard, safe practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be a utility module for CLI-based authentication workflows, with no data leaks, code injections, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for password handling and environment detection without any malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and employs safe practices.",
