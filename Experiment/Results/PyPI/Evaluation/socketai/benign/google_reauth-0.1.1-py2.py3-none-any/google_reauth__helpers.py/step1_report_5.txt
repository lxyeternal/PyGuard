  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for securely obtaining user passwords and checking for interactive environments.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin.isatty() for environment detection; getpass.getpass() for password input.",
  "sinks": "getpass.getpass() reads password input, which is standard; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "User input via getpass; environment detection via sys.stdin.isatty(). No untrusted data flow leading to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code simply wraps standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two functions: one for secure password input, the other for environment detection. Both utilize standard, safe library functions without any obfuscation or malicious logic. There are no data leaks, external communications, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module intended for CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It merely facilitates secure password prompts and environment checks, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
