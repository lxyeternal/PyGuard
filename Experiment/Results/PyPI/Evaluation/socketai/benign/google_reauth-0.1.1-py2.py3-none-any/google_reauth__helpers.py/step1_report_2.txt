{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for securely prompting user passwords and checking if the environment is interactive.",
  "sources": "sys.stdin.isatty() and getpass.getpass() functions, which read user input or interact with the terminal.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if sensitive data is mishandled, but in this context, primarily user input collection.",
  "flows": "User input is obtained via getpass.getpass(), and environment status is checked via sys.stdin.isatty(). No untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks beyond input collection.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the functions perform standard input handling with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code includes two functions: one for securely obtaining a password from the user using getpass.getpass(), which is a safe method for password input; and another to check if the environment is interactive by calling sys.stdin.isatty(). These are standard, well-understood utilities for CLI applications. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious data flows, or obfuscated segments. The code's purpose is clear, and no malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for user input handling and environment detection, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
