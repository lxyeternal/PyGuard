  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Utility functions for password input and environment detection.  \n- Findings: Uses standard libraries (`getpass`, `sys`) appropriately. No anomalies, no suspicious behavior.  \n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar utility functions.  \n- Findings: Same as above, with a minor note on potential data leakage if mishandled, but in this context, it's benign.  \n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, but justified as minimal).  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, just a cautious note on sensitive data handling.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Findings: Standard functions, no anomalies.  \n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and benign.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Same utility functions.  \n- Findings: No anomalies, standard library usage.  \n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Findings: No suspicious behavior, straightforward use of standard functions.  \n- Malware score: 0, Security risk: 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports describe code that is consistent, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The only slight deviation is in report 2, with a `securityRisk` score of 0.1, justified by potential data leakage concerns, but overall, the code remains benign.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present in any of the reports.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (utility functions for password input and environment detection), the risk is minimal. I would assign a score of **0.1** to reflect the potential sensitivity of handling passwords, but overall, it's very low.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, safe utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The existing scores are appropriate, with the possible slight increase in the overall risk score to 0.1 to acknowledge the handling of sensitive data.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
