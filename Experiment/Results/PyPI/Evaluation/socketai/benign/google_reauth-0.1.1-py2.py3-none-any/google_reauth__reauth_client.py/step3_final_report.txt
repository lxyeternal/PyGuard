  "purpose": "Client library for interacting with Google's Reauth HTTP API, handling challenges and token refreshes.",
  "sources": "HTTP request functions, input parameters such as access tokens, challenge IDs, and client inputs.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests sending tokens, challenge responses, and refresh tokens to external API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input data (tokens, challenge responses) flow into HTTP request bodies, which are sent to external API endpoints; responses are parsed and errors handled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected. Code follows standard OAuth2 patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client implementing standard OAuth2 and reauth interactions. It handles sensitive data properly, with error handling and no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The data flows are typical for such clients, and the code structure is clear and well-organized.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure client for Google's reauth API, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to handling sensitive tokens in a standard manner. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
