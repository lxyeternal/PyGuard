  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency, correctness, and appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**\n- Static analysis suggests benign code with no malicious patterns.\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Review:**\n- The report states no suspicious activity or obfuscation, which aligns with the scores.\n- The confidence is high (0.8), which seems justified given the static analysis.\n- Malware score is 0, consistent with the conclusion.\n- Security risk is low (0.2), which is reasonable given the benign assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**\n- No actual code provided; assessment is based on general considerations.\n- Confidence: 0.2\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Review:**\n- Given the lack of code, the low confidence (0.2) is justified.\n- Malware remains at 0, as no code is available to suggest malicious activity.\n- Security risk is also low, consistent with the inability to identify issues without code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable, but perhaps the security risk could be set to 0, as no code or activity is present. However, given the cautious approach, 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**\n- No code content; assessment based on absence of code.\n- Confidence: 0.2\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Review:**\n- Very limited data; the low confidence and zero scores for malware and risk are appropriate.\n- The security risk could arguably be 0, but 0.2 is acceptable to maintain a cautious stance.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**\n- Minimal code, no suspicious activity, benign assessment.\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Review:**\n- The code is minimal and benign, matching the scores.\n- The confidence is high, justified by the straightforward analysis.\n- Malware and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**\n- No code content; assessment based on description.\n- Confidence: 0.3\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Review:**\n- The low confidence reflects limited data.\n- Malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of code.\n- Security risk is low, consistent with the benign description.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n- The scores for malware are all zero, which is consistent with the assessments.\n- The obfuscated scores are all zero, matching the lack of suspicious code.\n- Security risk scores are generally low, reflecting cautious but benign assessments.\n- Confidence levels are appropriately set based on the amount of information.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- For reports with no code (2, 3, 5), consider setting the security risk to 0 to reflect certainty in benignity, but keeping a small buffer (0.2) is acceptable.\n- For reports with some code (1, 4), the high confidence and zero malware scores are justified.\n- The overall scoring aligns well with the static analysis summaries.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity in any report)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, given the benign assessments and lack of suspicious activity)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe current scores are reasonable and consistent with the reports' content. No significant adjustments are necessary.",
