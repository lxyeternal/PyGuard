  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the scores, and the overall consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report states the code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity, based on static analysis. The confidence is 0.8, malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Given that the report is based solely on static analysis and no code snippets are provided, the conclusion seems reasonable. The low malware and obfuscated scores align with the lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The security risk is low (0.2), which is consistent with the benign analysis. The confidence is high (0.8), which seems justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report indicates limited information, with no concrete anomalies, and a low confidence (0.2). Malware score is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Without code, the cautious approach is appropriate. The low confidence and malware score are justified.\n\n- **Potential Issue:** The report emphasizes checking for secrets or suspicious network addresses, but no code is available. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report notes the absence of code, leading to an inability to assess specifics. Malware score is 0, confidence is 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** This cautious stance is appropriate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code appears benign, minimalistic, with no suspicious patterns. Confidence is high (0.8), malware score 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the limited code content. The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, no code content is provided, and no suspicious activity is detected. Confidence is 0.3, malware 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The cautious approach is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Observations & Final Evaluation\n\n- **Code Presence & Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code snippets are either minimal, absent, or non-informative. No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns is detected.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:** The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. Obfuscated scores are zero, matching the reports' assessments.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** The security risk scores are generally low (0.2 or 0.3), aligning with the static, benign assessments.\n\n- **Potential Overestimation:** The only point to consider is the confidence levels. For reports with no code, the confidence is low (0.2-0.3), which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0, as no malicious activity or code is observed.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk given the lack of code or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nAll reports are consistent with the evidence (or lack thereof). The cautious approach due to missing code is appropriate, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThis indicates a low or negligible security concern based on the static analysis provided.",
