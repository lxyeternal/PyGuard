{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, possibly related to package setup or configuration.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, user inputs, and potentially external modules or package data during import.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network operations, file system access, or execution of dynamic code if present, as well as any data transmitted over network connections or written to disk.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network calls, file writes, or dynamic executions, depending on specific code paths.",
  "anomalies": "No clear anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are detected. The code structure appears standard; no unusual variable names or functions are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python module, potentially part of a package, with typical imports and functions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration, are evident. The absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code suggests it is benign. However, without executing or inspecting any external or dynamic parts, certainty is limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static code review, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems normal, with no malicious intent detected. Nonetheless, the review is limited to static analysis, and dynamic behavior cannot be fully assessed.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
