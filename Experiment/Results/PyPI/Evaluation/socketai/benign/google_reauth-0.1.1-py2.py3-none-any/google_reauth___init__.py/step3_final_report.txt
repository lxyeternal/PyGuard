{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module with data processing or utility functions, with no explicit malicious intent observed.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data, possibly from function parameters or external files, but no specific input sources are identified as suspicious.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs, network connections, or file writes, but no suspicious or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks; no malicious source-to-sink paths are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious variable names, or unusual code patterns are observed; code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "Static analysis indicates benign code with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The confidence level is high (0.8) due to the straightforward nature of the code. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious network activity are detected. The absence of code snippets limits dynamic assessment, but the static review supports a benign conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely safe with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) and malware score (0) are appropriate given the static analysis. No further action is necessary unless new code or evidence emerges.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
