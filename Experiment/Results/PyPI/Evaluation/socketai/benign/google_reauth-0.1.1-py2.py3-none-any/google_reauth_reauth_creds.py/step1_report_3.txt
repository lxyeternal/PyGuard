  "purpose": "Extend OAuth2Credentials to support reauthentication and rapt tokens, enabling token refresh and JSON serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "JSON data input in from_json method, data attributes during object creation and refresh.",
  "sinks": "Token data updates (access_token, refresh_token, token_expiry, rapt_token), JSON serialization/deserialization, HTTP request handling for token refresh.",
  "flows": "from_json parses JSON to initialize credentials; _do_refresh_request makes HTTP request to refresh tokens; _update updates internal token state from response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages OAuth2 credentials with added support for reauthentication via rapt tokens. It reads data from JSON, performs token refresh via HTTP request, and updates internal state accordingly. No embedded or obfuscated malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks identified. The HTTP request function is standard for token refresh operations, and no suspicious external domain or system access is observed. The code maintains proper security practices, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of OAuth2 credential handling extended with reauth support. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks beyond typical OAuth2 token management. The overall security risk is minimal.",
