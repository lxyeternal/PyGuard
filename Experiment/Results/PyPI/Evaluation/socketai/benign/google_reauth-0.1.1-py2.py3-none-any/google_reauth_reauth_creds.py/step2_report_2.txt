  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Extends OAuth2Credentials with reauth support.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard JSON parsing, token refresh via HTTP.\n- Anomalies: None suspicious, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Typical OAuth2 extension, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, standard code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the analysis; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar extension with reauth and rapt tokens.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard OAuth2 token handling, HTTP requests.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Analysis: Standard OAuth2 flow with added reauth support.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Extension with reauth and rapt tokens.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard token refresh logic.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious activity.\n- Analysis: Typical OAuth2 credential management.\n- Conclusion: No indicators of malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Adds reauth support.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard token handling.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Legitimate extension, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: No malware.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar extension.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard OAuth2 token refresh.\n- Anomalies: None suspicious.\n- Analysis: Typical OAuth2 credential management.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Presence:** All reports describe the same or similar code, which is a legitimate OAuth2 credential extension with reauth support.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign malware=0, which is justified given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports show obfuscated=0, consistent with the clean code description.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk score of 0.2 across all reports seems reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern since the code handles credentials securely and does not perform any suspicious activity.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard OAuth2 credential extension with added reauth features.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present.\n- HTTP requests are standard for token refresh workflows.\n- The code interacts with external modules in a typical manner.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to handling sensitive data and network requests, but nothing suspicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.
