  "purpose": "Extension of OAuth2Credentials with reauth support, handling token serialization, refresh, and optional rapt tokens.",
  "sources": "JSON data deserialization, HTTP request in _do_refresh_request(), token storage via self.store.locked_put().",
  "sinks": "HTTP request content transmission, token storage, JSON parsing of token data.",
  "flows": "JSON data -> internal data structures -> HTTP request for token refresh -> token update and storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OAuth2 credential management with added reauth features. It deserializes JSON data, manages token expiry, refreshes tokens via HTTP requests, and updates internal state accordingly. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of external modules appears standard. The security practices align with typical OAuth2 workflows, and no insecure patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate extension of OAuth2Credentials with reauth support, exhibiting no malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
