  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code extends OAuth2Credentials with reauth support, reading JSON data for token info, and making HTTP requests for token refresh.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** HTTP request in _do_refresh_request() potentially transmits sensitive token data; JSON parsing could handle untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The code uses standard OAuth2 practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, standard OAuth2 extension, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — low, given standard practices.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing token refresh and reauth, with no suspicious behavior or anomalies.  \n- The analysis confirms standard OAuth2 practices, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on extension with reauth and rapt tokens, standard JSON handling, and token refresh flows.\n- No signs of malicious code or suspicious network activity.\n- The analysis indicates standard OAuth2 flows with added reauth support.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar purpose: extend OAuth2Credentials with reauth, manage tokens via JSON and HTTP.\n- No suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- Standard OAuth2 practices, no backdoors or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent with the report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Again, a standard extension with reauth support, token refresh, JSON serialization.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious network behavior.\n- The analysis confirms legitimacy.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports confirm standard, legitimate OAuth2 credential management with reauth extensions.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is low, reflecting typical OAuth2 handling with minimal additional risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nAll reports consistently describe code that manages OAuth2 tokens, adds reauth support, and performs token refreshes via standard HTTP requests. No suspicious or malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no backdoors are evident. The low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
