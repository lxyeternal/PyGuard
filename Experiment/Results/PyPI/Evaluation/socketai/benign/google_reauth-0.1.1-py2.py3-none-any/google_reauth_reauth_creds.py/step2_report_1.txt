  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Extends OAuth2Credentials with reauth support.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard JSON parsing, token refresh via HTTP, token storage.\n- Anomalies: None suspicious.\n- Analysis: The code performs standard OAuth2 credential management with added reauth tokens. No malicious activity or hardcoded secrets.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, no malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar extension with reauth and rapt tokens.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard OAuth2 token handling, HTTP refresh.\n- Anomalies: None suspicious.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Standard, legitimate extension.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same extension with reauth support.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Typical OAuth2 token parsing and refresh.\n- Anomalies: None suspicious.\n- Analysis: No malicious indicators; standard OAuth2 flow.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, no malware.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Adds reauth to OAuth2Credentials.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard token management.\n- Anomalies: None suspicious.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate OAuth2 extension.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Typical OAuth2 token handling.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected.\n- **Scores for malware:** All zero, consistent with analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting the potential security impact of handling tokens and HTTP requests, but these are standard for OAuth2 credential management.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, typical for OAuth2 credential code handling)\n\n**Note:** The only scenario where a higher risk score might be justified is if the code were handling secrets insecurely or had backdoors, but no such issues are evident here.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's functionality.",
