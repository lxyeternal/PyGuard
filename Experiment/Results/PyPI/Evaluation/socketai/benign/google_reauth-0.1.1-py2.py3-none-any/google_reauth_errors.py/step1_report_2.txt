{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes related to reauthentication errors for use within a larger system handling authentication workflows.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code only defines exception classes and does not contain runtime data flows, input handling, or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes no suspicious or unusual behaviors; all classes serve straightforward exception handling purposes. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. No obfuscated or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, with clear, standard inheritance from Exception. The constructor implementations format messages and set optional status attributes. There are no external calls, data processing, or code execution. The license header is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be standard, benign code defining error classes for reauthentication processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for handling reauthentication errors. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code serves a legitimate purpose within an authentication framework and does not introduce any security concerns.",
