{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling reauthentication errors in an authentication system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class constructors set messages and optional attributes based on parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external calls or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiations with messages and optional status or error info; no data flow beyond object creation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward Python exception class definitions related to reauthentication errors. It includes a license header, class inheritance from Exception, message formatting, and optional attributes for error details. There are no external inputs, network interactions, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, standard, and serves a legitimate purpose. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for reauthentication errors. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. The reports accurately assess the code's safety, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
