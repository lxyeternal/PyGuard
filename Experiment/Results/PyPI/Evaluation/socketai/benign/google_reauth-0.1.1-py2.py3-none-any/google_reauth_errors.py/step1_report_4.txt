  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various reauthentication errors in an authentication system.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data reads). The code only defines classes and constructors.",
  "sinks": "None (no data sinks, output, or external communication).",
  "flows": "Not applicable (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling without any suspicious logic or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, each representing specific authentication errors. The constructors initialize exception messages, sometimes including parameters like api_error, message, or status. There is no evidence of data leaks, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity. The structure and content are standard for exception class definitions. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of error handling for an authentication module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions for reauthentication error handling, with no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks present. It functions solely as a part of an error management system without external communication or data manipulation.",
