  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for reauthentication errors.\n- They consistently note that the code is straightforward, with no external data handling, network calls, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The code is standard Python exception class definitions, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n**Confirmed Issues:**\n- The code matches the description: it only defines exception classes with messages and optional attributes.\n- No malicious code, data leaks, or external interactions are present.\n- The code appears benign and serves a legitimate purpose within an authentication framework.\n\n**Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code and do not overstate security concerns.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear class definitions.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no security risk.\n\n**Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they rely on code analysis rather than speculation.\n- The detailed error messages could, in some contexts, aid attackers if they leak sensitive info, but here they are generic and related to error handling, not sensitive data.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for reauthentication error handling. It poses no security or malware concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and thorough. Their scoring aligns with the code's content. No further action required.",
