  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports conclude that the code consists solely of straightforward custom exception class definitions for reauthentication errors.\n- No external data handling, network communication, or malicious behavior is observed.\n- The code adheres to standard Python exception practices.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic is present.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk as 0.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code matches the description: it defines exception classes with messages and optional attributes.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The license header is standard and does not raise concerns.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The absence of data flow, external inputs, or outputs aligns with the low risk scores.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are noted.\n\n**Score evaluation:**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, matching the straightforward class definitions.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The detailed reasoning in the reports supports the conclusion that this code poses no security risk.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security issues or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves a legitimate purpose within an authentication system.",
