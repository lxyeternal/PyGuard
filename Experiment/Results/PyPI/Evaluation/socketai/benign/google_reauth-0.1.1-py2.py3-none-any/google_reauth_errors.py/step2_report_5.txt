  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes related to reauthentication errors.\n   - All classes inherit from `Exception` or a subclass, with constructors that format messages and set optional attributes like `status` or `api_error`.\n   - There are no data inputs, external network calls, dynamic code execution, or other runtime behaviors.\n   - The license header is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n   - The code is straightforward, focused solely on error handling.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or tokens.\n   - No external data handling, network communication, or data leaks.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or backdoors.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent; the code appears to be a standard error class module.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Correctly assigned as 0. The code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly assigned as 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Any Logical or Reasoning Flaws?**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they recognize the code as benign, standard, and without security issues.\n   - No overestimations or underestimations are evident.\n   - The detailed error messages could be useful for debugging but do not pose security risks.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly assume the code is solely exception class definitions with no malicious elements.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or exploits, which is accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for reauthentication errors.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes needed; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is secure, clear, and free of malicious behavior.",
