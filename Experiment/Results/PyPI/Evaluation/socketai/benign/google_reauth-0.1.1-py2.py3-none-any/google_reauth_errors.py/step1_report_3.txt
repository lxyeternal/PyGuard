  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling reauthentication errors in a system that interacts with OAuth tokens and identity providers.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; only class definitions and exception initializations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing; only raising and handling exceptions.",
  "flows": "N/A — No data flow from source to sink; the code primarily defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behaviors identified. The code consists solely of exception class definitions with messages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions related to reauthentication processes, including errors for token refresh failures, API errors, unattended reauth, failed reauth, and SAML login requirements. It does not include any input handling, data processing, or network communication. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code features. The code's structure and content are typical for exception definitions, and it does not pose security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely defining exception classes for reauthentication error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is a standard, benign module for managing specific error conditions.",
