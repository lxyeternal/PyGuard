  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code content and functionality**:\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes related to reauthentication errors.\n   - All classes inherit from Exception or a subclass, with constructors setting messages and optional attributes.\n   - No external input/output, network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The license header is standard and non-malicious.\n\n2. **Security implications**:\n   - The code is purely for error handling; it does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - The detailed error messages aid debugging but do not pose security risks themselves.\n\n3. **Malware, obfuscation, and risk scores**:\n   - All reports assign malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0, and security risk = 0.\n   - Given the nature of the code, these assessments are accurate.\n\n4. **Potential issues or concerns**:\n   - The code is straightforward, with no suspicious logic or malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is standard exception class definitions.\n   - The reports are consistent in their evaluation, and their scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign, standard, and serves a clear purpose in error handling.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The high confidence and zero scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Security risk score**: 0\n\nThese align with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Note**: No changes needed; the reports are accurate and consistent.",
