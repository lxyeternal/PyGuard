  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various reauthentication errors in a system.",
  "sources": "None; this code defines classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data processing or external data outputs, no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow occurs in this code, as it solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be straightforward class definitions with standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes related to reauthentication errors, including refresh errors, API errors, and login requirements. All classes inherit from Exception or a subclass, and only include message formatting and attribute assignment. No input, output, or data processing occurs. No suspicious or malicious code, data leakage, or unusual behavior is present. No code injection, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The code is standard and maintains clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and standard for error handling in Python. No malicious behavior, security concerns, or obfuscation are detected.",
