{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various reauthentication errors in an authentication system.",
  "sources": "No external input reading; all data originates from internal exception handling and error messages.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink since there are no inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward exception class definitions with no suspicious or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for handling specific reauthentication errors, each initialized with relevant messages and optional status codes. It adheres to standard Python exception practices, with no dynamic code execution, external network calls, or suspicious logic. The presence of detailed error messages could aid in debugging but does not pose a security risk itself. Overall, the code appears benign and focused on error handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for reauthentication errors, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no external data handling, network operations, or obfuscated components.",
