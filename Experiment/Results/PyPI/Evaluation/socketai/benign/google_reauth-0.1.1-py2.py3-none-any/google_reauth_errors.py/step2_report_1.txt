  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for reauthentication errors.\n- No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code appears to be standard, straightforward, and benign.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: class definitions inheriting from Exception, with message formatting and optional attributes.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are evident.\n- The purpose is clear: error handling within an authentication system.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The detailed messages in exceptions are standard and do not pose security concerns.\n\n**Justification for scores:**\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n- The high confidence scores are justified given the clear, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain as is.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The exception classes serve their purpose without introducing any vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.",
