  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding UTF-8 strings to and from hexadecimal representation.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through function parameters, specifically the 'text' argument in encode_hexstr and decode_hexstr.",
  "sinks": "The functions process data internally and return string outputs; no external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encode to bytes -> convert to hex string -> return; reverse flow for decode.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two utility functions that encode a UTF-8 string into its hexadecimal representation and decode a hex string back into a UTF-8 string. It uses the 'binascii' library, which is standard for such conversions. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or data leaks. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The code is simple and well-documented, including Chinese comments.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic encoding/decoding operations without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate for string encoding utilities.",
