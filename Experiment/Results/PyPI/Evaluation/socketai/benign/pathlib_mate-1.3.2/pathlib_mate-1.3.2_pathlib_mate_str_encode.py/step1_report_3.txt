  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding UTF-8 strings to and from hexadecimal representation.",
  "sources": "Input data from function arguments (`text` parameter in both functions).",
  "sinks": "Returns encoded or decoded string; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encode/decode -> output string; no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Code appears straightforward, with proper use of standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for converting UTF-8 strings to hex and vice versa, using the standard `binascii` library. There are no hardcoded secrets, environment variable use, or external system calls. No input validation issues or injection points are present. The functions perform simple encoding and decoding tasks without side effects or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for string encoding. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
