  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in encode_hexstr and decode_hexstr functions.",
  "sinks": "None; functions process data internally without external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encode_utf8 -> binascii.b2a_hex -> hex string (encode_hexstr); hex string -> decode_hexstr -> binascii.a2b_hex -> UTF-8 string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with standard library functions, well-documented, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two simple utility functions for string encoding/decoding using Python's binascii. It handles input strings and returns transformed strings without external dependencies, network, or file operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The functions are correctly implemented, and the documentation is clear, including Chinese comments. All assessments assign zero malware and security risk scores, with high confidence, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility module for string encoding and decoding. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
