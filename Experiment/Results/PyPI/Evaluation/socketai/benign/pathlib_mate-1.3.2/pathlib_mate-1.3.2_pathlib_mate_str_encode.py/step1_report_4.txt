  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding UTF-8 strings to and from hexadecimal representation.",
  "sources": "The functions read input strings provided as arguments to encode_hexstr and decode_hexstr.",
  "sinks": "The functions output hex-encoded or decoded strings; no untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings are encoded or decoded and then returned; no external data flow or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple utility functions that convert UTF-8 strings to hexadecimal and vice versa using Python's binascii module. The functions accept string input, encode/decode it, and return the result. There are no external data inputs such as network calls, file reads, or environment variable accesses. The implementation is standard, clear, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious patterns. The documentation includes Chinese comments, but this does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module for string encoding and decoding, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
