  "purpose": "Utility functions for string encoding and decoding between UTF-8 and hexadecimal representations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'text' in encode_hexstr and decode_hexstr functions.",
  "targets": "Returns encoded/decoded string; no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encode_hexstr/decode_hexstr -> output string; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious patterns, straightforward encoding/decoding functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic utility functions to convert strings to and from hexadecimal format using the binascii module. It only processes input strings and returns transformed strings without external data exchange, network operations, or file handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a benign utility module with proper encoding/decoding logic. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for string encoding and decoding. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks present.",
