  "purpose": "Filesystem utility functions including directory fingerprinting, analysis, mirroring, script execution, code formatting, and atomic file operations.",
  "sources": "User parameters (e.g., 'dst', 'py_exe'), filesystem state, external script files.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen calls for executing scripts, file read/write operations, directory creation.",
  "flows": "External inputs influence subprocess commands and filesystem modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.Popen with string formatting without input sanitization, potential command injection risk; creation of empty files during mirror operation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard filesystem utilities with no embedded malicious payloads or obfuscation. The main security concern is the execution of external scripts via subprocess without validation, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. No backdoors or sabotage are present. The directory mirroring creates empty files, which is benign. The code's structure is straightforward and readable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate filesystem utility library with potential risks associated with executing untrusted scripts via subprocess. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. Proper input validation is recommended to mitigate command injection risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting the inherent risk of subprocess execution without validation.",
