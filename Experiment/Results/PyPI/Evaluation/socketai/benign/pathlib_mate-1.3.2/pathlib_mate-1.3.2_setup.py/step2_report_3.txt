  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup script, reading package metadata and external files, with no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Key points:** No code obfuscation, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, exception handling is broad but benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence, as the analysis aligns with the code.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion appears accurate. The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the standard nature of the script, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Key points:** No network activity, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, exception handling is broad but not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, perhaps due to the broad exception handling or file reads, but not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high, but slightly less than Report 1 due to cautious wording.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard, and no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing the lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Key points:** No network calls, no code injection, exception handling is broad but benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — negligible, perhaps due to the silent exception handling.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; the code is typical for setup purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature, no malicious behavior.\n- **Key points:** No code injection, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no issues detected.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion, standard setup script.\n- **Key points:** No untrusted input processing, no network activity, straightforward file reads.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a standard setup script, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any malicious indicators, I would assign a **risk score of 0**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code reads package metadata, description files, and dependencies from static files and package attributes.\n- No network activity, code injection, or dynamic execution.\n- Exception handling is broad but typical for setup scripts.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- All data flows are from trusted sources (local files, package attributes).\n\n**Therefore, my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis setup script is a standard, benign package configuration script with no malicious intent or security issues.",
