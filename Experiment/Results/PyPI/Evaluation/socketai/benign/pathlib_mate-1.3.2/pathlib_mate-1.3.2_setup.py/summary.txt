  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero. The broad exception handling is typical but should ideally be logged for debugging; it does not compromise security."
