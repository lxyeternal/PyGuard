{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to generate cryptographic hashes for text and files using various hash algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from text strings and file paths; reading file contents from disk.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no use of untrusted data directly influencing sensitive operations beyond file reading.",
  "flows": "Text data flows from input parameter to hash update; file content flows from disk to hash update.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Functions are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code offers utility functions for hashing text and files with different algorithms (MD5, SHA256, SHA512). Input data (text and file contents) are read and hashed without modification or suspicious behavior. File reading is done safely with proper chunking and error handling. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. No network communication or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The code appears to be legitimate hashing utilities, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard hashing functions for text and files with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, clear, and safe for typical use.",
