  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides functions for hashing strings (`get_text_fingerprint`) and files (`get_file_fingerprint`, with specific wrappers for MD5, SHA256, SHA512).\n- Performs input validation on chunk sizes and nbytes.\n- Reads files in chunks or entirely, depending on parameters.\n- Uses standard hashlib functions.\n- No network activity, no obfuscation, no secrets, no suspicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports consistently state that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign. Based on the code, there are no hidden backdoors, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The code matches the descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- **Input validation:**  \n  The code raises an error if `nbytes < 0` or `chunk_size < 1`, which is correct.  \n  **Minor note:** The error message for `nbytes < 0` says \"chunk_size cannot smaller than 0,\" which is a mistake; it should refer to `nbytes`. But this is a trivial typo and does not impact security.\n\n- **Functionality correctness:**  \n  The logic for reading files in chunks and handling `nbytes` appears correct. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n- **Security considerations:**  \n  No use of untrusted data in unsafe ways; no external network calls.\n\n### Are the scores reasonable?\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 in report 1; others 0, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code is a standard hashing utility, with no malicious intent.  \n- No evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious payloads.  \n- The minimal risk score (0.1) in report 1 might be slightly conservative; perhaps 0.0 would be more accurate, but it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Overall:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, well-implemented, and suitable for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code review.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe hashing utility with no malicious or obfuscated components. The scoring should reflect this, with all scores at zero or near-zero.",
