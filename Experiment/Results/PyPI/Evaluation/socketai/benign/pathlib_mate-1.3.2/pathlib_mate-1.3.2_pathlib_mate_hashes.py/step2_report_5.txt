  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scoring, and the logical consistency.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code provides functions for hashing strings and files using MD5, SHA256, and SHA512.\n- It performs input validation on chunk sizes and nbytes.\n- Files are read in chunks, with optional partial hashing.\n- No network operations, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The functions are straightforward and rely solely on Python's hashlib and standard file I/O.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code appears correct, secure, and benign.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Error message in `get_file_fingerprint`:** The error message for `nbytes < 0` says `\"chunk_size cannot smaller than 0\"`, which is incorrect; it should refer to `nbytes`. This is a minor mistake but does not impact security or functionality significantly.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward implementation.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0, which is reasonable given the code's purpose. Hashing utilities are generally low risk unless misused.\n\n### Potential issues with the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: the code is standard, safe, and benign.\n- The slight discrepancy in the error message string in `get_file_fingerprint` is minor and doesn't warrant a higher risk score.\n- No report suggests any malicious intent or vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The **risk scores** assigned are appropriate and not overstated.\n- The **malware score** should remain at 0.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at 0.\n- The **security risk** can remain very low, around 0.1 or even 0, since the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, typical for utility code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard hashing utility with no security issues or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The only minor issue is the incorrect error message string, which does not impact security but could be corrected for clarity.",
