{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for hashing strings and files using MD5, SHA256, and SHA512 algorithms with input validation and chunked reading.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings in get_text_fingerprint; reads file data in get_file_fingerprint, md5file, sha256file, sha512file functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; file reading from provided paths, no network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings or files) flows into hash functions; file data is read in chunks and fed into hash objects; resulting hash digest returned.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in error message: 'chunk_size cannot smaller than 0' should refer to 'nbytes'; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of hashing utilities, correctly validating inputs and reading files in chunks. It uses standard hashlib functions without obfuscation or malicious patterns. No network activity, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The only minor issue is the misleading error message for nbytes < 0, which does not impact security or functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for hashing files and strings. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its safe nature.",
