{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to generate cryptographic hash fingerprints of text and files, supporting multiple hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA256, SHA512).",
  "sources": "Reads input data from strings (in get_text_fingerprint) and files (in get_file_fingerprint and its callers).",
  "sinks": "Hash objects update data during hashing; no untrusted data output or network operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Input data (text or file content) flows into hash objects via update() method, producing digest outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. No suspicious network activity or malicious code behavior. No use of unsafe functions or environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for creating cryptographic hashes of text and files, with support for different algorithms. It reads files in chunks, allowing partial hashing via nbytes. Error handling for invalid chunk sizes is present. No indications of malicious intent or malicious payloads. The code is well-structured, using standard libraries, and does not perform any network communication or system modifications. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for hashing data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for use in checksum or integrity verification tasks.",
