{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for generating hash fingerprints of text strings and files using various hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA256, SHA512).",
  "sources": "Reading input data from text parameters, and reading files from specified absolute paths.",
  "sinks": "Hash functions that process input data; no data is sent elsewhere or leaked outside the functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (text or files) flows into hash functions via encode or file read operations, resulting in hash digests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The functions are standard cryptographic hashing routines.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for creating hash fingerprints of text and files. It includes safeguards against invalid input parameters, such as negative or zero chunk sizes. The functions read file contents either fully or partially based on parameters, then compute hash values using standard hashlib functions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or covert operations. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of file and text hashing. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for generating cryptographic hashes of files or strings, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions as a typical hashing utility module.",
