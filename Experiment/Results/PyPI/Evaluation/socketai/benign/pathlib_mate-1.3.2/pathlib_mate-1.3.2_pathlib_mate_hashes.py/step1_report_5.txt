{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for generating hash fingerprints of text strings and files using various hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA256, SHA512).",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: 'text' for get_text_fingerprint, and file paths ('abspath') for file fingerprint functions.",
  "sinks": "Hashing functions write data to hash objects, but do not perform unsafe operations; no sinks are associated with untrusted data execution.",
  "flows": "Input data (text or file content) flows into hash object updates, resulting in a hash digest; no data is sent externally or used insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior are detected. The code performs standard hashing operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard hashing routines with input validation for chunk sizes and nbytes. It reads files in chunks for efficiency. No dynamic execution or obfuscation techniques are used. There are no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The functions serve typical checksum purposes without external network activity or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward utility for generating file and text hashes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is standard and safe.",
