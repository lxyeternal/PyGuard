  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard filesystem utility library with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal operational risk due to filesystem interactions. No modifications are necessary."
