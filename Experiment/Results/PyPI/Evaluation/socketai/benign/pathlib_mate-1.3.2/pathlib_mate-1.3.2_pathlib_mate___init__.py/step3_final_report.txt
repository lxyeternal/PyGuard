  "purpose": "Set package metadata and attempt to import classes/functions from a local 'api' module with error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .api module, reading version info and metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import attempts from .api module, with broad exception handling masking import errors.",
  "anomalies": "Broad try-except blocks that suppress ImportError and general Exception; silent failure handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py-like script defining metadata and attempting to import from a local module. The broad exception handling could hide import issues but does not involve malicious code, network activity, or data leaks. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The silent exception handling slightly elevates the risk score but remains benign in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The broad exception handling is a common pattern but could mask import failures. Scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk due to exception handling patterns.",
