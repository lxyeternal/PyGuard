  "purpose": "Define a version string and print it when executed directly.",
  "sources": "No external input; the code only defines a variable and checks the __name__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: __version__ is assigned, and if __name__ == '__main__', it prints __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version declaration and print statement, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores reflecting no malicious intent or security risks. The code's simplicity and clarity confirm that it poses no security threat. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, securityRisk: 0.0, confidence: 1.0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving solely to display a version string. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks present. All reports are accurate, and no improvements are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
