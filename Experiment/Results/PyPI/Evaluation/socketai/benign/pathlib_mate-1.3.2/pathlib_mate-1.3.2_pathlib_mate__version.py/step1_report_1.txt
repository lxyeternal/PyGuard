  "purpose": "Display the version number of the package when executed as a script",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ variable and the __name__ variable",

  "flows": "__name__ (when '__main__') -> print(__version__)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and conditionally prints it if the script is run directly. It contains no input handling, no external data sources, and no suspicious or malicious code. The structure is minimal and typical for version reporting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended solely for version display. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
