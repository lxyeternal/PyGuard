  "purpose": "The code defines a version string and prints it when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' is a source of data; the 'print' function outputs it.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs data to standard output, which is not inherently unsafe.",
  "flows": "The source '__version__' flows directly into the sink 'print'.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs. It is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script sets a version string and, when run as the main module, prints this version. No input is taken from external sources, no data is sent over networks, and there are no suspicious behaviors or malicious code. The structure is simple and standard for version reporting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic version display script with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
