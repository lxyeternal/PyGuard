  "purpose": "The code defines a version string and prints it if the script is executed directly.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs data to standard output.",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned to '__version__' and then printed if the script runs as main.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version variable and conditionally prints it when run as a script. There are no data inputs from external sources, no data leaks, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors. It is a minimal script primarily used for version display, with no indication of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, simply defining and displaying a version string with no malicious intent or security risks.",
