  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting package info or version",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), otherwise print_info()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static CLI script that reads command-line arguments and prints predefined information. It uses only standard library functions, with no external dependencies, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The logic is simple, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0 or very close) are consistent with the code's nature. The only minor discrepancy is a report assigning a security risk score of 0.1, which should be adjusted to 0 for consistency, given the benign static nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious or security risks. The reports are accurate, with a slight overestimation of security risk in one case. The overall assessment should assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0.",
