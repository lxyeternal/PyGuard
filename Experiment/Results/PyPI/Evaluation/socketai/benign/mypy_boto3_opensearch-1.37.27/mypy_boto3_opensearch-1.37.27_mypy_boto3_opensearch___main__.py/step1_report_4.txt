  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the boto3 OpenSearchService stub package, including version and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout",
  "flows": "User input (--version) triggers print_version, which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info outputs package details",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or unusual code, no external network calls or data exfiltration, straightforward use of standard libraries",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that responds to a '--version' argument by printing version info or prints package details otherwise. It imports only sys, uses standard output, and contains no external dependencies, network calls, or suspicious code patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. The functions are straightforward with clear intent. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility intended for informational purposes. It performs no malicious actions, does not handle untrusted data insecurely, and contains no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
