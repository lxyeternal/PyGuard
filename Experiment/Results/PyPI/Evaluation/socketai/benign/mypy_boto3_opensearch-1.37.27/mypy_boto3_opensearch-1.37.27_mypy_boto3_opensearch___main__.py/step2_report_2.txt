  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n- It reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) and writes to `sys.stdout`.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The logic is straightforward and static.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code matches the description in all reports. No vulnerabilities, malware, or anomalies are present.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the script as benign, straightforward, and safe.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Most reports assign 0.0 or 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or data handling, a score of 0.0 is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely informational, with no network activity, no handling of sensitive data, and no obfuscation, the risk score should remain at **0.0**.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis. This is reasonable; no suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0.0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.0**  \n\nThe scores given in the reports are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a minimal, safe CLI utility.\n- No hidden or malicious logic.\n- The static nature and lack of external dependencies make it inherently safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no security issues or malware risks. The scores are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
