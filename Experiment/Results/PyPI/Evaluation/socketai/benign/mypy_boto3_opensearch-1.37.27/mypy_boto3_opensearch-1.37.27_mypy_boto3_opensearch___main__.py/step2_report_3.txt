  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a minimal CLI utility.\n- It responds to `--version` argument by printing a static version string.\n- Otherwise, it prints static package info.\n- It uses only standard library functions (`sys.argv`, `sys.stdout.write`).\n- No external calls, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no secrets or credentials.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and purpose-specific.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or external network calls are present.\n- The logic is simple and safe.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent; no logical flaws are evident.\n- The security risk score is uniformly low, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- The only potential concern is the `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in report 3, which seems slightly high for such a benign script. It might be an overestimation unless considering the risk of accidental misuse, but generally, it's acceptable.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscation:\n- All reports correctly assign `malware` and `obfuscated` scores as 0.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0, with one at 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Potential Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- No claims in the reports are based on unwarranted assumptions; all are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.\n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n**Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1 — Minimal risk, mostly informational.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a simple, safe CLI utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The overall security posture of this script is very high; it can be considered safe for deployment.",
