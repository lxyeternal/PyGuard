  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The script is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line argument '--version'.\n   - It uses only standard library modules (`sys`) and performs straightforward read/write operations.\n   - No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or data processing beyond printing static strings.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the script is a simple informational CLI tool.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or external dependencies are present.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.0 or 0.1, with the minimal risk being just the basic CLI operation, which is acceptable.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n   - The only point to consider is the small \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1 in report 3, which seems slightly elevated given the benign code. Since the code is static and safe, this should be 0.0 for consistency.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Final Scores:**\n   - **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n   - **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0.0          | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.0          | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.             |\n| Security Risk    | 0.0          | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or risky operations.       |\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, safe CLI utility for displaying static package info. The reports are consistent and accurate. The only minor note is the slightly elevated security risk score in one report, which should be adjusted to 0.0 for consistency.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nUpdate the \"securityRisk\" score in report 3 from 0.1 to 0.0 to align with the overall benign assessment. The malware and obfuscated scores are correct as-is.",
