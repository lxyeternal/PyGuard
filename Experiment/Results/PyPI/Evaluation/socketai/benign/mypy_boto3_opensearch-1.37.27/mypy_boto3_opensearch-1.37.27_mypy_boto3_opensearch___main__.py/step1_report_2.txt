  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational outputs about boto3 OpenSearchService typings and version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Writes information to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "User provides '--version' argument, triggering print_version(), otherwise prints package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No unusual code behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines three functions: print_info(), print_version(), and main(). The print_info() function outputs static package metadata; print_version() outputs a static version number. The main() function checks for '--version' in sys.argv and conditionally calls print_version() or print_info(). The script's logic is straightforward and static, with no external input processing beyond command-line arguments. There are no code injections, data leaks, or suspicious network activity, and no use of environment variables or unsafe code constructs. The code is clean, well-structured, and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI utility designed to display package information. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use.",
