  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that checks for '--version' argument to display version info, otherwise prints package details. No external data fetching, network operations, or malicious code included. No use of untrusted inputs beyond simple argument check, which is benign. No signs of malicious or maliciously intended behavior.",
