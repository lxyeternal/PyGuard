  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (writes output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (outputs package info and version details)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious external calls, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that responds to a '--version' argument by printing version information, or otherwise prints package details. It only performs read operations on sys.argv and writes to sys.stdout. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive data handling is present. No suspicious logic or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI script intended for informational purposes with no malicious behavior. It is safe and contains no malware or security risks.",
