  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing information about boto3 OpenSearchService typings and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output messages",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout, which is standard and safe; no external or untrusted data sources involved",
  "flows": "Command-line argument (source) checks for '--version', then calls print_version() or print_info(), both writing static information to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code only outputs static strings based on command-line input without executing untrusted code or external data",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles command-line arguments to display static package information or version. It uses standard library functions with no external dependencies or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The logic is straightforward and does not include obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs package information or version based on user input. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
