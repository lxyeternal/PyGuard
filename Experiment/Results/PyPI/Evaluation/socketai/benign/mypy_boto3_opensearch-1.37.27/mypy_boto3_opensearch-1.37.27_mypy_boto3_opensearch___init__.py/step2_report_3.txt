  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, and verify if the conclusions and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a simple module with documentation, imports, and an alias assignment. No untrusted data handling, no dynamic execution, no network calls, no obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** No malware, no security risks, and the copyright date being future-dated (2025) is likely a placeholder.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, primarily documentation and straightforward import/alias code. No suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No malware, no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a simple module with imports, alias, and documentation. No runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Findings:** No malware, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—imports, alias, documentation, no runtime or data processing.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with a note about the future-dated copyright.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation. The only anomaly is the date, which is not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The report assigns a slightly elevated security risk (0.1) due to the future-dated copyright, which is not a security concern but might be considered a placeholder or oversight.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score seems slightly high given the actual code content. It could reasonably be 0 unless the placeholder date hints at potential future issues, but not necessarily a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly zero, except report 5, which is marginally elevated due to the date anomaly. This is not a security concern but perhaps a placeholder or typo.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** Given the analysis, I would set all to 0, including report 5, because the only anomaly is the date, which does not constitute a security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Final note:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor date anomaly does not warrant a risk score above zero.",
