{
  "purpose": "Provide main interface for the OpenSearch service client, including documentation and exporting client classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules, code comments, and string documentation.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly module setup and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard import and export structure. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines imports from internal modules, assigns a class to a variable, and sets __all__ for exports. The documentation string includes a usage example but no actual execution or data handling. No external inputs or sensitive operations are present. No signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward interface module for the OpenSearch client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module providing an interface to OpenSearch service clients with standard structure and documentation. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
