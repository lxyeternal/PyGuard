  "purpose": "Provides a module interface for the OpenSearch service with documentation and class aliases.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, documentation comments, alias assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static setup with no dynamic execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright year (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static module setup with no dynamic or malicious code. It contains only import statements, documentation, and an alias assignment. The only unusual aspect is the future year in the copyright, which does not impact security or functionality. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor anomaly (future date) does not constitute a security concern. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
