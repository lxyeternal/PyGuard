  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scoring, and the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a simple module with documentation, import statements, and an alias. No data handling or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent. The future copyright date is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing documentation and straightforward imports. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a typical module setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no signs of malicious activity, just module setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a straightforward interface module with documentation and imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, but notes the future-dated copyright year (2025) as unusual.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** The report assigns a small security risk (0.1) due to the future date, which is not malicious but somewhat atypical. The malware score remains 0, and no obfuscation is detected.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is reasonable. The future date is not malicious but could be a typo or placeholder. The risk score of 0.1 reflects this minor anomaly without implying any threat.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign module with no malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The only minor point is the slightly elevated security risk (0.1) in report 5 due to the future date, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — code is straightforward and readable.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the consistent benign nature, I would assign a risk score of **0** for all, including report 5, since the only anomaly (future date) is not a security risk but a placeholder or typo.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are appropriate; no changes necessary.\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** All reports correctly reflect the benign nature of the code. The minor note about the future date in report 5 is justified but does not warrant an increased risk score. I would set all risk scores to **0** for consistency and accuracy.",
