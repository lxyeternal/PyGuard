{
  "purpose": "Provides main interface for OpenSearch service, including imports and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator); no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks, no untrusted data handling, no external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; mainly module setup and exports.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of copyright date set to 2025, which may be intentionally future-dated or placeholder; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module interface that imports specific classes and assigns a variable. It contains documentation, import statements, and exports. No user input handling, environment variable usage, or dynamic execution is present. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to malicious activity. The only potential concern is the future copyright year, which appears to be a placeholder or typo but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it contain suspicious logic or external communications.",
