  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-opensearch package, defining metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing setup from setuptools; static string data defining package info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data sinks or external network connections.",
  "flows": "Static data used to configure package installation; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports required modules, reads a local README.md for the description, and calls setup() with static metadata. No user input, network access, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are observed. The code adheres to common Python packaging practices, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides package metadata and dependencies.",
