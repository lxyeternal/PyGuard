  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard Python setup script (`setup.py`) for the package `mypy-boto3-opensearch`.\n   - The code reads a local `README.md` for the long description and calls `setuptools.setup()` with static metadata, dependencies, and URLs.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**:\n   - All reports uniformly state that no anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, adheres to common packaging patterns, and does not contain any code that could be malicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**:\n     - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**:\n     - All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**:\n     - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the script.\n\n4. **Assessment of the Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, no security risks.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not mention any external dependencies or hidden behaviors.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic operations, network calls, or data processing that could introduce risks.\n   - The only minor point is the `install_requires` line with a conditional dependency, but this is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the provided code and reports, there are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The code is a typical, well-formed setup script with no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
