{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the Python module 'mypy-boto3-opensearch' via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports from pathlib and setuptools; static metadata fields in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external inputs; all fields are statically defined or based on local files",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static setup configuration",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script that imports necessary modules, reads a local README file, and calls setup() with predefined metadata. There are no user inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. All data used is static or local, and there are no indications of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and standard for package distribution.",
