  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, network calls, or user inputs are present.\n- The code imports standard modules, reads a local README file, and calls `setuptools.setup()` with static metadata.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The overall assessment from all reports is that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description and appears correct for a setup script.\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** No security risks identified.\n\n### Scores consistency:\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are all 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (1.0), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score (0):** No security risk, no untrusted data, no external dependencies or code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**The code is a standard, well-formed setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.** The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No further security concerns or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**Conclusion:** The package setup script is safe, standard, and free of security issues.",
