  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python module 'mypy-boto3-opensearch'.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file; static metadata in setup() call; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external calls.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, conventional setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script utilizing setuptools. It imports standard modules, reads a local README for description, and calls setup() with fixed metadata. No user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code is present. The dependency specification is standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and adherence to common packaging practices indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals point to a safe, well-formed configuration.",
