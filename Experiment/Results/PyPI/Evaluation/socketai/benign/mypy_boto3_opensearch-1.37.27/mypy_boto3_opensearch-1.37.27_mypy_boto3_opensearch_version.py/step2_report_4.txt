  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, external data flows, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.\n   - The only notable aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or oversight but not a security concern.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No technical errors or flaws are evident in the code.\n   - The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; they consistently identify the code as benign.\n   - The only minor point is the future year, which is not a security issue but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), justified by the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all recognize the code as standard.\n   - The reports avoid speculation about malicious intent, which is correct.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are observed.\n\n**Overall Evaluation & My Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is a standard version declaration, common in Python packages.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year, which does not impact security but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n**Final scores I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code is benign, standard, and contains no security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are correct in their assessments.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- I agree with the overall conclusion that this code poses no security risk.",
