  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for version control.",
  "sources": "No external sources; the code assigns a fixed string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment without dynamic or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year '2025' is unusual but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward version string assignment with a comment. No input, output, dynamic code, or obfuscation present. All reports correctly identify it as benign. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security issues or malicious intent. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
