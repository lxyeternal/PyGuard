  "purpose": "Define and store the version information for the package.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '1.37.27' to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Assignment of a static string to __version__, with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution. The comment about 'source of truth for version' is typical documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of a version string, accompanied by a copyright comment. There are no inputs, outputs, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard version identifier commonly used in Python packages. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The simplicity and clarity suggest no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines a version string for a package with no malicious content or security concerns. It is a standard practice for package versioning.",
