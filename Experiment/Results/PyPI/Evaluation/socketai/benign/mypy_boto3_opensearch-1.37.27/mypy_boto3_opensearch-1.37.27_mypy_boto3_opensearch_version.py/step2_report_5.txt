  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and potential issues.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a copyright comment.\n- No inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external data handling.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious patterns.\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or inconsistency but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as a simple version string declaration with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zero or perfect (confidence 1).  \n- **Comments:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, consistent and correct.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate; no change needed.\n\n#### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Notes the future copyright year as a minor anomaly.\n- **Scores:** All zero or perfect; appropriate.\n- **Comments:** The future year does not pose a security risk, just a possible typo.\n\n#### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Correctly states the code is benign and standard.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate.\n\n#### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final considerations:\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed to be just a static string assignment.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscation:** Zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Zero, no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. The only minor note is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security or malicious concerns.",
