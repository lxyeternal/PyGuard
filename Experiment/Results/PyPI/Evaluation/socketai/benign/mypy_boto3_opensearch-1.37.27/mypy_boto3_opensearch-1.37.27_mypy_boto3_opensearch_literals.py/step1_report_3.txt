{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations using string literals for various AWS OpenSearch and other AWS service-related constants.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and conditional import of Literal; defines multiple Literal types as constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks, as the code solely defines type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward definition of string literal types. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. No obfuscated code or hidden payloads present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version >= 3.12, which is standard practice. It then defines a large set of type aliases as string literals representing AWS service names, statuses, configurations, and other enumerations. All definitions are static and serve as type annotations for a larger project, aimed at improving type safety and documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data leakage, are evident. The license and purpose comments are benign. The module solely serves as a constants/stubs definition for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type alias definitions file used for type checking and documentation, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
