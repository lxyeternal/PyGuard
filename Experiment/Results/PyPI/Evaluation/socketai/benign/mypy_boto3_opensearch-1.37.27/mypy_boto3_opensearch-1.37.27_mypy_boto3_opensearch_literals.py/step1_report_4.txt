{
  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for AWS OpenSearch service and other AWS SDK components to enable type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module to determine Python version; assignment of string literals to type aliases; no external data input or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows present; the code only defines type literals without executing any logic or data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward type alias definitions with conditional import for compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing sys and conditionally importing Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, which is standard practice for compatibility. It then defines an extensive list of string literal types assigned to type aliases, used for type checking in AWS SDK usage. No external inputs, network connections, or dynamic code execution are present. The structure is consistent, and the content is purely type annotations for AWS services and resources. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that provides type aliases for AWS service string literals. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data sources, and no suspicious logic. It is safe for use and appears to be solely for type safety and improved developer experience.",
