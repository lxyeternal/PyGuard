  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS service-related constants to facilitate type checking and validation in Python code using mypy.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for various AWS service types, status types, configuration options, resource identifiers, regions, and other constants; imported modules sys, typing, typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to security issues; code primarily defines static string literal types.",
  "flows": "N/A - static definitions without data flow or dynamic processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code includes extensive literal definitions and conditional import logic based on Python version. No malicious code or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script provides type annotations for various AWS-related literal types to support type checking in Python projects. It uses conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions, which is standard. There are no dynamic data inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The code consists solely of static literal definitions and a comprehensive list of constants. No signs of malicious intent, code injection, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining type literals for AWS services, with no malicious behavior or security issues. It serves as a type annotation helper for AWS SDK usage. The risk is minimal, and there are no indicators of malware or security threats.",
