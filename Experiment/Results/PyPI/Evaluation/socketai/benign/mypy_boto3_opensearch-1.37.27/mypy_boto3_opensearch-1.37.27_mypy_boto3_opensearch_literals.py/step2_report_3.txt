  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS service literals; reads sys.version_info for compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** None; purely static definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; static, benign code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It serves as a type hints utility module.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign, no issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; extensive literal definitions, compatibility handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** None; static constants.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; extensive constants, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type alias definitions for AWS constants, standard practice, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0, which is justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Clear, benign, and consistent. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for AWS services and constants; uses sys and conditional import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** None; static definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely static type annotations, no dynamic code, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0, justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, standard, and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports; large set of literal type aliases.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** None; static definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type alias definitions for AWS constants, compatible with multiple Python versions.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Benign, no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type literals for AWS OpenSearch and other services; uses sys.version_info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** None; static constants.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; no secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely declarative, static type alias definitions for AWS service constants, with standard compatibility handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk at 0, justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Completely benign, no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Python's `Literal`. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, network operations, or embedded secrets.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is accurate. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not observed in any report; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Scores Consistency:** The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the assessments in all reports. The code is a benign, static type alias module designed to improve type safety and documentation for AWS SDKs. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, purely defining constants for type annotations, with no security concerns.",
