{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations for AWS service literals using Python's Literal typing, facilitating static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static string literals defining AWS service names, statuses, regions, and other constants; conditional import based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions without data flow or external input/output.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; purely static type alias declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static Literal type aliases for various AWS constants, with a conditional import for compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic code, data processing, network calls, or embedded secrets are present. The extensive list of constants is typical for type hinting modules. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The purpose is purely to provide type safety and improve code clarity in type-checked projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module for AWS constants, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves its purpose effectively as a type annotation aid without introducing vulnerabilities.",
