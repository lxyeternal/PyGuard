  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported findings against the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS service literals; reads sys.version_info for compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or output; purely static definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; static constants, standard conditional import.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely for type safety.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static, benign, and serves as a type hinting utility. No malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; extensive literal definitions for AWS constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow; static definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; standard pattern of defining string literals for type checking.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with minimal security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. The risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for AWS OpenSearch and related constants; conditional import for compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic data or output.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Straightforward static type alias definitions; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe for use.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports; extensive literal type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns; standard static definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely for type annotations.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation is accurate; risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS OpenSearch; conditional import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely declarative.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is static, consisting solely of type alias definitions for AWS constants.\n- **Behavior:** No dynamic execution, no data flow, no network activity, no input/output processing.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.\n- **Security Risks:** Minimal to none; the code functions as a type hinting utility.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior or payloads present.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward static definitions with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk or vulnerability introduced by this code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, static collection of type alias definitions for AWS service constants, serving as a type safety and documentation aid. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the current scoring and analysis are accurate.",
