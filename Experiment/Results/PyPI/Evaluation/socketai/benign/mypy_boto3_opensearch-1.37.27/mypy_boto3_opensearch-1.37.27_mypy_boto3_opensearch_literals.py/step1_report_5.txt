  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS OpenSearch service and related constants for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements; string literals assigned to variables; the 'sys.version_info' check for conditional import.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No data is read from external sources or untrusted inputs; all data is hardcoded or imported modules.",
  "flows": "N/A, no dynamic data flow or user input processing present.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions and a version check for conditional import. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated elements detected. No hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various string literal types used across an AWS SDK context, specifically for OpenSearch. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version. All variables are simple string literals assigned to type aliases, with no runtime logic or data manipulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation. The initial copyright notice and documentation links are benign. The overall structure is typical for type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign set of type aliases intended for type safety and documentation. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is purely declarative with no execution logic.",
