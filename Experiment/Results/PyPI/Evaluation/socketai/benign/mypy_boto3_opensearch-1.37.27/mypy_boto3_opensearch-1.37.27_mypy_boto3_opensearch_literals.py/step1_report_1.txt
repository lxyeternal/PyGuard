  "purpose": "Define type annotations using Literal for various AWS service constants to enable type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for constants, reading sys.version_info for conditional import.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code is purely defining constants and type aliases without data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow, input, or output processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; the code consists of static type definitions and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static type annotation definitions using Python's Literal types for a comprehensive set of AWS service parameters. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is a standard compatibility approach. There are no dynamic executions, user inputs, network operations, or data processing that could be malicious. The code is purely declarative, serving as a type hinting utility module. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module providing type annotations for AWS service constants. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is purely for type safety and documentation.",
