  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security implications, logical consistency, and the accuracy of the malware, obfuscation, and risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code consists solely of type definitions and data models for the OpenSearch SDK, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external operations.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The copyright date in 2025 is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. The code is purely declarative, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, this code provides type annotations and data schemas for the SDK, with no runtime or external data processing.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is standard for SDK type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment. The code is safe and purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, this is a set of type definitions and data models for the SDK, with no executable logic or external interactions.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, secrets, or malicious code detected. It follows standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The evaluation is accurate. No security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—type annotations and data schemas for the SDK, no runtime or external code.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue:** The report states \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n- **Analysis:** This appears to be an incomplete or placeholder report, not an actual security concern.\n- **Impact:** No code or security evaluation provided; no malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** Since there's no code or analysis, malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here; just an incomplete report.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no executable or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated:** None of the reports detect obfuscation; the code is straightforward type annotations and data models.\n- **Risk:** The risk scores are appropriately set to 0 across all reports, given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final expert judgment:\n\nGiven the consistent pattern of purely static type definitions, no external data handling, and standard SDK schemas, **the overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Justification |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | The code is static, type annotations, no runtime logic, no external data handling, no secrets or obfuscation. |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is safe, standard SDK type definitions with no malicious or security concerns.",
