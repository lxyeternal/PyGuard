{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions and data structure schemas for the OpenSearch service SDK, facilitating type safety and validation in Python applications interacting with AWS OpenSearch.",
  "sources": "Sources include imported modules (sys, datetime, typing, typing_extensions), literals, and internal type definitions. No external input or data reading is evident.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or output. The code mainly defines data structures without executing any logic or external operations.",
  "flows": "The code establishes type annotations and data flow schemas; it does not include runtime logic, input processing, or data handling flows that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code strictly contains type definitions, imports, and structured data schemas. No dynamic code execution, eval, or obfuscated constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely composed of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports based on Python version compatibility. It follows standard practices for type safety and does not include any executable logic, external calls, or data manipulation. All imported modules are typical for type definitions. No indications of malicious activity or sabotage are present. The structure is consistent with open-source SDK type definition files, with no suspicious code segments or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions intended for SDK type safety and validation. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code does not perform any runtime operations or data processing that could be exploited. Overall, it is safe for use within the intended SDK context.",
