  "purpose": "Type definitions and data models for the OpenSearch SDK, primarily used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, TypedDict classes, constants, and literals within the module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external data or perform runtime operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or external data handling; purely declarative type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual copyright year 2025, but no malicious or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports for compatibility. There are no executable statements, data processing, external calls, secrets, obfuscated code, or runtime logic. The purpose is to provide type safety and schema definitions for the SDK. The copyright date appears to be a placeholder or typo, not malicious. All indicators confirm the code is benign and purely declarative.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for the AWS OpenSearch SDK, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for use in SDKs and documentation.",
