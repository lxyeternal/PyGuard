{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and structured data models for the OpenSearch service SDK in Python, enabling type-safe interaction with the service's API.",
  "sources": "Constant imports of type literals, class definitions, and TypedDict declarations that define data schemas; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that process untrusted input; all data models are for internal SDK use, and no code execution or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is purely declarative with type annotations and data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code strictly consists of type annotations and data models, with no runtime logic or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and type definitions, and defines numerous TypedDict classes to model request and response data structures for the OpenSearch service. All class and type definitions are standard for SDK type hinting. There are no functions, no data processing, no network calls, or executable logic. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a standard, comprehensive type annotation module intended for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static data models for type checking and contains no executable, network, or malicious code. It is safe and appears to be purely declarative SDK type definitions.",
