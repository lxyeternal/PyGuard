  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and conclusions, and cross-check with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Type definitions and data models for OpenSearch API.  \n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, defining numerous TypedDict classes, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or malicious code. The mention of the copyright date being 2025 is noted as unusual but not malicious.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, purely for type checking, with no malware or security risk.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Type definitions and data models for the SDK, enabling type safety.  \n- **Analysis:** The report emphasizes the absence of external data handling, runtime logic, or executable code, correctly noting that the code is purely declarative.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious activity.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Type definitions and data schemas for AWS SDKs.  \n- **Analysis:** The report again confirms that the code contains only type annotations, TypedDicts, and standard imports, with no runtime logic or external system interaction.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, safe, and purely for type safety.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and data structures for the OpenSearch SDK.  \n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous reports, it notes that the code is only data schemas, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard SDK schema code.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Error:** \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.  \n- **Analysis:** This indicates that the report does not contain any substantive analysis or data. It might be a placeholder or a failed fetch.  \n- **Conclusion:** No meaningful information to evaluate.  \n- **Verdict:** No concerns, just an empty report.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking with the code content:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is solely composed of type definitions, TypedDict classes, conditional imports, and constants.  \n- No executable logic, no data processing, no external calls, no secrets, no obfuscated code, no malware signatures are present.  \n- The copyright date of 2025 is unusual but not malicious or suspicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for SDK validation, with no malicious or security issues.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, purely declarative, and intended for static type checking.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code is a typical SDK type definition module.",
