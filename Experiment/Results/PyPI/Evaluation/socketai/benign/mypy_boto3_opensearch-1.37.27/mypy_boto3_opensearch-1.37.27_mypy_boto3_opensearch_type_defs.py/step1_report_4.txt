{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for OpenSearch service type definitions used in AWS SDKs.",
  "sources": "Constant imports from literals module, type annotations for TypedDict, class definitions for data structures, and function/method definitions for API requests and responses.",
  "sinks": "Usage of data structures like ResponseMetadata, data source identifiers, connection IDs, and domain names; no untrusted input handling or external system interaction present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request parameters to response structures, with no external data processing or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; all type definitions follow standard patterns. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly comprises type annotations, data structure definitions using TypedDict, constant imports, and conditional imports for compatibility. It does not include executable logic, dynamic code execution, or external calls. The structure is typical for SDK type definitions, aiming for data validation and type safety. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, as it merely defines data schemas for API interactions. The code is well-structured and adheres to standard typing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely for type definitions and data structures related to AWS OpenSearch service. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is standard SDK schema code with no security risks or suspicious anomalies.",
