{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and data models for the OpenSearch service API, used for structured data validation and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant values, type annotations, and data structure definitions; primarily from type annotations, imported literals, and variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations; the code mainly defines data schemas and types.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to data validation and structure definitions; no executable data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of type definitions and schema declarations; no runtime or malicious code logic is present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected. The copyright date is set in 2025, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports type utilities and literals, and defines numerous TypedDict classes to specify data structures for the OpenSearch API. It uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility. There are no functions, runtime logic, or external data handling, which reduces the risk of malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the presence of copyright and documentation comments, which are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. No external code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining data schemas for API interactions. There is no malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risk present in this module. It appears to be a legitimate type definition file used for type checking and documentation purposes.",
