  "purpose": "Type annotations for opensearch service client paginators.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static code with imports and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing; method accepts kwargs but does not process external input.",
  "flows": "The paginate() method forwards kwargs to underlying boto3 paginator; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of kwargs is standard; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured SDK helper class defining a paginator with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It does not process external data or perform network operations. The only minor point is the acceptance of kwargs in paginate(), which could be misused if untrusted data is passed, but this is typical for SDK wrappers. The code's design and implementation are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the use of kwargs, which is common in SDK patterns and not inherently risky. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscation score is 0. The risk score should be set at approximately 0.2 to reflect the slight potential for misuse if untrusted input is passed, but overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
