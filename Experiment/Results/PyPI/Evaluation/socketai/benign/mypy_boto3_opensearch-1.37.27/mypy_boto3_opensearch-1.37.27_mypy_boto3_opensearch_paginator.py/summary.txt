  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the use of kwargs, which is common in SDK patterns and not inherently risky. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscation score is 0. The risk score should be set at approximately 0.2 to reflect the slight potential for misuse if untrusted input is passed, but overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use."
