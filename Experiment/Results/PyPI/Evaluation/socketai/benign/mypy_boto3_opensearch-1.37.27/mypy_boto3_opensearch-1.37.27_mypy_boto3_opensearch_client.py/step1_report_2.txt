  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for interacting with Amazon OpenSearch Service via boto3, including method signatures, request and response types, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; method definitions with **kwargs unpacking request types; property and method definitions with no code execution.",
  "sinks": "Method signatures with **kwargs unpacking request types; property and method signatures returning types or performing no side effects.",
  "flows": "User calls client methods with parameters; parameters unpacked from request type definitions; no data flows to external systems or networks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features. All imports are standard, and method signatures are typical for boto3 stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured type annotation and stub class for boto3's OpenSearch Service client. It defines method signatures with appropriate request and response types, properties, and exception classes. No runtime code, no data processing, network activity, or code execution occurs. The code appears to be a straightforward, auto-generated interface for AWS SDK with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated SDK interface for AWS OpenSearch Service with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It provides type safety and documentation for client interactions without any harmful logic.",
