{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS OpenSearch SDK client, serving as a static, type-safe wrapper with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures with type annotations, and documentation links.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types; no data leaks, external calls, or runtime data processing.",
  "flows": "User calls with parameters; no data flow or runtime execution within the code.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and method signatures for the OpenSearch client, designed for static type checking. It contains no executable code, no network or data processing, and no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Documentation links confirm standard SDK usage. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with its nature as a purely declarative interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scores are appropriate and justified given its static, type-annotated nature.",
