  "sources": "Import statements, class and method definitions, docstrings, type annotations, property decorators, and constants.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that invoke AWS API operations; no explicit sinks for untrusted data or system commands.",
  "flows": "Method calls and API interactions following user input via method parameters; no evidence of data flow leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code is primarily interface definitions, type annotations, and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard stub definition for boto3 client, including type annotations, property methods, and docstrings referencing AWS documentation. There are no dynamic code executions, network connections, or data leaks within this snippet. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type hinting stub for AWS OpenSearch client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type definition and client interface for AWS OpenSearch service with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as an interface layer with no executable logic that could be exploited. Overall, it is safe with a low malware and security risk score.",
