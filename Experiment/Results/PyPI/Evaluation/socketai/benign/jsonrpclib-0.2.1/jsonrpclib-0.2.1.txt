      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is standard serialization/deserialization logic with a notable security risk arising from dynamic import and class instantiation based on untrusted input. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main concern is the potential for remote code execution if malicious data is processed. The malware score should be 0, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.75, reflecting the significant risk posed by the current implementation. Proper validation, whitelisting, or sandboxing is recommended to mitigate this vulnerability."

      "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, standard JSON-RPC client library with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or high security risk. The minor predictability of request IDs does not constitute a security concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low risk due to network communication but no active threats."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. All reports correctly identify its straightforward nature. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0 across all assessments. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is an overestimation given the code's simplicity. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security threat."

The scores assigned across reports are appropriate, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting the use of dynamic string formatting and singleton pattern, which are standard practices here."

The scores assigned are appropriate and reflect the code's behavior. Minor concerns about shared mutable class variables exist but do not constitute security risks. Overall, the code is safe, and no modifications are necessary."
