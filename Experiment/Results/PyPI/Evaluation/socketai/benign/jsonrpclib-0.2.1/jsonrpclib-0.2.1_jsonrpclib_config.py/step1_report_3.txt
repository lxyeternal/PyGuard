  "purpose": "Define configuration and class management for JSON serialization in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attributes, class definitions, and sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write data to external sources or execute untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily configuration setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a configuration class with static attributes and a class for managing local classes. It constructs a user agent string using sys.version_info, which is standard. No input validation, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are present. No external network connections, file operations, or other risky behaviors are found. The overall structure is typical for configuration modules and does not contain any malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup for JSON serialization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
