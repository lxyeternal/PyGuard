  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. All reports correctly identify its straightforward nature. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0 across all assessments. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is an overestimation given the code's simplicity. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security threat."
