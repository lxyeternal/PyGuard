  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, standard JSON-RPC client library with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or high security risk. The minor predictability of request IDs does not constitute a security concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low risk due to network communication but no active threats."
