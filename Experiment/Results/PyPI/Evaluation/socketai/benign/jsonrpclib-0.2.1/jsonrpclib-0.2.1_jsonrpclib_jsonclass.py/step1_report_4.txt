  "purpose": "This code provides serialization and deserialization functions for custom Python objects using a JSON-compatible format, with support for handling module and class names.",
  "sources": "Reading attributes of objects, inspecting modules and classes, and processing input objects for serialization or deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of modules and classes during deserialization; setting attributes on objects; calling potentially arbitrary class constructors.",
  "flows": "Input objects are recursively serialized; during deserialization, module and class names are used to dynamically import and instantiate objects, then attributes are set.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.getmodule() and dynamic __import__, which can be exploited to load malicious modules. No explicit validation of imported modules or class safety. No restrictions on the classes instantiated; potential to instantiate arbitrary classes if module/class names are manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serializes and deserializes Python objects to/from JSON-like structures. Serialization handles supported types, including custom objects with __jsonclass__ attributes. Deserialization involves reconstructing objects via dynamic import and constructor invocation. The dynamic import and class instantiation pose security concerns, especially if input data is untrusted, as it could lead to remote code execution through malicious module or class names. There is no sandboxing, validation, or whitelisting of modules/classes, making this susceptible to supply chain or deserialization attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code’s use of dynamic imports and class instantiation based on input data represents a significant security risk if inputs are untrusted. It could allow an attacker to load malicious modules or instantiate arbitrary classes, potentially leading to remote code execution. The serialization logic itself is standard, but the deserialization process must be carefully protected against malicious data.",
