{
  "purpose": "The code provides serialization and deserialization functions for custom objects, particularly for handling JSON-like structures with support for classes and attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters 'obj', 'serialize_method', 'ignore_attribute', and 'ignore', as well as from object attributes and module imports during deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of 'setattr' to assign attributes during load, dynamic import of modules during load, and calling class constructors with parameters during load.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'obj' through recursive dumping or loading functions, possibly invoking class constructors and attribute settings based on input data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'inspect.getmodule' and dynamic 'import' for classes based on data, which could be manipulated if the input data is untrusted. No explicit hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code's logic appears straightforward and intended for serialization/deserialization.",
  "analysis": "The code's dump function recursively serializes objects, adding class information and attributes, with support for custom serialization methods. The load function reconstructs objects by importing modules and calling constructors with parameters, then setting additional attributes. The dynamic import based on data could be exploited if untrusted data provides malicious module or class names, but no explicit malicious code or backdoors are present. The use of regular expressions to sanitize module names mitigates some risks. No suspicious code injection, data leakage, or malware signatures are detected. Overall, the logic appears standard for serialization/deserialization with moderate potential for misuse if input data is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard serialization/deserialization tasks with dynamic class loading based on input data. While the approach can be exploited if malicious data is supplied, there are no indications of intentional malicious behavior or malware embedded in this code. The primary concern is the potential for module or class import attacks if inputs are not properly validated, but the code includes some sanitization measures.",
