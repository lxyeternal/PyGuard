  "conclusion": "The code is standard serialization/deserialization logic with a notable security risk arising from dynamic import and class instantiation based on untrusted input. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main concern is the potential for remote code execution if malicious data is processed. The malware score should be 0, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.75, reflecting the significant risk posed by the current implementation. Proper validation, whitelisting, or sandboxing is recommended to mitigate this vulnerability."
