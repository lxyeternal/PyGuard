  "purpose": "Manage and store request and response objects for a session with fixed size buffers, providing methods to add, retrieve, and clear history.",
  "sources": "Methods add_response, add_request, request, response, and clear; internal data structures requests and responses.",
  "sinks": "None; internal data storage without external data flow or output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from add_response/add_request into internal lists, retrieved via request/response properties, cleared via clear().",
  "anomalies": "Use of class variables for mutable state (requests, responses) instead of instance variables; no input validation or external communication; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern to manage session history with fixed size buffers. It stores requests and responses internally, providing methods to add new entries, retrieve the latest, and clear data. The use of class variables for mutable state could lead to shared state issues if multiple instances are created outside the singleton pattern, but this is not malicious. The code does not perform any external communication, data leaks, or obfuscation. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is straightforward and typical for session management. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign and simple nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward session history handler with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and reflect the code's behavior. Minor concerns about shared mutable class variables exist but do not constitute security risks. Overall, the code is safe, and no modifications are necessary.",
