{
  "purpose": "Manage and store request and response history within a session, with a fixed size buffer and singleton pattern.",
  "sources": "Methods that accept 'response_obj' and 'request_obj' as parameters in add_response and add_request.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this code.",
  "flows": "Input objects are appended to internal lists; no further data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of class-level mutable lists for requests and responses can lead to shared state issues but not malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a singleton pattern to maintain a session history with fixed size. It provides methods to add responses and requests, with safeguards for size limitations. The 'clear' method empties the stored history. There are no evident sources of untrusted data, external communication, or obfuscated/malicious code. The code appears to be a standard session history manager without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward session history manager with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It manages internal data without external interactions or sensitive data leaks.",
