{
  "purpose": "Manage and store a fixed-size history of request and response objects for a session, allowing retrieval of the latest request/response and clearing history.",
  "sources": "No explicit external input sources; internal methods handle data storage. No data is read from untrusted sources within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in class variables; no direct output or transmission occurs in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Requests and responses are appended to internal lists; latest request/response can be retrieved via properties; the clear method empties stored data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The logic is straightforward and typical for session history management.",
  "analysis": "The class implements singleton pattern via instance method; manages requests and responses with fixed size, trimming old entries. No external input handling or output occurs, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is standard for session history tracking, with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign session history tracker without any malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any data leakage, code injection, or external communication. The implementation is straightforward and typical for such use cases.",
