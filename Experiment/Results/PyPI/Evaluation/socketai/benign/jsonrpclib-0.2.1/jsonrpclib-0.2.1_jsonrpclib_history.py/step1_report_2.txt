{
  "purpose": "Manage session history by storing requests and responses with a fixed size, allowing retrieval of the latest entries and clearing stored data.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process untrusted data in a way that could cause harm or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as no external input is processed into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward session management.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a singleton pattern to manage session history with request and response lists, capping their size. Methods for adding requests/responses, retrieving latest entries, and clearing data are standard. No external data input handling, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are observed. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple session history manager with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions as intended for managing session data.",
