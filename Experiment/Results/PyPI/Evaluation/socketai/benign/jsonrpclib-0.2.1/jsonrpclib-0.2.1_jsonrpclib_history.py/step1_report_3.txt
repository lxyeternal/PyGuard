  "purpose": "Manage session history by storing request and response objects, with methods to add, retrieve the latest, and clear stored data.",
  "sources": "Request objects passed to add_request(), Response objects passed to add_response()",
  "sinks": "None apparent; code does not process untrusted data beyond storing it",
  "flows": "Input (add_request/add_response) -> stored in internal lists -> retrieval via request/response properties",
  "anomalies": "Use of class variables for instance storage and static list sizes; no direct anomalies or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The class implements a singleton pattern for session history management, with methods to add requests and responses, and retrieve the latest ones. It maintains a fixed size buffer for each list, truncating older entries. The code appears standard, with no external data or environment variable usage, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network or file operations. The logic is straightforward and does not involve any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard session history handler with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply stores and retrieves request-response data with size-limited buffers. No vulnerabilities, malware, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
