{
  "purpose": "This class manages session history by storing requests and responses, allowing retrieval and clearing of stored data.",
  "sources": "Methods `add_request`, `add_response`, and properties `request`, `response` that access the request and response lists.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external output; no network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Input data (request_obj, response_obj) are appended to internal lists; retrieval of latest request/response is via properties; `clear` resets the lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious or malicious patterns. The code appears to be standard session management logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class to store a fixed number (20) of request and response objects, with methods to add and retrieve the latest entries. The `add_response` and `add_request` methods handle list truncation to maintain size. The `clear` method resets stored data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The class does not perform any network activity, file access, or data exfiltration. Overall, it appears to be a benign implementation of session history storage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward session history management class with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely handles internal data storage without external interactions or obfuscated logic.",
