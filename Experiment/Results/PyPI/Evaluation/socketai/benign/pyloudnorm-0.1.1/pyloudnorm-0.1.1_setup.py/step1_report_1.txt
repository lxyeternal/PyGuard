  "purpose": "Setup script for the pyloudnorm Python package, providing package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md (source) to populate long_description; no data flows to other parts that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. Usage of standard setup tools and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package. It reads a README file for the long description, handles a missing file gracefully, and specifies package info, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input or untrusted data is processed; no network calls or code execution is involved. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate, standard, and free of malicious behavior. It simply prepares the package metadata for distribution.",
