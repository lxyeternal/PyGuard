{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the 'pyloudnorm' Python module, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, static variable definitions for package metadata, and dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; standard setup function for package distribution.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content (source) flows into 'long_description' (sink), which is then used in the setup() call. Dependencies are statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup configurations for a Python package. It reads a README file if available, otherwise defaults to description text. Metadata such as author, email, URL, and dependencies are statically defined with no external input or untrusted data. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. Use of standard libraries and setup tools indicates routine package setup, with dependencies clearly specified. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscated code or malicious behavior. Overall, it is safe.",
