  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for the 'pyloudnorm' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; gathers package metadata from constants defined at the top of the file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data leaks or external commands are executed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README file into the setup configuration; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code follows standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script, importing standard modules, defining package metadata, reading a README file for long description, and calling setup() with package info. No external or untrusted data sources, no code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors identified. Dependencies are explicitly listed and well-known, with no signs of malicious modifications or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging the 'pyloudnorm' library. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
