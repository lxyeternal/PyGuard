  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- They consistently note the absence of untrusted data, code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code reads a README.md file for the long description, handles missing files gracefully, and specifies dependencies and metadata.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and malware/security risk scores are zero.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: it's a typical setup.py with no evident malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No code execution, external data fetching, or dynamic code is present.\n- The dependencies are standard, and the file reading is safe with error handling.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code does not contain any obfuscated code or malicious payloads.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward code.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- Given the analysis, the code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n- No changes are necessary for the scores.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No further action or concern is warranted.",
