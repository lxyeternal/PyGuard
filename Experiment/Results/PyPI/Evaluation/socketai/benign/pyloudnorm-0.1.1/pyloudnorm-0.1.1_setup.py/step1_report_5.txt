{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'pyloudnorm', including metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; uses static strings for metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input ('README.md') into the 'long_description' variable, then into the 'setup' function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup script using 'setuptools'. It reads a README file to include a long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input, environment variables, or network interactions are involved. The code structure follows conventional practices for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
