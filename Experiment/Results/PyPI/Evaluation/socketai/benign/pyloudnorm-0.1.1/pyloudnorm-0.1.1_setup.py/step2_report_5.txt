  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- No report mentions any suspicious code, external code execution, dynamic behavior, or untrusted data processing.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's straightforward nature.\n- The security risk score is also 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code only reads a local README.md file (with error handling) to populate `long_description`.\n- No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution occurs.\n- The dependencies are explicitly listed and well-known.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code uses standard practices for Python packaging.\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n- The reports are unanimous and consistent, which is typical for such straightforward setup scripts.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code content.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable considering the simplicity and standard nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- Malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Obfuscated score of 0 aligns with the code being clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk score of 0 is appropriate as no vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated overall security risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided setup.py code is benign, standard, and free of any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further action or concern is warranted based on the current analysis.",
