  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- They uniformly state that the code reads a local README.md file, handles missing files gracefully, and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata and dependencies.\n- No untrusted data, external network calls, code execution, or obfuscated code are reported.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and all agree on the benign nature.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present.\n- The dependencies are well-known and explicitly specified.\n- The process involves only reading a local file and calling setup(), which is standard practice.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- The reports are consistent; no anomalies or suspicious elements are detected.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which seems appropriate given the benign description.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; code is straightforward and readable.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script.\n- No adjustments needed for scores or analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
