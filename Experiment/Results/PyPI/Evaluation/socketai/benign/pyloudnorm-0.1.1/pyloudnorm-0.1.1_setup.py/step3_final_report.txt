  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the pyloudnorm Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static metadata fields; dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Reading local file into description; static data assignment; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with proper error handling for missing README.md.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script, importing standard modules, defining package metadata, reading a local README file with error handling, and calling setuptools.setup() with explicit dependencies. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious patterns are present. Dependencies are standard, and the code structure is conventional. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The code's simplicity and adherence to best practices indicate a benign, safe packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
