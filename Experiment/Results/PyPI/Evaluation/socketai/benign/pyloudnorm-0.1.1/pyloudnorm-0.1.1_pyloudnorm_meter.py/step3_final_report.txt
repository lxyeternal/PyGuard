{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a loudness meter following ITU-R BS.1770-4 standards, processing multi-channel audio data to compute integrated loudness (LUFS).",
  "sources": "Input audio data provided to integrated_loudness() method; internal filter application within the class.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data processed internally without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Audio data flows from input through filtering stages, segmentation into overlapping blocks, calculation of mean square, and loudness computation based on thresholds.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. Use of deprecated imports is present but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard loudness measurement algorithms with well-known filtering techniques. It processes audio data in a typical manner, applying frequency weighting filters, segmenting data into overlapping blocks, computing mean squares, and applying thresholds to determine gated loudness. No external communication, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident. The code structure and logic align with established practices, and no obfuscation or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an audio loudness meter based on recognized standards. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The low security risk score is justified by the absence of external data transmission or malicious logic. The code appears safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
