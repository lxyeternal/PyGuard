  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an audio loudness meter based on recognized standards. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The low security risk score is justified by the absence of external data transmission or malicious logic. The code appears safe for use in supply chain contexts."
