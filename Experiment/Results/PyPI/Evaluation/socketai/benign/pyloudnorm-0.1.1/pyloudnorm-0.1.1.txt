      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an audio loudness meter based on recognized standards. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The low security risk score is justified by the absence of external data transmission or malicious logic. The code appears safe for use in supply chain contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code is a simple, correct validation function with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The reports are empty and do not provide any critique or evidence of issues. Therefore, the code is safe, and the risk and malware scores should be minimal. The overall security risk is negligible."
