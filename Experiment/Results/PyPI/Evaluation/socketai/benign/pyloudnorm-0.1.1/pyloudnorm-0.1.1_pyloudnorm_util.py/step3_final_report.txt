  "purpose": "Validate input audio data for correct type, shape, and length constraints.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: data (audio ndarray), rate (sampling rate), block_size (analysis block size).",
  "sinks": "Potential ValueError exceptions raised when data type, shape, or length constraints are violated.",
  "flows": "Input data is checked for type and shape; length is compared against block size; exceptions are raised if constraints are not met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies that 'data' is a numpy array of floating point type, with no more than 5 channels, and length exceeding block_size * rate. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. No vulnerabilities or malicious actions are evident. The validation logic is appropriate and standard for audio data validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, correct validation function with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The reports are empty and do not provide any critique or evidence of issues. Therefore, the code is safe, and the risk and malware scores should be minimal. The overall security risk is negligible.",
