{
  "purpose": "Define an IIR filter class for audio signal processing, generating filter coefficients and applying filters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for filter configuration (G, Q, fc, rate, filter_type, passband_gain); data passed to apply_filter method.",
  "sinks": "Data passed to apply_filter method, which processes and filters the input audio signal.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> generate_coefficients() -> filter coefficients -> apply_filter() -> filtered data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code relies on established signal processing libraries (scipy, numpy). No unusual code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for creating and applying various biquad IIR filters based on user-supplied parameters. It uses well-known formulas from the RBJ Cookbook and Brecht DeMan for filter coefficient calculations, with no external data inputs or network communications. The only external library calls are to scipy.signal.lfilter and numpy functions, both standard for such tasks. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of audio filtering, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of audio IIR filters without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It utilizes common signal processing techniques and libraries, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
