  "purpose": "Implementation of an IIR biquad filter class for audio signal processing, allowing design and application of various filter types to audio data.",
  "sources": "Input audio data passed to apply_filter method",
  "sinks": "Filtered audio output; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified",
  "flows": "Input data -> generate_coefficients() -> lfilter() -> output filtered data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation using standard formulas and libraries; no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for designing and applying biquad IIR filters based on standard formulas (RBJ cookbook and DeMan variants). It uses numpy for calculations and scipy.signal.lfilter for filtering. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; the code performs legitimate signal processing functions. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard implementation. The code is transparent, well-documented, and relies on known formulas, indicating low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of audio IIR filters with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
