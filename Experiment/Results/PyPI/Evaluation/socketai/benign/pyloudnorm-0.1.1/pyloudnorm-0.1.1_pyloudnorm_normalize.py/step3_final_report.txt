  "purpose": "Provides functions for peak and loudness normalization of audio data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays; uses parameters for target peak or loudness levels.",
  "sinks": "Applies gain to data; warnings for potential clipping, but no external data or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input data -> gain calculation -> scaled output -> warning if clipping possible.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard audio normalization tasks using numpy. It calculates gain factors based on input parameters and applies them to the data. Warnings are issued if the scaled data may clip. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions are straightforward, with correct mathematical operations. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard normalization, and poses no security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate; I recommend setting malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 for a more accurate reflection of its safety.",
