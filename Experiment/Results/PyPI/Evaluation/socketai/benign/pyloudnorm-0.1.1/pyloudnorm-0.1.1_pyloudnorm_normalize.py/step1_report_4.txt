{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for normalizing audio signals by peak amplitude and loudness levels.",
  "sources": "Reads input data as numpy arrays, specifically the 'data' parameter in both functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs normalized audio data; no direct untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data is scaled by computed gain factors based on peak or loudness calculations to produce normalized output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Warnings for potential clipping are standard. No use of dynamic code execution or external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward audio normalization functions using numpy for calculations. Both functions compute gain factors based on input parameters and scale the data accordingly. The warning for clipping is a standard safety check. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling detected. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard audio normalization code with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It only processes data using mathematical operations and warnings for clipping, with no external or hidden actions.",
