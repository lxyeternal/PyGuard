{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for normalizing audio signals by peak amplitude and loudness, typically used in audio processing workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the 'data' parameter in both functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform in-memory calculations; no external data sinks, network communication, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from 'data', processed via gain calculations, and returned as output. No untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The warnings are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard audio normalization functions that compute gain factors based on peak and loudness levels. No network operations, file I/O, or data exfiltration mechanisms are included. The use of numpy and warnings is appropriate for in-memory signal processing. No suspicious or malicious code structures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate audio processing functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs straightforward calculations for audio normalization without external communications or hidden backdoors.",
