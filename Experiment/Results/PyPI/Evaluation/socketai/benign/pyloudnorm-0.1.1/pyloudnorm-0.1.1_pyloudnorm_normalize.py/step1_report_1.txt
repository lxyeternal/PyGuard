{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for normalizing audio signals based on peak amplitude and loudness levels.",
  "sources": "The code reads input audio data from the parameters 'data' for both functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data in a way that could lead to security issues. It only performs mathematical normalization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' parameter through gain calculations to the output variable, with no external data or network interaction involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard numpy operations and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and numpy modules. It defines two functions for audio normalization: 'peak' and 'loudness'. Each calculates a gain based on input parameters and applies it to the input data. The functions check for potential clipping and warn accordingly. No input sanitization, external data handling, or network operations are present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard audio normalization calculations without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not access or transmit untrusted data externally, nor does it contain any code that could be used for malware or data theft.",
