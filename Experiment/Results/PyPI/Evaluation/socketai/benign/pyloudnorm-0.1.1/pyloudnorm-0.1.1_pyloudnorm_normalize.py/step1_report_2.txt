{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for peak and loudness normalization of audio data, aimed at processing multichannel audio signals.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'data' parameter passed to both functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modified 'output' data, but no external data sinks or untrusted data output are present. No network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'data' input through gain calculations and normalization steps to the returned 'output'. No external data leaks or transmissions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code performs standard mathematical normalization without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical audio normalization tasks: peak normalization and loudness normalization, using standard numpy operations. Both functions check for clipping and issue warnings if necessary. No external network calls, file I/O, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions do not process untrusted input beyond standard parameters and do not contain any suspicious logic or hidden actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, implements standard audio normalization algorithms, and shows no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate audio processing purposes.",
