{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for peak and loudness normalization of audio data, primarily used in audio processing workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the parameters 'data', 'input_loudness', and 'target_loudness'.",
  "sinks": "The data is scaled internally; no external data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through gain calculations to the returned output; no external or untrusted sources are manipulated beyond the immediate function scope.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The use of warnings for clipping is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'peak' and 'loudness' for audio normalization. Both functions calculate gain factors based on input parameters and scale the input data accordingly. They include warnings for potential clipping but do not perform any file I/O, network activity, or system modifications. The calculations are straightforward and consistent with common audio normalization techniques. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident. Usage of numpy for mathematical operations is typical and safe in this context. Overall, the code appears benign and serves specific audio processing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of audio normalization functions with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply processes input data and outputs scaled audio signals. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
