  "purpose": "Top-level module for the pyloudnorm package, importing sub-modules and classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing local sub-modules and classes: .meter, .util, .normalize",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports sub-modules and classes from within the package namespace. There are no data inputs, external network calls, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a standard package initialization file. No suspicious or malicious activity can be inferred from this minimal code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package init module that imports sub-components without any suspicious or malicious content. No security concerns or malware indicators are present.",
