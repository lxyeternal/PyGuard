{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the top-level module for the pyloudnorm package, primarily importing sub-modules and classes for package initialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local module files (.meter, .util, .normalize) during import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to static import of classes and modules; no data flows from sources to sinks beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward and standard for a package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import setup for a Python package, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
