  "purpose": "Top-level module for pyloudnorm, importing sub-modules and classes related to loudness normalization.",
  "sources": "Imports from local package modules: .meter, .util, and .normalize.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; import statements are static and safe.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports local modules and classes necessary for the package's functionality. No external data sources, user input, or network operations are involved.
