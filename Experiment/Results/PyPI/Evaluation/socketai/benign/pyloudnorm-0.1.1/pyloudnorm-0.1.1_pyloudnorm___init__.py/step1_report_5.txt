  "purpose": "Top-level module for the pyloudnorm package, importing sub-modules and classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements: '.meter', '.util', and '.normalize'",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks or operations involving untrusted input",
  "flows": "Import statements establish module dependencies but do not involve data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements to include sub-modules and classes. There are no functions, data processing, or untrusted data sources present. The import syntax suggests this is a package's top-level __init__.py file, which is standard practice and not suspicious. No potential security risks or malicious behavior are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as an entry point to include relevant sub-modules for the package.",
