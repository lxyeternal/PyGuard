  "purpose": "Top-level module for pyloudnorm, importing sub-modules and classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .meter, .util, and .normalize",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present; only module imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports classes and sub-modules from local files within the package. It does not process external data, execute dynamic code, or include any suspicious logic. The imports are standard for organizing a package and do not indicate malicious intent or malicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup for the pyloudnorm package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies.",
