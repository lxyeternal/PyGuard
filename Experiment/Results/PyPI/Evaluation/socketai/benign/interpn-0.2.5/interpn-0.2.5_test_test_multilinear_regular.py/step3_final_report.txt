  "purpose": "Test suite for a multilinear regular grid interpolator, verifying correctness, boundary conditions, and serialization.",
  "sources": "np.linspace, np.meshgrid, numpy array manipulations, 'interpn' library functions",
  "sinks": "interpn.raw.interpn_linear_regular_f32, interpn.raw.interpn_linear_regular_f64, interpn.MultilinearRegular class methods",
  "flows": "Data flows from grid generation through interpolation functions to validation assertions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numerical validation for a scientific interpolation library. It generates grid data, performs interpolation, checks results, tests boundary conditions, and serialization. No external untrusted data, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The use of trusted libraries and straightforward logic indicates a benign purpose. Assertions confirm correctness, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for a scientific interpolation library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The overall risk score can be set to 0, reflecting the code's safe, testing nature.",
