{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the 'interpn' numerical interpolation library, validating interpolation accuracy, boundary checks, and serialization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays, grid points, and observation points within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are stored in local numpy arrays; no external data sinks or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from grid definitions and input arrays through interpolation functions to output arrays; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numerical validation tasks: generating grid data, performing multilinear rectilinear interpolation, checking bounds, and testing serialization. It uses known libraries appropriately, with assertions verifying correctness. No external network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The data flow is internal, and the code's purpose is clearly testing functionality. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk~0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign testing script for a numerical interpolation library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The supply chain risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe.",
