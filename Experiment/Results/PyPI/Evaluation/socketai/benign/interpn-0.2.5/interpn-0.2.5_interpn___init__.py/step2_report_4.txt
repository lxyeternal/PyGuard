  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, assess the reasoning, and ensure the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is a straightforward, benign package initialization script.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks is found.\n- The code consists mainly of imports, version retrieval, and module exports, typical for a Python package's __init__.py or setup module.\n- The \"malware\" scores are consistently 0, and \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, indicating no malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), and the analysis aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Code presence of issues?**  \n  The code is simple and standard; no issues are present in the code itself.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious behavior. Their reasoning appears sound and well-supported.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  The malware and obfuscated scores are all 0, which is reasonable given the analysis. The security risk scores are also 0, matching the conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Given the code does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or data handling, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score justification:**  \n  The code is transparent, with no obfuscation techniques observed, so 0 is justified.\n\n- **Risk score justification:**  \n  The risk scores are all 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the detailed reviews, the code is a typical package setup module, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese match the current report scores, confirming their appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the assigned scores are justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The package appears safe, and the review confirms the initial assessments.",
