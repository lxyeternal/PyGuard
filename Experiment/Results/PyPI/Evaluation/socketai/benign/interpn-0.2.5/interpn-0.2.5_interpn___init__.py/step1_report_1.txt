{
  "purpose": "To provide Python bindings for the interpn Rust library for N-dimensional interpolation and extrapolation.",
  "sources": "Importing version info from importlib.metadata; importing modules and functions from local files and the interpn package.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no external network calls, data leaks, or sensitive information handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; the code primarily imports modules and sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs. The use of __future__ import and version extraction appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and imports specific modules for the package's functionality. It uses standard Python practices for version retrieval and module exports. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or malicious intent are evident. The code's purpose aligns with providing bindings to a Rust library. No external data input, network operations, or potentially dangerous behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script that imports modules and sets metadata. There are no signs of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign setup module for a Python package.",
