{
  "purpose": "The code provides Python bindings for an `interpn` Rust library, exposing various interpolation and extrapolation classes and functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata about the package via 'importlib.metadata.version' and imports specific classes from local modules and the 'interpn' package.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted data can cause harm.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules and retrieving package version information, without any data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module that imports components and defines metadata, typical for a Python package's __init__.py. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or suspicious constructs are observed. It simply exposes functionality and package version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward interface layer for the package. No malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious patterns are detected.",
