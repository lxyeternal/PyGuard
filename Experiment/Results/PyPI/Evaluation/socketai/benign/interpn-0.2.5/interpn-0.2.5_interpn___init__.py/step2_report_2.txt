  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the details within each review.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\nThe code is a simple package initialization script (__init__.py or similar) that:\n- Imports version info via `importlib.metadata.version`.\n- Imports several modules/classes related to the `interpn` Rust library bindings.\n- Defines `__all__` for public API exposure.\n- Contains no user input handling, network activity, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behavior.\n\n**Security and Malware Analysis:**\n- No external data sinks or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs.\n- The code is standard for Python package setup and exposure.\n- No signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network communication.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified)\n\n**Critical Observations:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The purpose, sources, sinks, and flows are consistent and straightforward.\n- The code is typical for a Python package's `__init__.py`, serving as an interface layer.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of the code, the absence of any suspicious or malicious patterns, and the consensus across all reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The reports' scores align well with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the initial assessments are accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence points toward a safe and straightforward implementation.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown of any specific report or further analysis.",
