{
  "purpose": "The code provides Python bindings to a Rust library for N-dimensional interpolation and extrapolation, exposing various classes and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports metadata about its own package version, and imports specific classes and modules from relative and external sources.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code primarily imports and exposes modules.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing package metadata and modules, then exposing them as part of the public API; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks are visible.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure appears standard for a Python package entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module that declares its purpose, imports specific classes and modules, and exposes them via __all__. It uses 'importlib.metadata.version' to fetch its own version, which is common practice. There are no signs of malicious logic, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code structure is straightforward, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard Python package interface module with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply exposes certain classes and functions for external use, with no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.",
