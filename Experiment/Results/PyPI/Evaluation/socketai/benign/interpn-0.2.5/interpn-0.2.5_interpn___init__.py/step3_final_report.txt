{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the initialization module for a Python package providing bindings to the 'interpn' Rust library, exposing classes and functions for N-dimensional interpolation and extrapolation.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information via 'importlib.metadata.version' and imports various modules/classes related to the 'interpn' library.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not handle user input, network data, or external data sources.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, retrieving version info, and exposing public API components; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package __init__.py that imports necessary modules, retrieves version info, and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious. The use of 'importlib.metadata.version' is standard for version retrieval. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence indicates it is safe and appropriate for use.",
