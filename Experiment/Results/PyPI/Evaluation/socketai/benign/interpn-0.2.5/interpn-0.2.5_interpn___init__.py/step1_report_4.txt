{
  "purpose": "The code provides Python bindings to the Rust 'interpn' library for N-dimensional interpolation and extrapolation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using 'importlib.metadata.version' and imports several local modules and a remote 'interpn' module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the package metadata to the '__version__' variable; local module imports do not involve untrusted input; no data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. The code appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with imports, version retrieval, and '__all__' declaration. It does not process user input, perform network activity, or execute code dynamically. It solely defines the module's public interface and version info, which is typical for Python package initialization scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package initialization code for exposing modules and version info. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious data flow, and no anomalous activity. It is safe based on the provided content.",
