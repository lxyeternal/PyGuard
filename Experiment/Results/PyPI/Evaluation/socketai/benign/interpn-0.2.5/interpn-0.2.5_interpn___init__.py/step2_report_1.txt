  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward package initialization script.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks is identified.\n   - The code consists solely of import statements, version retrieval, and defining `__all__`.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - They appropriately assess the code as standard package setup, with no malicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the analysis.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign, standard code with no malicious intent, risk scores should remain very low.\n   - The current scores (all zero) are justified.\n   - **No justification needed for higher scores.**\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious activity is indicated.\n   - The malware score of 0 across reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports base their conclusions on direct code analysis, not assumptions.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - Scores are consistent with the findings.\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature, reflected in zero scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical package initialization script with no suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated elements. All analyses confirm its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
