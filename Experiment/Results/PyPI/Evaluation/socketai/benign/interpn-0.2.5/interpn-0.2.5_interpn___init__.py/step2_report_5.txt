  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any inconsistencies or overlooked issues exist.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward package initialization or module setup script.\n- No external data inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are identified.\n- The code solely imports modules, retrieves version info, and sets `__all__`.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity, straightforward package setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard package interface.\n- **Scores:** identical to Report 1, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** consistent and appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Standard package setup; no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as others; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malware or Malicious Behavior:** None detected in the code snippets or reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.\n- **Security Risks:** The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes for malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk are justified.\n\n### Justification for Scores Higher Than 0.5:\n\n- No issues warrant a higher risk score. The code is benign and standard for package initialization.\n\n### Consistency & Validity:\n\n- The reports are consistent with each other and accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified given the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical Python package `__init__.py`-like module that imports modules, retrieves version info, and defines `__all__`. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious behavior detected.",
