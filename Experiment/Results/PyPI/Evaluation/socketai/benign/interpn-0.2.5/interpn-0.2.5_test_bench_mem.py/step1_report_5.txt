{
  "purpose": "The code performs benchmarking of different multidimensional interpolation methods in Python, measuring memory usage across various dimensions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from numpy arrays, generates random data, and loads several third-party libraries (numpy, scipy, memory_profiler, matplotlib, and a local module 'interpn').",
  "sinks": "Uses memory profiling functions to record memory consumption; no data is written to external systems or network, and no untrusted data is processed directly into critical sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from data generation (np.linspace, np.random.uniform), through interpolation function calls, to memory profiling measurements. No external data or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code only performs benchmarking and visualization tasks; no hidden backdoors or malicious logic are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports data and benchmark functions, creates multiple interpolation objects, measures their memory usage with varying dimensions, and plots results. All library functions are standard for scientific computation. No suspicious data handling or network activity is observed. The code's structure is typical for benchmarking scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard benchmarking tool for measuring memory consumption of interpolation methods across multiple dimensions. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. All observed operations are typical for scientific and performance evaluation purposes.",
