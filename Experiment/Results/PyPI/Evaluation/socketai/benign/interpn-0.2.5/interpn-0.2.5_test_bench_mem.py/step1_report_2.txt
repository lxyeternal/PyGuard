{
  "purpose": "The script benchmarks memory usage of various interpolation methods across different dimensions, generating a plot of memory consumption versus number of dimensions.",
  "sources": "Reads include numpy.linspace, np.meshgrid, np.random.uniform, and external interpolation libraries; no input from external untrusted sources beyond standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "Uses memory_usage to monitor memory, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting, and file saving via Path. No data leaks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from grid generation and random data creation into interpolator initializations and evaluations, then into memory profiling and plotting functions. No untrusted data influencing critical security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The code appears straightforward, primarily for benchmarking and visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, generates multidimensional grids, and benchmarks several interpolation methods by measuring peak memory usage. It performs memory profiling, plotting, and saves the figure to disk. No network communication, system manipulation, or suspicious behaviors detected. The purpose aligns with legitimate benchmarking tasks, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate benchmarking script for measuring memory consumption of various interpolation methods across multiple dimensions. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The overall security risk is negligible.",
