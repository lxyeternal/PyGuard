  "purpose": "Benchmark memory usage of various interpolation methods across different dimensions.",
  "sources": "Reads include numpy.linspace, np.meshgrid, np.random.uniform, and possibly input parameters for interpolation functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or system effects; the code primarily performs computations and visualizes data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from grid generation and random data creation to interpolation function calls and memory profiling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to perform legitimate memory benchmarking tasks. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes multiple interpolators on high-dimensional grids, performs memory profiling of these interpolations, and visualizes the results. It uses standard libraries and open-source interpolation classes. The code does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system manipulation. No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. Its structure is consistent with benchmarking and profiling tasks, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate benchmarking script intended to measure memory usage of various interpolation algorithms. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious activities are detected.",
