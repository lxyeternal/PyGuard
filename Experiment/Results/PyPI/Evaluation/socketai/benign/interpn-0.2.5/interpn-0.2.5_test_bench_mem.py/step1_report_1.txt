{
  "purpose": "The code performs memory benchmarking for various multi-dimensional interpolation methods across different dimensions, measuring peak memory usage and plotting results.",
  "sources": "Input data generated within the code: grid definitions, random values, and observation points; also, reading of Python modules and libraries.",
  "sinks": "Uses memory profiling function 'memory_usage' to monitor memory consumption; no data is sent over network or written to external locations; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Data is generated and processed locally; memory profiling functions track memory usage during interpolator evaluations; no external data flows or command executions are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables. Use of standard scientific libraries with legitimate purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard scientific computing and profiling libraries, performs memory benchmarking across multiple interpolator implementations, and visualizes the results. It does not perform any network communication, file manipulations outside logging, or contain hidden behaviors. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and uses common open-source libraries for performance measurement and plotting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate benchmarking script intended for performance analysis of interpolation methods. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its primary function is to measure and visualize memory usage during interpolation evaluations across dimensions.",
