  "purpose": "Memory benchmarking of various interpolation methods using scientific libraries and custom classes.",
  "sources": "Local data generation (grid creation, random data, observation points), no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration, network activity, or file operations; all data handled locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from grid creation to interpolation, profiling, and plotting within the local environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific benchmarking: generating grids, initializing multiple interpolators, measuring peak memory usage during evaluation, and plotting results. It uses well-known libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, memory_profiler) and custom classes from 'interpn'. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The resource-intensive operations are typical for benchmarking and do not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not handle untrusted input or external commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific benchmarking script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its benign purpose.",
