  "purpose": "Benchmarking high-dimensional interpolation methods with generated data, performance timing, and visualization.",
  "sources": "Generated grid points, random permutations, internal data structures, environment data via gc.collect().",
  "sinks": "Local plots saved as files, in-memory computations; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows through interpolation functions; no external communication or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; standard scientific libraries; use of gc.collect() is benign and typical in benchmarking.",
  "analysis": "The code performs scientific benchmarking of interpolation methods, generating data internally, timing computations, and plotting results. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration are present. Use of standard libraries and practices confirms benign intent. The code's structure and purpose are consistent with performance evaluation, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured benchmarking suite for high-dimensional interpolation algorithms. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) assigned in some reports is justified by the benchmarking context and use of standard practices like gc.collect(). Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
