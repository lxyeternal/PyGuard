  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured benchmarking suite for high-dimensional interpolation algorithms. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) assigned in some reports is justified by the benchmarking context and use of standard practices like gc.collect(). Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious."
