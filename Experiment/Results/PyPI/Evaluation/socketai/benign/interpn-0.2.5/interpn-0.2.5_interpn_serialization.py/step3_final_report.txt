{
  "purpose": "Provides data wrappers for numpy arrays with validation and serialization, supporting float64 and float32 types.",
  "sources": "Input data in string, list, or numpy.ndarray formats for validation; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Serialization of numpy arrays into JSON strings; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or execution.",
  "flows": "Input data -> validation in _validate_x -> numpy array -> serialization in _serialize_x -> JSON string",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, ArrayF64 and ArrayF32, which validate input data (string, list, ndarray) into contiguous numpy arrays of specified dtype, then serialize back into JSON strings. The implementation uses standard libraries (json, numpy, pydantic) with straightforward logic. No external data fetching, network activity, or code execution occurs. The validation and serialization are safe and typical for data handling. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard data validation and serialization, and does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1). The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and supply chain security integrity.",
