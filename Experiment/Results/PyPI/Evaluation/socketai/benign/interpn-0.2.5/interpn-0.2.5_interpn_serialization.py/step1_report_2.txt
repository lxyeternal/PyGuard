  "purpose": "Define serializable wrapper classes for NumPy NDArray of float32 and float64, enabling validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "JSON strings representing array data, possibly from external sources or files.",
  "sinks": "Deserialization of JSON data into NumPy arrays; serialization of arrays back into JSON strings.",
  "flows": "Input JSON string -> Validator converts to NumPy array -> Serializer converts array back to JSON string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Pydantic models to wrap NumPy arrays with validation and serialization methods. Validators accept strings, lists, or arrays, and convert them to contiguous NumPy arrays of specified dtype. Serializers convert NumPy arrays into JSON strings of their list representation. No external data is fetched, no untrusted data flows into unsafe sinks beyond standard validation and serialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage of JSON for data interchange is standard. The structure is clean, and no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, safe data validation and serialization for NumPy arrays. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and straightforward.",
