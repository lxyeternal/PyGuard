  "purpose": "Define serializable wrapper classes for NumPy arrays of float32 and float64 types, with validation and serialization logic.",
  "sources": "Input data to the class constructors, specifically string, list, or numpy.ndarray for the 'data' field.",
  "sinks": "Serialization to JSON strings via json.dumps in the _serialize_x methods.",
  "flows": "Input data (string/list/ndarray) -> validation method (_validate_x) -> internal NDArray -> serialization method (_serialize_x) -> JSON string.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data validation and serialization but does not contain anomalies or suspicious code features. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to validate and serialize NumPy arrays of float types for data exchange or storage. Validation involves converting input data (string, list, ndarray) into a contiguous NumPy array of specified dtype, which is standard practice. Serialization converts the array back into a JSON string. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. Use of standard libraries (json, numpy, pydantic) is safe and typical. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for data validation and serialization of float arrays, with no malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices and contains no suspicious or malicious features.",
