  "purpose": "A simple test script that verifies Markdown files using an external function.",
  "sources": "Static file paths: 'docs/index.md' and 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "The external function 'check_md_file' processes the files; potential sinks depend on its implementation, but none are evident here.",
  "flows": "Paths from static file paths to 'check_md_file' function; no untrusted data flows or external network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pathlib' and an external function, then defines a test function that calls 'check_md_file' on two local Markdown files. It involves no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The external function's implementation is unknown but presumed to process files safely. The code's simplicity and static paths suggest no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1), which is justified given the context. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The external function's implementation could influence security, but based on this snippet alone, the code is safe. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
