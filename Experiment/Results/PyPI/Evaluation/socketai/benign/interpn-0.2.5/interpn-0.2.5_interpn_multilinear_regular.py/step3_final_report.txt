{
  "purpose": "This code implements a class for multilinear interpolation on regular grids, with thorough validation, type safety, and evaluation methods. It relies on external functions for core numerical computations, which are assumed to be standard routines.",
  "sources": "Reads input data such as grid dimensions, starts, steps, and values; uses external functions for interpolation and bounds checking.",
  "sinks": "Outputs evaluated interpolated values; no data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input arrays flow into validation and external functions; external functions process data and produce output arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; code is well-structured and standard for scientific computing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clear, validated implementation of a multilinear interpolation utility, relying on external numerical routines. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. External functions are named appropriately for their purpose. Validation ensures data type consistency, contiguity, and size correctness. No network, file I/O, or data leakage observed. Given the absence of malicious indicators and the standard nature of the code, the overall security posture appears very low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured numerical utility for multilinear interpolation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. External dependencies are typical for performance optimization but should be verified separately. Based on the provided code and reports, the security assessment is that the code is safe.",
