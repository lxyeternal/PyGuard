{
  "purpose": "The code implements a multilinear interpolation class for regular grids, primarily for numerical data processing and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments such as starts, steps, vals, and observation points (obs).",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is sent outside the class; data is processed internally and returned as NumPy arrays.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays into class methods, through validation, and into lower-level functions for interpolation and bounds checking.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation observed. No suspicious network or file operations. Use of third-party libraries appears standard for numerical processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a numerical interpolation implementation with proper validation, type checking, and size assertions. It uses well-established libraries like numpy and pydantic, and calls lower-level functions for core interpolation operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, such as data exfiltration, hidden code, or malicious network activity. The code's structure is consistent with numerical processing classes, and no backdoors or malicious injections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate numerical interpolation class with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It primarily handles data validation, interpolation calculations, and bounds checking without external communication or suspicious operations.",
