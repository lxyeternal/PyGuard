  "purpose": "Define a class for performing multilinear interpolation on regular grids in up to 8 dimensions, with methods for initialization, validation, evaluation, and bounds checking.",
  "sources": "Reads input arrays for 'starts', 'steps', 'vals', and observation points 'obs'. Uses internal functions for interpolation and bounds checking.",
  "sinks": "Calls external low-level functions (interpn_linear_regular_f64, interpn_linear_regular_f32, check_bounds_regular_f64, check_bounds_regular_f32) which may process untrusted data, but no direct sinks for malicious code or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input arrays (starts, steps, vals) are validated and passed to external functions for processing; observation points are used as inputs for evaluation and bounds checking functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. Usage of external low-level functions is typical for performance but could be scrutinized if source code for those functions is malicious; however, within this code snippet, no malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a data class for interpolation with methods for validation, evaluation, and bounds checking. It utilizes external functions for core computations, which are standard practice for performance optimization. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic is present. The external functions are assumed to be safe and necessary for the interpolation process. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward implementation of a scientific computation class with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific computing class for multilinear interpolation with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It relies on external functions for core calculations, which are typical in high-performance numerical code. There are no suspicious patterns or anomalies indicative of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
