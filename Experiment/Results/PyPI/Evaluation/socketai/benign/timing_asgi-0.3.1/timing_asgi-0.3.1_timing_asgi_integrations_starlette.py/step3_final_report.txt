{
  "purpose": "Extracts a suitable metric name from a Starlette route, using route attributes or a fallback.",
  "sources": "Iterates over starlette_app.router.routes, accesses route.matches(scope), and uses route.endpoint.__module__ and route.name.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input handling beyond route matching.",
  "flows": "scope → route.matches(scope) → route attributes (endpoint.__module__, name) or fallback",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward route matching and string formatting, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard route iteration and matching in Starlette, constructing metric names. It uses safe, well-understood framework features, with a fallback utility. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The fallback PathToName is a benign utility. The logic is simple and clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting metric names from Starlette routes. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are detected. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; they could be lowered to zero for an even more conservative assessment.",
