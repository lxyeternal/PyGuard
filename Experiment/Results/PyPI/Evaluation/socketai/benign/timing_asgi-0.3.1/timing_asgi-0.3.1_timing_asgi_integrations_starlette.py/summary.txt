  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting metric names from Starlette routes. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are detected. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; they could be lowered to zero for an even more conservative assessment."
