  "purpose": "Define abstract interfaces for metrics naming and timing client functionality in a monitoring system.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from class instantiation and method calls; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows leading to potential data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only abstract class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code defines interfaces without implementation or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present; the code is straightforward and purely structural.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two abstract classes with abstract methods, serving as interface definitions for metrics naming and timing functionalities. It uses standard Python modules ('abc', 'typing') and contains no dynamic code, data handling, external communication, or malicious patterns. The absence of executable logic, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors indicates a benign and standard design. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not pose any security threats or risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of interface definitions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
