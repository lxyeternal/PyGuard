{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract base classes for metric naming and timing client interfaces",
  "sources": "No external input sources; code defines classes and methods only",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract classes with method signatures but no implementations. It uses standard Python features such as ABC and typing. There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a typical interface definition for metrics collection, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of abstract classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely structural and does not perform any data processing or external communication.",
