  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for metric naming and timing client interfaces.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or data reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data from source to sink; code primarily defines interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes abstract classes with abstract methods, serving as interfaces for metric naming and timing functionality. It uses standard Python typing and ABC module features. No data reading, no untrusted input handling, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be purely structural, with no malicious intent or malicious code pathways.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard definition of abstract interfaces for metrics and timing clients. No malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks identified.",
