  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for metric naming and timing client interfaces.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; no data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code uses standard Python abstract base class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two abstract classes, MetricNamer and TimingClient, with abstract methods meant for subclasses to implement. It imports standard modules, and there are no dynamic executions, obfuscations, or suspicious behaviors present. No external data inputs or outputs are involved. The code appears to be a straightforward interface definition without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and conventional definition of abstract classes used for metric naming and timing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is a benign component intended for extension in a larger project.",
