  "purpose": "Defines abstract base classes for metric naming and timing client interfaces.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output happening.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink in this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of standard abstract class definitions and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two abstract classes with abstract methods: MetricNamer with a __call__ method expecting a scope argument, and TimingClient with a timing method accepting a metric name, timing value, and tags. The code uses standard Python features without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, no external input handling, and no dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, well-structured for defining interfaces, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a monitoring or telemetry library.",
