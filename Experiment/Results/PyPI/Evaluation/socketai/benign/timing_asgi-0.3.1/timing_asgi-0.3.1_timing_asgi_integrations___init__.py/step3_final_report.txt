  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import and re-export pattern, with no data processing, external inputs, or outputs. It contains no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign re-export statement with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
