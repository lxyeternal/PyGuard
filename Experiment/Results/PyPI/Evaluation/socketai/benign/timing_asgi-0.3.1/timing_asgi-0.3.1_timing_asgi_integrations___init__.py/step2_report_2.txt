  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the associated code snippet to verify the presence of issues, evaluate the reasoning, and ensure the scoring aligns with the actual risk.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .starlette import StarletteScopeToName\n\n__all__ = [StarletteScopeToName]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- The code is a straightforward import of `StarletteScopeToName` from a local module `.starlette`.\n- It then sets `__all__` to include `StarletteScopeToName`, making it part of the public API.\n- There are no data flows, external inputs, or outputs.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is minimal, standard, and typical for Python modules that re-export symbols.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All reports uniformly describe the code as a minimal, straightforward import/export statement.\n- They correctly identify that there are no data sinks, data flows, anomalies, or suspicious patterns.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code does not perform any processing, external communication, or contain obfuscation.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior or code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0 (no security issues identified)\n\nAll reports agree that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis of Scores:\n- The **malware score** is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The **security risk score** is 0, as expected.\n\n**Are any scores unreasonable?**  \nNo. Given the evidence, the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Since the code is a simple re-export, there is no reason to assign any higher risk scores.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are justified; the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security issues.\n- The reports correctly avoid speculation about malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are justified and consistent with the code.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nAccept the current assessments. The code is safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns.",
