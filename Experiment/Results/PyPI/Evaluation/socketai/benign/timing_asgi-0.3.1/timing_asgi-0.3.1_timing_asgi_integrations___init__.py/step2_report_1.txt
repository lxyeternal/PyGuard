  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement from a local module (`from .starlette import StarletteScopeToName`) and an `__all__` declaration to re-export the symbol.\n   - There are no data flows, processing, or external inputs involved.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and adheres to standard Python practices.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies:**\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, network operations, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are present.\n   - The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling suggest no security risks.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (high confidence in their assessment)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that the imported symbol (`StarletteScopeToName`) is benign, but since the actual implementation isn't provided, there's a theoretical possibility that the symbol itself could be malicious if it contains malicious code.\n   - However, since the code only imports and re-exports the symbol, and the symbol's content isn't shown, the risk is minimal unless the symbol's implementation is malicious.\n   - The reports do not claim or imply any malicious behavior in the symbol itself, only that the import statement is benign.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical re-export pattern, common in Python packages.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues in the code snippet provided.\n   - The risk scores are appropriate given the information.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - If there is concern about the actual content of `StarletteScopeToName`, that would require inspecting the symbol's implementation.\n   - But based solely on this import/export pattern, the code is safe.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** Remains at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Remains at 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Remains at 0, given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign re-export of a symbol from a local module. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain unchanged.",
