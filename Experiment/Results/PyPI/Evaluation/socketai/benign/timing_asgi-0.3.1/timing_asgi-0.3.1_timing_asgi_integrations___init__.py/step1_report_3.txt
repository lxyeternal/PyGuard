{
  "purpose": "The code exports the 'StarletteScopeToName' class or function from a local module named 'starlette'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'StarletteScopeToName' from a relative module './starlette'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data handling operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class or function from a local module and exposes it via __all__, indicating it is part of a package's public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks. The code's simplicity and directness reduce suspicion. Since it's a small module, there is no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module export statement with no malicious behavior or security issues. It simply re-exports an imported symbol, likely for API purposes.",
