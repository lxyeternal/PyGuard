  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import and re-export statement.\n   - The original code:\n     ```python\n     from .starlette import StarletteScopeToName\n     __all__ = [StarletteScopeToName]\n     ```\n   - This code only imports a symbol from a local module and exposes it via `__all__`. There are no data flows, processing, or external inputs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign, minimal, and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The detailed reasoning supports that the code is straightforward and not suspicious.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**\n   - Since all reports conclude no malware, obfuscation, or security risk, the scores are justified as zero.\n   - The code is a simple re-export, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The reports correctly assign malware scores of 0.\n   - No change needed.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a straightforward import/export statement.\n- No data flows, external inputs, or suspicious patterns.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
