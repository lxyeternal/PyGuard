  "purpose": "The code appears to re-export a class or function named 'StarletteScopeToName' from a local module 'starlette', likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .starlette import StarletteScopeToName",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports a class/function and includes it in __all__, with no data flow or execution of untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class/function from a local module and exposes it via __all__ for external use. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or network operations are present. The structure and content are standard for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export without malicious intent or security risks. It is standard in nature and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
