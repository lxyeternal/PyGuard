{
  "purpose": "Re-exporting the 'StarletteScopeToName' class or function from the local 'starlette' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .starlette import StarletteScopeToName'",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'StarletteScopeToName' from a relative module and then includes it in the __all__ list to make it publicly accessible.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol from a local module and declares it as part of the module's public API. There are no input sources, no processing, no data flow, and no potential attack vectors. The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling reduce suspicion. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module re-export with no malicious intent or security concerns. It functions solely as an export statement for 'StarletteScopeToName'.",
