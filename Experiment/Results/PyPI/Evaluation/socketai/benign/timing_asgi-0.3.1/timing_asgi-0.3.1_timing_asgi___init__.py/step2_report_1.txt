  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is minimal, importing local modules and defining __version__ and __all__.\n- No data flows, no external inputs, no suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0 — justified, as there is no security concern.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code is benign and simple.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with no additional concerns.\n- No data flows, no external data handling.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0 — justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment; code is safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: import statements, version, __all__.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same observations.\n- No external data, no dynamic code.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, straightforward imports, version, __all__.\n- No data flows or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code snippets across all reports are simple module import and export statements, typical for a package's `__init__.py`.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content.\n- Since the code is purely structural and does not process data or perform any external operations, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks evident.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
