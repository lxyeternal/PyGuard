  "purpose": "Export modules and define version for a Python package related to timing middleware and metrics.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .middleware and .interfaces",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules and sets the package version and export list. There are no dynamic executions, external data handling, or suspicious code behaviors. The structure is standard for Python package __init__.py files. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Python package initialization file, exporting certain classes and defining a version. No malicious or security-threatening behaviors are present.",
