  "purpose": "Module exports for timing middleware, client, and metric naming components in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .middleware and .interfaces.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for exports. It is minimal and straightforward with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. No external data sources, no data flows, and no potentially dangerous code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a module export setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and normal for a Python package index module.",
