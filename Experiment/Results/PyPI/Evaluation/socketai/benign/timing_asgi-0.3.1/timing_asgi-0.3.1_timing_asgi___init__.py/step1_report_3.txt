  "purpose": "Module exports for middleware and interface classes related to timing metrics.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.middleware and .interfaces), version declaration, __all__ export list.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simple import and export statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports and defines metadata (__version__, __all__). It does not process external inputs, execute dynamic code, or perform network or system operations. The imported modules might contain additional logic, but within this snippet, there are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious intent or security concerns evident. It simply imports components and exports them for use elsewhere.",
