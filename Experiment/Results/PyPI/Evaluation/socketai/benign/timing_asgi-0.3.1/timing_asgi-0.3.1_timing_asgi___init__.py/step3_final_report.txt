{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing specific classes from local modules and defining version and export controls.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.middleware and .interfaces), version string assignment",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, outputs, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Import statements and export list (__all__) without data flow or external communication",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, version string indicates pre-release but not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py-like module that imports classes from local modules, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for exports. There are no data flows, external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is typical for package setup and does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security or malicious threat. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
