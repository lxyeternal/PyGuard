  "purpose": "Middleware for measuring and emitting timing metrics for ASGI HTTP applications",
  "sources": "Scope data (e.g., scope['type'], scope['method']), response data (response['status'])",
  "sinks": "self.client.timing() calls that send metrics to an external monitoring system",
  "flows": "Scope data -> timing metric name extraction -> app execution -> response handling -> emit metrics",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of assertions for client attribute checks is standard. No network calls or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an ASGI middleware that times HTTP responses. It extracts the scope's type and method, and response status, to create metrics. Metrics are emitted via a provided client object. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage is evident. The code interacts with external monitoring through self.client.timing, but this is typical for instrumentation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior. Proper error handling and logging are in place. The code appears to be standard middleware for performance monitoring without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard middleware for collecting timing metrics in an ASGI application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply measures and reports performance metrics as intended.",
