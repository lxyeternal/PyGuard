  "purpose": "Utility for measuring CPU and wall-clock time, and generating metric names from scope paths.",
  "sources": "Reads system modules ('platform', 'time', 'resource') and scope dictionary ('scope.get(\"path\")').",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; uses scope data only for naming.",
  "flows": "Scope path data flows from 'scope.get(\"path\")' to string replacement in PathToName.__call__ method.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward handling of optional 'resource' module with warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules, handles optional 'resource' gracefully, measures CPU and wall-clock time, and constructs metric names by replacing '/' with '.' in scope paths. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. The use of 'resource' is standard, with platform-specific handling. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign and utility nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for performance profiling and naming, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments across reports are accurate and justified.",
