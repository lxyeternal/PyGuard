{
  "purpose": "Provides timing metrics for CPU and wall-clock time, and converts scope paths to metric names.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (platform, resource usage), time measurements, and scope dictionary input.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reads system info -> stores start/end times -> converts scope path to metric name.",
  "anomalies": "None; code performs standard system and string operations without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules, handles optional resource module for CPU time, measures system and process times, and converts scope paths into metric names. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. It does not interact with external networks or perform sensitive operations beyond system metrics collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for timing and naming metrics with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
