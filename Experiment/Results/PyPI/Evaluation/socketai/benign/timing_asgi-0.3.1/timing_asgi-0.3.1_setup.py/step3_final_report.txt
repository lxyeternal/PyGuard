  "purpose": "Standard setup.py configuration for packaging the 'timing-asgi' Python library, including metadata and an embedded long description with usage example.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, variables defining packages and package data, long_description string containing documentation and example code.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network calls, or untrusted input handling during setup.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to variables; no dynamic or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup script for a Python package. The embedded long_description is documentation, not executable code during installation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The example usage code is standard and demonstrates middleware setup, with no network activity or sensitive data handling. All signals and scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are consistent with a benign, well-structured package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with embedded documentation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
