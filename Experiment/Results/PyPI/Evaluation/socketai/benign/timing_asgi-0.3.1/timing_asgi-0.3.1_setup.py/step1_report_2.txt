{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup parameters for a Python package 'timing-asgi' and includes an example usage of the package demonstrating how to add timing middleware to an ASGI application for metrics collection.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, example Python script content, and import statements. It also reads input from the user via the command line when the script is run.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls (e.g., running the server with uvicorn), printing to stdout, and importing external modules. No untrusted data is directly sent over the network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "The example script flow involves importing modules, defining a subclass, creating an app, adding middleware, and running a server. Data flows from user requests through middleware to the print statements or external monitoring services.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or unusual dynamic code execution detected. The code performs standard setup and middleware addition.",
  "analysis": "The setup section is standard for packaging; no malicious activity detected. The example usage demonstrates proper middleware implementation for performance metrics collection in an ASGI app. No untrusted input processing or insecure operations are present. External modules are used appropriately. No code injection, data exfiltration, or system harm activities are evident. The code appears to be legitimate sample code for a timing middleware package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an example for package usage and setup. No malicious intent or security risks are identified. It performs expected setup and middleware logic without harmful behaviors.",
