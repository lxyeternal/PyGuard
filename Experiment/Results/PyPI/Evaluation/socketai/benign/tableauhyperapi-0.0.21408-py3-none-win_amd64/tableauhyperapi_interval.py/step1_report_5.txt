{
  "purpose": "This code defines an Interval class for representing and manipulating time intervals with components like months, days, and microseconds. It provides methods for creation, arithmetic operations, and string representations of time intervals.",
  "sources": "The code imports standard library modules (functools, typing) and a local utility module (.impl.util) for c_modulus and c_divide functions. No external or user input sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present. There are no network connections, file writes, or other data leakage points.",
  "flows": "The code primarily operates on internally set attributes and performs mathematical calculations for interval components. There are no source-to-sink data flows or untrusted data handling pathways.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is reliance on imported functions c_modulus and c_divide, which could potentially be implemented maliciously. However, given the context, these are likely simple mathematical utilities. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a well-structured class for time interval manipulation with clear methods for creation, comparison, and arithmetic. No indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The reliance on local utility functions is typical for modular code. No external inputs or outputs are handled, reducing risk of supply chain attack via this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a time interval class with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs mathematical operations and representations consistent with its purpose. No signs of malware, data leaks, or security risks are detected.",
