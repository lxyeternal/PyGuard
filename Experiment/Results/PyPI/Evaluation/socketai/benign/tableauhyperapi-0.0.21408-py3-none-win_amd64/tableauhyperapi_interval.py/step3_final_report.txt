{
  "purpose": "Defines a class 'Interval' for representing time durations with components for months, days, and microseconds, supporting arithmetic, comparison, and string formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports 'c_modulus' and 'c_divide' functions from a local utility module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; internal calculations only.",
  "flows": "Uses imported utility functions for modular arithmetic within property calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns; reliance on external utility functions without their source code; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward 'Interval' class for time durations, with methods for creation, comparison, and formatting. It relies on external functions 'c_modulus' and 'c_divide' assumed to perform standard modular arithmetic. No network, file, or system modifications are present. The code is clear, purpose-specific, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The main concern is the trustworthiness of the imported functions, but absent evidence of maliciousness, they are presumed safe. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of a time interval class with no malicious or suspicious features. The minimal risk stems from reliance on external utility functions, which are assumed safe. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
