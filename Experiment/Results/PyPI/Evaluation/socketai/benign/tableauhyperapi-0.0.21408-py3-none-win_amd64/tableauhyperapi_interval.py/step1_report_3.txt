  "purpose": "Define a class for representing and manipulating time intervals with components like months, days, and microseconds.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attributes, and methods that perform calculations and data manipulations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external system calls observed.",
  "flows": "The class methods process input parameters and internal state to generate string representations, perform calculations, and comparisons. No external data flow or network activity is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward implementation of an interval class. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of helper functions c_modulus and c_divide suggest modular arithmetic operations, likely safe, assuming their implementation is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a time interval class with methods for creation, comparison, and string formatting. It relies on external utility functions 'c_modulus' and 'c_divide' which are imported from a local module. The class performs typical arithmetic and comparison operations, with no network access, system calls, or input/output operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code's structure and logic are consistent with safe, standard practices for such a utility class.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured implementation of a time interval class without any malicious intent or security risks. It neither processes untrusted data in dangerous ways nor contains suspicious operations. The use of external utility functions cannot be confirmed as safe, but based on the visible code, no malicious behavior is evident.",
