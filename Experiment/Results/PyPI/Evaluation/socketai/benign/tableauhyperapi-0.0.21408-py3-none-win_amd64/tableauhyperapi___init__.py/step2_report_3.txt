  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes the API wrapper for Tableau Hyper, including data flow from user inputs to SQL execution.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution. The code is a standard API wrapper.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, with high confidence (0.9). The report concludes no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is primarily a package interface with no dynamic code execution or external data processing. The only potential concern is the import of a version module, which is standard. No issues detected.  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines and exports the public API, mainly package setup.\n- **Findings:** No external input handling, no network operations, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, confidence is 1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a typical `__init__.py`-like setup file. The version import is standard. No malicious activity or anomalies.  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Package setup, importing modules and defining constants.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or malicious code. The dynamic import of the version module is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, confidence is 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is a straightforward package initializer. The dynamic import of version info is common practice. No issues.  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Main public API module, exposing classes and version info.\n- **Findings:** No data processing, no external input handling, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, confidence is 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nStandard package `__init__.py` pattern, with safe version handling. No malicious activity detected.  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** API wrapper for database operations.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code execution, no network or file operations, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, confidence is 1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, a typical package setup file. No issues or suspicious activity.  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard package setup and API exposure module.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data flows are present.\n- The version import pattern is standard and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the static, non-executing nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, due to standard version handling, but overall very low risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to standard version import fallback, which is common practice)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured package initialization module with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
