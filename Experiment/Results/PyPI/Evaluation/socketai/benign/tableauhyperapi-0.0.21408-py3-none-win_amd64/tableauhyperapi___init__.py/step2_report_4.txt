  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is an API wrapper for Tableau Hyper, with no malicious activity, no obfuscated code, and standard imports.\n- **Assessment:** The code is primarily a module with imports, constants, and version handling. No data flows from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low, due to minimal version import complexity).\n- **Verdict:** The scoring appears reasonable. The risk score is slightly above zero, justified by the dynamic import, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines and exports the public API, with no untrusted data handling or suspicious logic.\n- **Assessment:** Standard package __init__.py style code, with imports and version handling. No data flows or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The low risk score aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, setting up package exports, version info, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Standard package setup, no data flows, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (due to dynamic import with fallback).\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. The small risk is justified by the version import pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Package initialization, import/export, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Standard __init__.py pattern, no dynamic code execution or untrusted data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** API wrapper, standard module setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No data flows from untrusted sources, no code execution, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- The code across all reports is a straightforward package initialization and API exposure module.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The slight risk scores assigned are justified by the dynamic import of the version module, which is a common pattern in package version management but could, in theory, be exploited if the source is compromised.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should be low (~0.1) due to the dynamic import pattern, but not higher, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports' reasoning)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scores are reasonable given the context.",
