{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports the public API for the tableauhyperapi Python library, facilitating interactions with Tableau Hyper databases, including creating connections, running queries, and managing tables.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading input or untrusted data; standard library imports and package imports are present, no external input handling or data ingestion.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points process untrusted data; the code primarily imports modules and sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code sets up module exports and imports internal components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. All imports and code structure appear standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package initialization script, importing various submodules and setting up public API symbols. It includes a version import, with fallback defaults. No code execution based on external inputs, no network operations, and no data manipulation or storage actions are present. The code's purpose is solely to expose package functionalities, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security concerns detected. It simply exports the API and manages versioning information.",
