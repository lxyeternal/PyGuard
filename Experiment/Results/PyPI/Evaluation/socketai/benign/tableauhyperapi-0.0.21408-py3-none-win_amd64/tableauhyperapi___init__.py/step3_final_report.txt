{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API and package setup for the tableauhyperapi library, including class imports, version handling, and constants, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Module import statements, version import fallback, and constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs processed within this code.",
  "flows": "Static import and export of classes and constants; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file, importing modules, defining constants, and handling version info with a fallback. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The version import pattern is common practice and not indicative of malicious intent. The overall structure is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score (0.1) is justified by the version import fallback, which is a standard pattern. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent.",
