{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main public API module for the tableauhyperapi Python package, providing access to classes, functions, constants, and version info for interacting with Tableau Hyper databases.",
  "sources": "The code imports various classes, functions, constants, and version info from internal submodules and exports them as part of the public API.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted data; the code does not process external input or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up module exports; it does not contain data flow or processing logic that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the dynamic import of the 'version' module within a try-except block, which is standard practice for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes and functions from internal modules and consolidates them into __all__ for public access. It includes a version import with fallback to default values if the import fails. There are no executable code paths that process user input or perform data manipulation. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data leaks, are present. The structure aligns with standard package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard package initialization module that exposes public API components without performing any data processing, network activity, or other risky operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
