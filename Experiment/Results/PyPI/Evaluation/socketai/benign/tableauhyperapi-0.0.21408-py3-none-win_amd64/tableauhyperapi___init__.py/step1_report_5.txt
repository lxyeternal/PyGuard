{
  "purpose": "This code provides an API wrapper for the Tableau Hyper database engine, facilitating database creation, connection, query execution, and data insertion.",
  "sources": "Import statements for various modules and classes, which are used internally and externally for database operations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or can lead to security breaches; the code mainly defines imports, constants, and module initialization.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes the package, imports dependencies, and exposes a public API; there are no direct data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic detected. The only notable feature is the conditional import of a version module, which defaults to zeros if missing.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly module setup, import, and export statements for the tableauhyperapi package. It defines public API symbols, handles versioning, and imports submodules. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or input handling is present. No signs of malicious behavior or unusual code patterns. The inclusion of a version import with fallback is standard for package version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper and module initializer with no malicious or suspicious elements. It serves to expose the tableauhyperapi interface and manage versioning safely. No security risks or malware signals are detected.",
