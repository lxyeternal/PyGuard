  "purpose": "Wrapper class for querying and manipulating database metadata via native C API functions.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as table names, schema names, database paths, and internal state variables.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external C API functions through ffi and hapi modules.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters into native API functions after conversion via utility functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or covert channels detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured wrapper around native database management functions. It performs input validation and error checking, and uses standard patterns for native interop. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data exfiltration are present. External API calls are typical for database operations and are presumed secure. The data flow is controlled, and no anomalies such as code injection or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign database metadata management wrapper with no malicious or suspicious elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the external API interactions and lack of malicious indicators.",
