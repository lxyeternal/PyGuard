  "purpose": "A Python wrapper for connecting to a Hyper server, executing queries, and managing connection lifecycle.",
  "sources": "Input queries and commands passed directly to native API functions without sanitization.",
  "sinks": "Native API functions executing SQL commands and queries, potentially vulnerable if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "User input → execute_query/execute_command → native hyper API functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API wrapper around native Hyper C API functions. It manages resources properly, employs thread safety for cancel/close operations, and does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The primary security concern is that queries and commands are passed directly to native functions without internal sanitization, which could lead to SQL injection if inputs are not sanitized externally. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or covert channels are present. The code relies on external input validation for security, which is typical for database wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure, and well-implemented database API wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security consideration is external sanitization of inputs to prevent injection attacks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting external input handling concerns.",
