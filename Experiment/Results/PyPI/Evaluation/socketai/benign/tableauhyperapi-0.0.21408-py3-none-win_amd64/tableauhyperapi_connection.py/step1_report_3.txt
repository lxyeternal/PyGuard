{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and methods to manage a connection to a Hyper database server, execute SQL queries, and handle connection lifecycle.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include method parameters such as 'query', 'command', 'parameters' dictionary, and connection parameters passed during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Data sinks include execution of SQL queries/commands, where untrusted input can affect database operations. No explicit network or data exfiltration code present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into connection setup and query execution functions; data retrieved from the database flows back via Result objects or return values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of insecure environment variables; no obfuscated code, suspicious dynamic code execution, or unusual variable names. No backdoors or hidden behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard database connection wrapper with typical functionality: opening, closing, canceling queries, executing commands, and retrieving results. All operations rely on standard CFFI calls to Hyper API functions, with proper resource management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. It adheres to typical security practices, with thread safety considerations for cancel/close. No suspicious anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured database connection handler with no evidence of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It functions as a typical API wrapper for database operations, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
