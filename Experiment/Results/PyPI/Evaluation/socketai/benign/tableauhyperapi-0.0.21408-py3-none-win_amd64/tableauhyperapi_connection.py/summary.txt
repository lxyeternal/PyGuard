  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure, and well-implemented database API wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security consideration is external sanitization of inputs to prevent injection attacks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting external input handling concerns."
