{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for representing and manipulating database table names, including handling fully qualified names with schema and database components.",
  "sources": "The code reads components passed to the constructor (__init__) and string representations of objects such as __schema_name and __table_name.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, execute commands, or handle untrusted input in a way that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor input components to internal Name and SchemaName objects, then to string representations and property methods. No external or untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code uses imports that appear standard. The code relies on internal parsing and naming logic, which appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a TableName object by parsing input components and validating their presence and types. It converts components into internal Name, SchemaName, and DatabaseName objects, and generates string representations of qualified table names. No data from external sources or user input is directly processed beyond the constructor arguments. The class methods perform straightforward operations, comparisons, and string formatting. No obfuscated code, code injection, or suspicious behavior is detected. The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing database table names with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal implementation for handling database table names. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident based on the provided code.",
