{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom Timestamp class for handling date and time with extended year range, similar to datetime but with additional support for historical dates and time zones.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules (datetime, functools, typing), and internal modules (.impl.util, .impl.hapi). Uses input data from datetime objects and possibly tzinfo.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from datetime and tzinfo objects; encodes and decodes date/time via hapi functions; manipulates timestamp values internally.",
  "flows": "Input from datetime or date objects flows through constructors and conversion methods; internal encode/decode functions process data; timezone offsets and datetime conversions are computed based on tzinfo.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution; code appears straightforward with standard date/time handling. No signs of data exfiltration or malicious network activity. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Timestamp class with extended date range support and timezone handling. It uses external hapi functions for date/time encoding/decoding, which is typical for such implementations. All operations appear to be standard date/time calculations, with no evidence of malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets, network calls, or file operations. The code relies on well-known Python modules and internal utilities. No anomalies such as obfuscated code or suspicious data flows are present. The only external dependency is the hapi module, which is used solely for encoding/decoding date/time values, consistent with expected behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a date/time handling class supporting historical dates and time zones. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions as a specialized extension of standard datetime handling, with no suspicious data flow or hidden operations.",
