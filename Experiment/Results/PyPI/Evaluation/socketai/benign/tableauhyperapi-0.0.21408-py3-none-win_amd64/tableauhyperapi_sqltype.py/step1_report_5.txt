{
  "purpose": "This code defines data types and their properties for a database interaction layer, including type tags, type-specific modifiers, and factory methods for creating SQL data types.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules, defines enums, classes, and static factory methods. No external input reading is evident.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that process untrusted data; the code primarily defines data structures and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no evident data flows from external sources to sinks within this code; it mainly sets up internal representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors are detected. Usage of external modules appears standard for a database type system.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines enum types, constants, and factory methods for SQL data types. It imports standard libraries and relies on a trusted external 'hapi' module for constants and encoding functions. There are no dynamic code execution, input handling, network connections, or data leakage points. The code appears well-structured and standard for such type definitions, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SQL type definitions, factory methods, and internal representations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears to be a benign, standard component for a database interaction library.",
