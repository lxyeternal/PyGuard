{
  "purpose": "This code defines data types and type handling classes for a database interface, including type tags, SQL types, and their properties.",
  "sources": "The code reads static constants, enum values, and class methods; it also imports various modules and attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; the code primarily performs type definitions and conversions.",
  "flows": "The code maps enum values and type tags to OIDs and modifiers, and creates SQL type instances via factory methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; use of dynamic class methods and constants appears standard. No obfuscated code, runtime code execution, or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines type tags, their mappings to OIDs, and factory methods for creating SQL type instances, including validation checks. No external data input or untrusted sources are processed. The only dynamic aspects are factory methods that generate type objects with modifiers, which are based solely on validated parameters. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. It appears to be a standard type definition module with safe practices, static mappings, and utility methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type handling module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It contains no external data input, unsafe operations, or malicious code patterns. Overall, it appears safe for use and does not pose security risks.",
