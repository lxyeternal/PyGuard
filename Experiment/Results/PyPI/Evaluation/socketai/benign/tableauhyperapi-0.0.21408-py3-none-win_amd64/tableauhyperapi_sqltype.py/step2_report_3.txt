  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines data types and mappings for a database interface, with no external data inputs or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as the code is purely structural and does not pose security risks.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on data type representations and utility functions, with no external data flows or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate, given the static nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** The evaluation is justified. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines data types and utilities for a Hyper database client, with no external input or network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — aligns with the code's static, utility-focused purpose.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is correct; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on internal mappings and type definitions.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 — slightly above zero; perhaps due to the mention of internal mappings, but no actual security issue is present.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable; the code is standard, with negligible security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines SQL types and properties with no external input or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate, as the code is purely definitional.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate. The code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very close to it, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured type definition module for a database client library.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0 — the code is static, does not process untrusted data, and contains no external communication or dynamic execution.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, benign, and well within standard practices for database type definitions.",
