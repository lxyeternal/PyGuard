{
  "purpose": "The code defines data types, type tags, and their mappings for a database client, providing factory methods for creating SQL type representations. It serves as a foundational module for type management within the system.",
  "sources": "Static constants, enum values, class factory methods, and internal mappings; no external data inputs or dynamic data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "The code establishes internal mappings and factory methods without external data flow or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. Usage of external modules (hapi) is standard for such type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, static module defining SQL data types and their properties. It uses enums, class methods, and internal mappings to facilitate type creation and representation. No external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved. The absence of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs indicates a benign purpose. The minor risk score variation (0.1) in one report likely reflects cautiousness regarding external dependencies but does not indicate actual security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe, and benign type definition module for a database client library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is appropriately 0 (or very close to it).",
