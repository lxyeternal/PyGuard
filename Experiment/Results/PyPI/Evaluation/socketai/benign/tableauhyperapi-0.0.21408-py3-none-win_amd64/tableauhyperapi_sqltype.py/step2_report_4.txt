  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code defines data types, mappings, and factory methods for SQL types. No external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns. The analysis concludes it's a standard, safe module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No signs of malicious activity, and the code is purely structural.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of external inputs, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code is standard for type abstraction.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous, no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, noting no malicious behavior, no external inputs, and standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** No concerns here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, standard type definitions, internal mappings, no suspicious activity. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), possibly due to the internal mappings or external dependencies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The minor securityRisk score seems to reflect a cautious stance on external dependencies or internal mappings, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as previous, no malicious activity, straightforward type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured type definition module for a database client or ORM, with no malicious behavior, no external data input, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which aligns with the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation with report 4 indicating a risk score of 0.1, likely due to reliance on external modules (`hapi`) and internal mappings, but nothing indicating actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis—no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n*The code contains no malicious behavior or payloads.*\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n*The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard Python features.*\n\n**Risk Score:** **0** (or possibly 0.05 to reflect minor external dependency concerns)  \n*No significant security risks are evident. The slight concern noted in report 4 is not sufficient to raise the overall risk score.*\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The existing reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or 0.05 if considering external dependencies, but typically 0 is appropriate here)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
