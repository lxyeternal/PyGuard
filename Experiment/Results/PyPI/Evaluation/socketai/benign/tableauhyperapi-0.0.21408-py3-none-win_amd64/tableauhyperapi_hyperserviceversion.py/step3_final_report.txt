  "purpose": "A simple Python class representing a version number with major and minor components, providing properties, string representations, equality, and hashing.",
  "sources": "Class constructor (__init__), property methods (major, minor), representation methods (__repr__, __str__), equality (__eq__), and hash (__hash__).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or modify system state.",
  "flows": "Instantiation via __init__ -> access to properties -> use of __repr__, __str__, __eq__, __hash__ methods; no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a benign, standard utility class for version management. It contains no external data input/output, network calls, or system modifications. The methods are typical for such a class, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent. The high confidence scores reflect certainty in this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility class with no malicious or security concerns. The existing reports and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
