  "purpose": "Define a class for representing a version number with major and minor components.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'major' and 'minor' during class instantiation.",
  "fires": "None explicitly; no external data or untrusted input is processed or read from external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class only stores and represents version data internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward data class with properties for major and minor version parts, along with methods for representation, equality, and hashing. There are no external data reads, no network calls, or dynamic code execution. The class methods are standard and do not perform any suspicious or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data structure with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard version handling without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
