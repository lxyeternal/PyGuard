  "purpose": "Define a class representing a version number with major and minor components.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; class attributes are set via constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no external data or untrusted sources used in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; class methods operate on internal attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple immutable class with properties and standard methods for version comparison and representation. No external data is read, no untrusted input is processed, and there are no hidden or suspicious operations. The code appears purely declarative, with no malicious behavior or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard class definition for version handling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
