  "purpose": "Define a class representing a hyper service version with major and minor components.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The class is a straightforward data container.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates version information with basic methods for representation, equality, and hashing. It does not execute external commands, handle untrusted input, or perform network operations. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured Python class for managing version data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a simple data model without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
