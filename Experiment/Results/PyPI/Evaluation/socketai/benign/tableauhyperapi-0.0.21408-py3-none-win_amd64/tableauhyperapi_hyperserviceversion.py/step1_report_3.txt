  "purpose": "Define a class representing a version number with major and minor components for a Hyper Service.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading operations).",
  "sinks": "None (no output, network, or data leakage points).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; the class is straightforward and only manages internal data.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates version information with properties for major and minor parts. It provides typical methods for representation, equality, and hashing. There are no external data inputs, environment variable usage, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected. The code appears to be purely structural and self-contained.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign data structure for handling version numbers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this fragment.",
