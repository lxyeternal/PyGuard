{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for representing and comparing version numbers of the format 'major.minor'.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file system, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; class operations are purely data encapsulation and comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a version class with properties, representation, equality, and hashing methods. It does not perform any data input/output, network operations, or system modifications. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are apparent. The class is well-structured, and all methods serve typical purposes for a version object.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class used for version management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard utility class with no malicious intent.",
