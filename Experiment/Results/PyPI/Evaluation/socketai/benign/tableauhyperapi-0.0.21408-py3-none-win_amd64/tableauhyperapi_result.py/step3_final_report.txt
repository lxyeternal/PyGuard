{
  "purpose": "A Python class that interfaces with a C API to read and process database query results, managing resources and converting data types appropriately.",
  "sources": "Data buffers obtained from the C API via ffi calls, including row data, column values, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures within Python; no external network, file, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from ffi buffers into Python objects through type-specific read functions, with resource management ensuring proper cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The __del__ method issues a warning if the object is not closed, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a database result set reader interfacing with a C API via ffi. It handles resource management, data marshaling, and type conversions securely. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or external data leaks are present. The resource cleanup and warning in __del__ are standard practices, not indicators of malicious intent. Data flows are limited to safe marshaling from C buffers to Python objects, with no external network activity or data exfiltration. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented database result handler with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It demonstrates proper resource management and safe data handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The scores are justified and should remain as assigned.",
