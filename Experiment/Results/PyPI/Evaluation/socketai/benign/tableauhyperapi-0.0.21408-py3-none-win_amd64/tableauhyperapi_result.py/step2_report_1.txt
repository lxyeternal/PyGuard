  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a database result handler interfacing with a C API via ffi.\n- No report detects obfuscation, malicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows.\n- The reports emphasize proper resource management, type conversions, and standard patterns.\n- The malware scores are all 0, and confidence levels are high (0.9-0.95), indicating agreement that the code is benign.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), aligning with the assessment that the code doesn't pose significant security threats.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is a straightforward implementation of a result set reader. No issues or anomalies are found in the code logic.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are identified. The code handles resource cleanup, null checks, and data conversions appropriately.\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Malware justification:** Since no malicious activity or backdoors are detected, malware score 0 is justified.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on code behavior.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code is a typical C API wrapper for database result processing.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The resource management warnings are standard and indicate good practice, not malicious intent.\n- The data flows are limited to safe marshaling of data from C buffers to Python objects.\n- No external network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is evident.\n\n### Final estimation:\nGiven all the evidence, **my assessment** aligns with the reports:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to resource management warnings, which are standard)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented database result set handler interfacing with a C API via ffi. It demonstrates proper resource management, safe data conversions, and no malicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**If I were to assign scores independently:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to resource management warnings, but not a security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and poses no security threat.",
