{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a template or stub for customizing generated Python SDK code, likely related to Azure SDKs, with no implementation beyond an import, a list declaration, and a function definition.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input, or data reading points are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist, as the code contains only declarations and an empty function.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward and boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal template for SDK customization with no logic, data processing, or network activity. It includes a licensing comment, a docstring, an import statement, an empty list declaration, and a function with only a docstring. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code's purpose is solely to allow user customizations for SDK code patches.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a placeholder or extension point for SDK customization, and contains no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
