{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a template or stub for customizing generated SDK code, specifically for Azure SDK in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it defines functions and variables locally.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only defines an empty list and a function with no logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. It is a standard template with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization, containing only comments, import statements, an empty list declaration, and a single function definition. There are no input sources, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious operations or embedded code. It does not perform any actions or contain any malicious logic. The structure is straightforward and typical of SDK customization templates.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder for SDK customizations with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated elements. It poses no threat and is purely structural.",
