  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Content Analysis:**\n   - The code is a minimal SDK customization template:\n     - Contains a copyright/license comment.\n     - A docstring referencing a customization guide URL.\n     - Imports `List` from `typing`.\n     - Defines an empty list `__all__`.\n     - Defines a function `patch_sdk()` with only a docstring.\n   - No dynamic execution, input/output handling, or external data processing.\n   - No embedded code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No network activity, data leaks, or external communications.\n   - Purpose is clearly to serve as a placeholder for user modifications.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Evaluation:**\n   - The code is static, benign, and intended as a template.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The `patch_sdk()` function is a stub for user customization, not executing any code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, external inputs, or data sinks.\n   - No anomalies or code anomalies that suggest malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - Given the code's purpose and content, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is a straightforward template, there's no basis for higher malware or risk scores.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious behavior.\n   - No modifications are necessary for the scores.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations, data handling, or network activity.\n   - It contains no obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n   - The purpose is clearly to serve as a customizable placeholder, which is safe.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign SDK customization template with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No changes are necessary.",
