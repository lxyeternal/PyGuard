  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - The code is a straightforward SDK customization template with no dynamic execution, input handling, or external data processing.\n   - All reports consistently identify it as benign, boilerplate, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - There are no embedded or hidden code segments, no hardcoded secrets, and no network or file I/O operations.\n\n2. **Code Content and Logic:**\n   - The code contains only:\n     - Licensing comments.\n     - A docstring pointing to a customization guide.\n     - An import statement (`from typing import List`).\n     - An empty list `__all__`.\n     - A function `patch_sdk()` with only a docstring.\n   - No variables are assigned with untrusted data.\n   - No functions perform any operations or data processing.\n   - No external inputs or outputs are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the code's harmlessness.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Vulnerabilities:**\n   - Since the code is a static template with no execution or data handling, there are no vulnerabilities.\n   - The purpose is explicitly to serve as a customizable scaffold, not to perform any malicious actions.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The assigned scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is entirely benign.\n   - No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present.\n   - The reports' conclusions are accurate.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a safe, boilerplate SDK customization template with no security concerns. All scores and analyses are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
