{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a boilerplate template for SDK customization, allowing users to implement specific modifications via the 'patch_sdk' function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains static comments, import statements, and an empty function definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process or output any data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static with no runtime data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static SDK customization scaffold with licensing comments, a docstring referencing a guide, an import, an empty list '__all__', and a 'patch_sdk' function that only contains a docstring. It does not perform any operations, handle data, or communicate externally. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence scores of 1, and malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's purpose is explicitly to serve as a placeholder for user modifications, and it contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK template with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
