  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - The code is a straightforward SDK customization template, containing:\n     - License comments.\n     - A module-level docstring with a URL for guidance.\n     - An import statement (`from typing import List`).\n     - An empty list `__all__`.\n     - A function `patch_sdk()` with only a docstring.\n   - There are no dynamic elements, no input/output operations, no data processing, and no external communication.\n   - The code does not read, write, or process any data, especially untrusted data.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or embedded code are present.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, serving as a placeholder for SDK customization.\n   - They identify no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Scores**:\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n   - The security risk score is 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - The overall conclusion aligns with the code's nature: a benign, boilerplate SDK template.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Misjudgments**:\n   - No issues are present in the code that would warrant a higher risk or malware score.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely structural.\n\n5. **Final Justification**:\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the reports' consensus, the scores are appropriate.\n   - The code does not pose any security threat, nor does it contain malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- I concur with the provided scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis code is a benign, standard SDK customization template with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the code's nature.",
