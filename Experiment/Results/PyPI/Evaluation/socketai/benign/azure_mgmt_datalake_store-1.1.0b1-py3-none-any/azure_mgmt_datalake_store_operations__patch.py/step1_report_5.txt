{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a template or placeholder for customizing generated SDK code, primarily providing documentation and a function stub for future modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module's import statements, the __all__ list, and the patch_sdk function definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no identifiable sinks in the code where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code does not establish any data flow paths from sources to sinks; it mainly defines a function and some variables.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code appears to be boilerplate or template code for SDK customization.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard licensing comments, an import statement, a definition of an empty __all__ list, and a function 'patch_sdk' with a docstring. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's purpose is clearly to serve as a customizable placeholder without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, template-based SDK customization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a structural placeholder for future modifications and contains no harmful code.",
