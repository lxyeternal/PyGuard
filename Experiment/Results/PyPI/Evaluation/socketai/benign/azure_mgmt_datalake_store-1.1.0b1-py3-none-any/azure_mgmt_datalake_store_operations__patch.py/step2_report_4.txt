  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a benign SDK customization template.\n- No external input, data flow, or sink points are present.\n- The code contains only comments, import statements, a list declaration, and an empty function.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is clearly to serve as a placeholder for user modifications.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does **not** read or write sensitive data.\n- It does **not** perform any network operations, external calls, or data processing.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0, correct given the code clarity.\n- Risk score: 0, aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The reports are thorough and agree on the benign assessment. No changes needed.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is a straightforward, safe SDK template with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are reasonable and justified.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on static code review.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is entirely benign, with no security concerns. The current scores are appropriate.",
