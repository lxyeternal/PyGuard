{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a template for customizing SDK-generated code, providing placeholders for user modifications and a patching function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports typing for type annotations and defines a function and a list.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code; it does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists in this static code; no source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; the code appears to be a straightforward SDK customization template.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a copyright comment, a docstring with a URL for further instructions, an import statement, a list declaration, and a function definition. It does not contain any dynamic execution, input handling, or malicious patterns. Its purpose is to allow users to customize SDK behavior with safe, documented placeholders.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK customization template with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not read or write sensitive data, nor does it contain any suspicious behavior.",
