{
  "purpose": "The code is a template for customizing generated SDK code from Microsoft Azure, primarily providing a placeholder function `patch_sdk()` for user modifications.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading points present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external communications, or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input/output operations, or data processing paths present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns. The `patch_sdk()` function is a placeholder for user customization and does not execute any code itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of license information, a documentation string, an import statement, and an empty placeholder function. There are no operations, data handling, or external interactions that could be malicious. The structure indicates it's meant as a template for customization, not for executing malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for SDK customization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a safe scaffold for user modifications, with no malicious intent detected.",
