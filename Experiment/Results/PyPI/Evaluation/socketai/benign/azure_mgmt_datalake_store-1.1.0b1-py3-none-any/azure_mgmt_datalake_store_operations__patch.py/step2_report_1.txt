  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the code based on the provided details.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward SDK customization template.\n- It contains no dynamic execution, input/output operations, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree on its benign nature, with confidence scores of 1.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, malware, or security risks are identified in any report.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, boilerplate template with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** Malware and security risk scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Correctly 0. Since the code is purely structural with no execution or external interactions, there's no indication of malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Correctly 0. No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately state that the code is a safe template.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The code does not read external input, write data, or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n- The purpose is explicitly to serve as a placeholder for user customization, not to execute logic.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed reviews, I concur with the reports' conclusions.** The code is a benign SDK customization scaffold with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the code's harmless, structural nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard SDK template with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and justified.",
