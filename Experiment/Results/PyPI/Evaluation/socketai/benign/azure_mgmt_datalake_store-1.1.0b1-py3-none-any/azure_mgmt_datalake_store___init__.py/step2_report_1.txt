  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations from the code:**\n- The code is a generated SDK module for Azure Data Lake Store management.\n- It uses standard import patterns, including wildcard imports from `_patch`.\n- No external or untrusted data is processed.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The comments and structure are typical for auto-generated SDK code.\n- The use of wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`) is common in generated SDKs but could be risky if the source is compromised. Here, it appears controlled.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`)**: While risky in general, it is a known pattern in SDKs for patching mechanisms. No evidence suggests malicious intent.\n- **No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code**: The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify the wildcard import as a potential concern but also note that it's typical for SDKs.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- No runtime data flow from untrusted sources or external inputs.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- All reports assign `malware` score = 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- `obfuscated` score = 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- `securityRisk` scores are low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9), justified by the clear, standard code structure.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n- No report suggests malicious activity or backdoors.\n- The only minor concern is the wildcard import, but in the context of generated SDK code, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and generated, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to the wildcard import pattern, which is typical in SDKs but should be maintained carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, generated SDK setup module.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The overall scores should remain very low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated at 0, and a security risk around 0.1.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a safe, typical SDK module with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
