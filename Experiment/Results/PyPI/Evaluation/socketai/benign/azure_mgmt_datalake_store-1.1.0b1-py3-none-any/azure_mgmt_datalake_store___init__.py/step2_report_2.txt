  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a typical generated SDK module, primarily composed of import statements, version setting, and optional patching.\n- No user input, external data processing, or network activity is present.\n- The use of wildcard imports (*), while generally discouraged, is common in generated SDK code for patching purposes.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; describes SDK setup.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No data leaks or external input handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import noted but typical.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low risk).\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk score seems appropriate given the context. The malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the wildcard import as a minor concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the analysis; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Similar observations; highlights the wildcard import as a potential concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score but still reasonable given the context. No malware present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Emphasizes the standard nature of the SDK setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate, as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Focuses on the import and patching mechanism, noting the wildcard import as a minor concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, generated code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varying (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting the minor concern about wildcard imports, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and generated.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor concern about wildcard imports, but standard in SDKs.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified based on the code content. No changes are necessary.",
