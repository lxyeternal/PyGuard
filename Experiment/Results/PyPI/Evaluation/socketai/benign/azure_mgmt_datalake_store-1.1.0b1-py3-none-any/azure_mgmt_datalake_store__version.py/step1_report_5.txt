  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Reading the hardcoded string '1.1.0b1' assigned to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating generated code by Microsoft AutoRest, which is normal; no suspicious activity or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a static version string to a variable and includes standard licensing and comment headers. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded secrets or malicious logic. The presence of generated code comments is common in SDKs and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is minimal, straightforward, and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, non-malicious snippet defining a version variable for a generated SDK module. No security issues or malware indications are present.",
