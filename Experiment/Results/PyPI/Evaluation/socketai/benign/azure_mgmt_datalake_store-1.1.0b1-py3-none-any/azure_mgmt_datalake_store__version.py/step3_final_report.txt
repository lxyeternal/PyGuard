{
  "purpose": "This code defines a static version string for a software component, accompanied by licensing comments. It serves as metadata or version information within an auto-generated SDK or API client.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only assigns a constant string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only static data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. It is straightforward and auto-generated metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, licensing information, and a single assignment of a version string. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, or embedded secrets. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriately set to 0. The code is typical for SDK or package metadata files, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static metadata with no security concerns. All reports and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
