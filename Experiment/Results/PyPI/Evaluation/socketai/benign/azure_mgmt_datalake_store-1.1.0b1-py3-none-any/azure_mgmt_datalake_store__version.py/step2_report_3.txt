  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple static assignment of a version string, with comments and licensing info.\n- No input, output, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated SDK or API client metadata.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; code is benign.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as harmless.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Score justification:** Consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Summary:** Appropriately low scores.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Score justification:** Correct.\n- **Summary:** Valid assessment.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n- **Summary:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Score justification:** Correct.\n- **Summary:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is purely metadata with no malicious activity.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated is 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- Security risk is 0, since there's no dynamic or risky behavior.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code is entirely benign, with no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely informational, auto-generated metadata with no security concerns.",
