  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static assignment of a version string with licensing comments.\n- No input/output, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated SDK or API client metadata.\n\n**Specific Review:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Confirmed. The code is just comments and a version string. No issues detected.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware and security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate. Confidence is high.  \n- **Overall:** Benign, informational snippet.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Confirmed. Static version assignment with no issues.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are 0, reasonable.  \n- **Overall:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Confirmed. Same as above, straightforward version string.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Appropriate at 0.5 or below for malware/security risk, but currently 0, which is acceptable.  \n- **Overall:** Benign.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Confirmed. Purely informational, no issues.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Correctly set to 0 for malware and risk.  \n- **Overall:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Confirmed. Simple version declaration with licensing comments.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Appropriate at 0.5 or below, currently 0.  \n- **Overall:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** All are 0, as there is no security risk in static metadata.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the consistent pattern and lack of any suspicious activity, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this code as benign, with no malicious or security issues. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.",
