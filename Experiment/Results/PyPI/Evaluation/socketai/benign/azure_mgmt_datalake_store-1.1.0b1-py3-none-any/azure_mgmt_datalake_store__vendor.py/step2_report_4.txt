  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is standard utility functions with no malicious behavior, noting the URL formatting handles missing keys gracefully.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's straightforward nature, the low security risk score seems appropriate. The malware score of 0 is justified, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing benign utility functions with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** Correct, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also finds the code benign, with some note on the unconventional URL component removal, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk score, possibly due to unconventional URL handling, but no evidence of actual security issues.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Notes potential inefficiency or flawed logic but no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** The code is utility functions with no malicious intent; the minor logic flaw does not increase security risk.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, no malicious activity, standard utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is straightforward and generated.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable given the unconventional URL handling, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** Given the unconventional URL handling, a small risk score of 0.1-0.2 is justified, but not higher.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the unusual URL component removal logic, but not a security issue)\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard SDK utility code with no malicious intent. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate. The minor unconventional URL handling does not constitute a security risk but warrants a slight caution, reflected in a low risk score.",
