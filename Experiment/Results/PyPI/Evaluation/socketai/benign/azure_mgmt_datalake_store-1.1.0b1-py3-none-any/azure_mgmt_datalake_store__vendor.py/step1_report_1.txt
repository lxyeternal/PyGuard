  "purpose": "Utility functions for HTTP request manipulation and URL formatting, likely used in a larger Azure SDK component.",
  "sources": "request.content, request.method, request.url, request.headers, request (parameter), files (parameter), template, kwargs",
  "sinks": "HttpRequest constructor, request.set_formdata_body",
  "flows": "request.content (source) -> HttpRequest (sink); template (source) -> string formatting (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code uses standard SDK patterns. The URL formatting function handles missing keys gracefully but could be misused for formatting errors, though not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two utility functions: one for converting a request object possibly with files into an HttpRequest, and another for formatting URL templates with provided parameters. The request conversion handles form data when files are present, otherwise uses request content. The URL formatter splits the template, attempts to format with kwargs, and removes components if formatting raises KeyError, retrying until successful. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. Functions perform standard operations in SDK request building.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard SDK utility functions for request processing and URL formatting. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not exhibit suspicious patterns.",
