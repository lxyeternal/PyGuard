  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists of utility functions for request handling and URL formatting.\n- No reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- The functions perform standard SDK operations, with some noting unconventional URL component removal logic during formatting.\n- The malware score across all reports is 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- The URL formatting function's exception handling is unconventional but not malicious; it attempts to skip missing placeholders by removing URL components, which might be inefficient but safe.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The URL formatting function's loop logic appears flawed or inefficient. It splits the template repeatedly and removes components containing missing keys, which could lead to incorrect URL formation or infinite loops if not carefully managed.\n- The approach for handling missing keys is somewhat unorthodox; a more standard method would be to use default values or skip formatting errors altogether.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the lack of vulnerabilities.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 in all reports, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No issues justify a risk score higher than 0.1; the code is standard utility code with no security vulnerabilities.\n- The only potential concern is the URL formatting logic, but it’s not malicious—just possibly inefficient or flawed.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Confirmed as 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all assessments correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The unconventional URL component removal is not malicious but could be optimized.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**.\n- The **security risk score** should stay low, around **0.1**, reflecting minor inefficiencies but no security issues.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains **0**.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (due to the unconventional URL handling logic)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is standard SDK utility functions with no malicious intent. The only noteworthy point is the URL formatting's error handling, which could be improved but does not pose a security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the code is safe and well-understood.",
