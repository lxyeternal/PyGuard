  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting HTTP request objects and formatting URL templates with provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Request content, request headers, URL template string, and formatting parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data into critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input request object and URL parameters flow into request construction and URL formatting functions, with no external untrusted data flow into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional handling in `_format_url_section` where missing placeholders lead to removal of URL segments containing those placeholders; this approach is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard SDK utility functions for request manipulation and URL formatting. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The URL formatting function's method of removing URL segments with missing keys is unconventional and could lead to malformed URLs, but it does not introduce security vulnerabilities. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1) due to the unconventional URL handling, which is not malicious but could be optimized. Overall, the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The unconventional URL formatting approach is a minor inefficiency, not a security concern. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
