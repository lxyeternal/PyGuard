{
  "purpose": "The code is for managing and listing Data Lake Store operations via Azure SDK, including request building, error handling, and response deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input sources include method parameters, headers, and query parameters; data is read from kwargs, headers, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests and responses to Azure endpoints, potential error handling via map_error, and data deserialization.",
  "flows": "Parameters are assembled into an HTTP request, sent through the Azure pipeline, responses are checked and deserialized, with error mapping applied if necessary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Error handling and request construction follow standard Azure SDK practices.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs HTTP requests for listing operations, handles errors via a predefined map, and deserializes responses. All data flows from input parameters to HTTP requests and responses without any suspicious manipulation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. Usage of standard Azure SDK components and error handling indicates typical implementation behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate part of an Azure SDK for Data Lake Store, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It performs typical request building, error handling, and response processing without anomalies or security issues.",
