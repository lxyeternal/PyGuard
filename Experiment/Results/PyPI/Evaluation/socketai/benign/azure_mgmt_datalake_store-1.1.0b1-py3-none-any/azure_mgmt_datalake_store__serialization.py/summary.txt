  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK utility with no malicious payloads or sabotage. The primary security concern is the use of eval() for type conversions, which could be exploited if input data is malicious. No obfuscation or malicious activity is detected. The overall security risk is moderate due to eval(), but no active threat or payload is present. Refactoring eval() to safer alternatives is recommended."
