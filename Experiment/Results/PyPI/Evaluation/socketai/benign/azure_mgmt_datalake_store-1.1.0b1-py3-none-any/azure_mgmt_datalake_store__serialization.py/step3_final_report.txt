  "purpose": "Provides serialization and deserialization utilities for REST API data formats including JSON, XML, date/time, base64, and model objects, supporting SDK request/response handling.",
  "sources": "Input data from HTTP responses, streams, headers, and models; data is read, parsed, and transformed into models or output formats.",
  "sinks": "Deserialized data assigned to models, serialized data sent over network, or returned as JSON/XML structures.",
  "flows": "Raw input flows into deserialization functions, then into models or output formats; data from models flows into serialization functions for requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() for dynamic type conversion in serialize_basic() and deserialize_basic(), which can execute arbitrary code if input is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code employs eval() to convert string type names ('int', 'float', etc.) into actual Python types during serialization/deserialization. While eval() simplifies dynamic type handling, it introduces a significant security risk if input data is untrusted or manipulated. No malicious payloads or backdoors are evident; the code is standard SDK utility code. The controlled use of eval() limits risk but does not eliminate it. Other functions handle data encoding, XML parsing, and model instantiation securely. The main concern is the potential for code execution via crafted input data influencing eval().",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK utility with no malicious payloads or sabotage. The primary security concern is the use of eval() for type conversions, which could be exploited if input data is malicious. No obfuscation or malicious activity is detected. The overall security risk is moderate due to eval(), but no active threat or payload is present. Refactoring eval() to safer alternatives is recommended.",
