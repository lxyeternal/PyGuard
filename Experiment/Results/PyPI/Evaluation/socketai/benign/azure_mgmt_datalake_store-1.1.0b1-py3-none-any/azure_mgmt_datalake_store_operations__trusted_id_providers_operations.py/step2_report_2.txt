  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the code's security posture, scores, and potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages Azure Data Lake Store trusted ID providers via SDK functions. It serializes inputs, constructs URLs from static templates + sanitized parameters, and handles responses. No malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. The code is standard SDK pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Given the thorough analysis, these scores are appropriate. The low security risk reflects the code's nature as SDK resource management.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on request building, serialization, and standard SDK patterns. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code's purpose and structure are typical for Azure SDK clients, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SDK client for Azure resource management, with request construction, serialization, and response handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — still low, considering the nature of the code.\n- **Justification:** No malicious indicators. Slightly higher risk score might reflect general SDK interaction with network resources, but still minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard SDK pattern, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is a typical auto-generated SDK client, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard SDK code, no malicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — fitting.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the straightforward, generated SDK pattern.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied, mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting minimal security risk inherent in SDK code that interacts with external services but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the scores provided. The code is legitimate SDK code for Azure resource management, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the low security threat, standard implementation, and absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is safe, standard SDK code with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk is minimal, primarily due to the network interactions inherent in SDKs, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
