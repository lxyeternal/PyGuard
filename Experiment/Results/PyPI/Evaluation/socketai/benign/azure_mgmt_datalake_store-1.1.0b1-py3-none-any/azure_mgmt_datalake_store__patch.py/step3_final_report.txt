{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a template for customizing SDK behavior, allowing users to add their own modifications in the 'patch_sdk' function.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it contains only static comments, import statements, and an empty list.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is static with no runtime data movement or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static SDK customization scaffold with no dynamic or external data handling. It contains only licensing comments, an import, an empty __all__ list, and a placeholder function 'patch_sdk'. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are detected. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's purpose is explicitly for user customization, with no active logic or external interactions. The overall assessment confirms the code is safe, with high confidence, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK template with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent. The final scores are malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
