  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward SDK customization template.\n   - It contains no dynamic or external input handling.\n   - The `patch_sdk()` function is a placeholder, intended for user modifications.\n   - No code execution, data processing, or external communication occurs.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies:**\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code is static, with no hidden or obfuscated logic.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, external data, or dangerous constructs are present.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified because there's no data handling, external communication, or execution of untrusted code.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough.\n   - The purpose of the code as a template or scaffold is clearly benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not contain any.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional Comments:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe SDK template with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI agree with the existing scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
