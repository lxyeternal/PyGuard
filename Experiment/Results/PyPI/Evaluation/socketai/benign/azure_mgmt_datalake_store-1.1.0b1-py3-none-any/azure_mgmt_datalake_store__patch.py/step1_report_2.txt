{
  "purpose": "This code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, specifically allowing users to modify or patch the SDK behavior via the `patch_sdk` function.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the `typing.List` import and the `__all__` variable declaration, which defines public interface objects.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present. The code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from source to sink as the code contains only declarations and a function stub with no operational code.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes only boilerplate and comments. The `patch_sdk` function is a placeholder intended for user customization, but contains no malicious or suspicious logic. No unusual language features, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal template for SDK customization, including a copyright notice, licensing information, import statements, a `__all__` declaration, and an empty function meant for user modifications. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable logic beyond the function stub. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident, and the structure aligns with typical SDK extension patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign template for SDK customization with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely offers a placeholder function for user modifications, with no harmful or suspicious content.",
