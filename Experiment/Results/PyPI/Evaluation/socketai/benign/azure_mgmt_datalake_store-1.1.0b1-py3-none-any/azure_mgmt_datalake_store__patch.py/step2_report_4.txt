  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, benign template for SDK customization.\n- No external input, data processing, or communication is present.\n- The code contains only standard imports, a placeholder function, and comments.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The security risk is rated as 0, which seems appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious code, hidden behaviors, or obfuscated patterns.\n- The purpose is clearly to serve as a scaffold for user customization, with no active logic.\n- The sources, sinks, and flows are all static and safe.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they correctly identify the code as a benign template.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary in the scoring or conclusions based on the provided analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe SDK customization template.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nNo further action or adjustment is needed. The reports are accurate, and the code is safe.",
