  "purpose": "The code appears to be a template or scaffold for customizing an SDK, likely generated by an Azure SDK code generator, intended to allow users to add custom modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains static definitions and a placeholder function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to a data leak or malicious action.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code does not process any input or produce output.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual code, hidden behaviors, or obfuscated patterns. The only potentially suspicious element is the placeholder function meant for customization, but it is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, well-structured template with licensing information and a function intended for user customization. It does not include any malicious code, dynamic execution, or security-sensitive operations. Its purpose is to serve as a scaffold for further modifications, with no active behavior or data handling. No anomalies, malware, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template for SDK customization, with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a standard, safe scaffold intended for user extension.",
