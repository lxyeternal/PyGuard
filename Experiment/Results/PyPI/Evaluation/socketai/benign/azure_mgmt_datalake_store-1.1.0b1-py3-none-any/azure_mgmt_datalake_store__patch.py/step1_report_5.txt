{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a template or stub for customizing generated SDK code, likely for Azure SDKs, allowing user modifications via the 'patch_sdk' function.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from standard module imports, type annotations, and comments; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points, such as network connections or file writes, are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is primarily static with no data processing or execution flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious constructs; it is a straightforward template with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal, standard template with licensing and copyright information, import statements, a list for public objects, and a function for SDK patching. It does not include any code that could execute or perform malicious actions. There are no signs of obfuscation, external data handling, or dangerous behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for customizing generated SDK code, with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a placeholder for user modifications and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
