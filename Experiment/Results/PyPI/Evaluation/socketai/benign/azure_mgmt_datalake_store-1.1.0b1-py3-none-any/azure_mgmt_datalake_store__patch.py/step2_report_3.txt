  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward template for SDK customization.\n   - It includes licensing comments, an import statement (`from typing import List`), an empty `__all__` list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()`.\n   - The function `patch_sdk()` is intended for user customization and contains no logic.\n   - No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external input/output is present.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n2. **Evaluation of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, a standard SDK template, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is static, with no data flows or sinks.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate; there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is justified; the code is benign and intended for safe user customization.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The only \"suspicious\" element might be the placeholder `patch_sdk()` function, but this is explicitly intended for user modifications and poses no inherent risk.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign, boilerplate SDK template.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Based on the code and reports, I agree with the current assessments.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe SDK template with no malicious or security concerns.",
