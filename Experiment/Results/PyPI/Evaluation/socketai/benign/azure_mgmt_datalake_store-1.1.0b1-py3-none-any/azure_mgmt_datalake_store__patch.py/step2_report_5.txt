  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal, well-structured template for SDK customization.\n- It contains no dynamic code, no external input handling, no data processing, and no network or file I/O.\n- All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only potentially suspicious element is the placeholder function `patch_sdk()`, which is benign and intended for user customization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of the code itself:** The code is straightforward and matches the description of an SDK customization scaffold.\n- **Malicious activity or malware:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n- **Data flows:** None, as the code does not process or transmit data.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Review:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a benign template.\n- The reasoning that the placeholder function `patch_sdk()` is harmless is sound.\n- The reports consistently classify the code as safe, with a confidence level of 1.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Overall risk score:** 0, justified by the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The reports are thorough and align with the code's simplicity.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all claims are based on static code analysis.\n- The code's purpose is explicitly for customization, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, benign SDK template with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements. It poses no risk and is safe for use.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a safe, minimal scaffold for SDK customization, with no malicious or suspicious features. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
