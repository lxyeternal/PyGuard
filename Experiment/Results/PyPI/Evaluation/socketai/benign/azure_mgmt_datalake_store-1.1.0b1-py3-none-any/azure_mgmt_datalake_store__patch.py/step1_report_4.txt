{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a template or boilerplate for customizing SDK code, with no specific functional logic implemented.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read; only module imports and comments are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or output operations, especially no untrusted data handling or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving external data or sensitive operations is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments, import statements, and a placeholder function with no logic. No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal template intended for SDK customization, containing no executable logic or data handling. It imports typing for type annotations, defines an empty list for public objects, and a placeholder function 'patch_sdk' meant for future customization. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The comments indicate it is a standard Microsoft SDK template. Overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, non-functional template for SDK customization. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks.",
