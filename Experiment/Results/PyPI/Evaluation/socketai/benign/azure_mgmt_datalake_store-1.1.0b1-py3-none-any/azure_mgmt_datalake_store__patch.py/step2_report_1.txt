  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the claims and ensure consistency.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a minimal template for SDK customization, with no dynamic or external data handling.\n- No input/output, network communication, or data processing is present.\n- The only function, `patch_sdk()`, is a placeholder intended for user customization.\n- The code contains no obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs.\n- All reports agree on benign intent, with a confidence of 1 and zero malware, obfuscated code, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious elements. It is a boilerplate template.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic or reasoning:**  \n  No logical errors are evident. The code's purpose is clear, and the analysis in each report aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Correctly 0. No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Correctly 0. No obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Correctly 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n- **Justification for high scores (>0.5):**  \n  None are necessary here. The code is a standard SDK template.\n\n- **Potential assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  All claims are based on the static, non-executable nature of the code. No assumptions about hidden vulnerabilities are warranted.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and recommendations:\n\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed in scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' conclusions: **the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.**  \nMy own estimates for the scores would be:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured SDK customization template with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
