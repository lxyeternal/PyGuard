  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment setup, dependency checks, and configuration of optimizers and schedulers in a PyTorch training pipeline.",
  "sources": "Dependency check functions (importlib.util.find_spec), environment variables (os.environ), configuration parameters, and model/optimizer initializations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Dependency checks and environment variable modifications influence environment setup; dynamic imports influence optimizer/scheduler creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment detection, configuration, and setup routines common in ML training pipelines. Use of importlib for optional modules and dynamic attribute access is typical. Environment variables are manipulated for hardware configuration, which is standard practice. No untrusted data, network activity, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to best practices. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate setup and utility code for PyTorch training environments, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The existing scores are appropriate and align with the detailed analysis.",
