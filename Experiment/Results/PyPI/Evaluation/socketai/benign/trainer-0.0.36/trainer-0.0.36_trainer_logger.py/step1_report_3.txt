  "purpose": "Configure a logger for outputting log messages to the standard stream with a custom (empty) format.",
  "sources": "Code initializes and sets up the logger, stream handler, and formatter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Logger receives log messages, which are formatted by the formatter and output via the stream handler.",
  "anomalies": "Using an empty formatter string may produce logs with no visible content, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a logging StreamHandler and sets an empty formatter, which results in logs being sent to stdout with no message content. The logger named 'trainer' is configured at INFO level with propagation disabled. No data is read from external sources or user input. There are no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The configuration is somewhat atypical but harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup with an unusual formatter configuration. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
