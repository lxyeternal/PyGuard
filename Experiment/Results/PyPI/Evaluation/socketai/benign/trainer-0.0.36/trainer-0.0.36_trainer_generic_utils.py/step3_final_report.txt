  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment info, filesystem management, git info retrieval, and model parameter handling in ML workflows.",
  "sources": "subprocess calls for git info, filesystem globbing and existence checks, torch tensors, environment variables, and external filesystem via fsspec",
  "sinks": "filesystem operations (delete, glob), subprocess outputs used for environment info, torch tensor operations, logging",
  "flows": "subprocess outputs (git branch, commit hash) used for experiment folder naming; filesystem checks for cleanup; tensor operations for model handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code; subprocess calls are standard for info retrieval; filesystem deletions are conditional and logged",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ML experiment management tasks: retrieving git info, managing filesystem directories, counting model parameters, updating averages. No suspicious data flows or malicious activity detected. Filesystem operations are conditional and justified. Subprocess calls are controlled and used for environment info. No obfuscation or secrets present. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified by filesystem cleanup operations, which are standard but could be misused if misconfigured. All malware scores are zero, consistent with benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility code for ML workflows with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are appropriate and justified given the operations performed.",
