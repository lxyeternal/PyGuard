  "purpose": "Utility functions for machine learning experiment management, including Git info retrieval, device setup, experiment folder handling, model parameter counting, and a class for maintaining moving averages.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, filesystem, subprocess outputs (git commands), and input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess commands for Git, filesystem operations (os, fsspec), and potentially untrusted inputs in function parameters.",
  "flows": "Function calls to subprocess check_output → output parsed or used for filesystem paths, folder deletion, or info logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The subprocess calls do not sanitize outputs, but are standard for git info retrieval. No suspicious obfuscated code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of utility functions typical for experiment management and model training workflows. It calls external processes for Git info, handles filesystem operations, and manages model state and parameters. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns such as data exfiltration, network communication, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. The subprocess calls are used for retrieving version control info, which is common. File deletion is conditional on the presence of checkpoint files, which is standard. The code does not include any hardcoded credentials, network requests to external servers, or other malicious behaviors. No suspicious data flows or anomalies were detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility code for experiment management in a machine learning context. No malicious intent or malicious behavior signals are present. It functions as intended for standard experiment workflows without security concerns.",
