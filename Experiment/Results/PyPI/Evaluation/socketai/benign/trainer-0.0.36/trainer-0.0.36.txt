      "conclusion": "The script is a typical distributed training launcher that executes external scripts based on user input without validation. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential for command injection if inputs are malicious. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The moderate security risk score reflects the lack of input validation. Implementing input validation would mitigate this risk, but as it stands, the code is not malicious."
