  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign callback management class with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only potential security risk stems from external callbacks, which is typical and outside the code's control. Scores are consistent with this analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a low security risk score (~0.2)."
