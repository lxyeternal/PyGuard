{
  "purpose": "The code reads a version string from a file named 'VERSION' and assigns it to a module-level variable.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "File read operation flows from disk to the variable 'version', then to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures or obfuscated code. The import statements are standard, but they import potentially large modules ('trainer.model' and 'trainer.trainer') without context, which could be a concern if these modules contain malicious code. However, the current code snippet does not include malicious behavior itself.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a version number from a file named 'VERSION' in its directory, which is a common practice for version control. The imported modules could potentially contain malicious code, but there is no evidence of malicious activity within this snippet. The code performs simple file I/O and assignments, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing standard version file reading and module imports. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this snippet. The only consideration is the imported modules, which are external and could contain malicious code outside this snippet's scope.",
