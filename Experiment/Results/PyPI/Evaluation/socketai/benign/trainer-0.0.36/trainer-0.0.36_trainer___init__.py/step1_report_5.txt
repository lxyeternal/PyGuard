{
  "purpose": "Load version information from a VERSION file and import modules related to training models and trainers.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing beyond reading a file.",
  "flows": "File reading operation flows into the 'version' variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. Import statements are standard, and reading a version file is typical for version management.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules from a trainer package, then reads a 'VERSION' file in the same directory to assign its content to __version__. No untrusted input, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The file read is straightforward and safe; no malicious code or data leakage is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard and appears safe. It loads version info and imports modules without any malicious intent or security risks.",
