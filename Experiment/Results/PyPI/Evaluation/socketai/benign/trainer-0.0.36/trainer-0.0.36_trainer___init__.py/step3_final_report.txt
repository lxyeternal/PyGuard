  "purpose": "Load version information from a local VERSION file and import modules from trainer package.",
  "sources": "Reading the VERSION file in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "File read operation assigns content to __version__; imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file I/O and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple, standard operations: importing modules and reading a local version file. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The imported modules could contain malicious code outside this snippet, but within this code, no malicious behavior is evident. The file reading is safe and typical for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scoring of malware and security risk should be set to 0.",
