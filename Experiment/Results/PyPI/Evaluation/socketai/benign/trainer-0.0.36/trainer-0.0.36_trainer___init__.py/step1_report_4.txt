  "purpose": "Load the version information from a file named 'VERSION' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "Reading from the file system via open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"VERSION\"), \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\")",
  "sinks": "Assigning file content to the variable 'version' and setting __version__",
  "flows": "File read source -> variable 'version' -> setting __version__",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard file read operation",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules from 'trainer', then reads a file named 'VERSION' in the same directory, assigning its contents to the '__version__' variable. The process is straightforward, using standard Python file I/O without any data processing or external interactions. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, legitimate operation of reading version info from a local file. No malicious activity or security issues are present based on this code snippet.",
