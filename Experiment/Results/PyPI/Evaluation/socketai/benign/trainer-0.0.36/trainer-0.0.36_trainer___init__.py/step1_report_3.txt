{
  "purpose": "The code reads the content of a VERSION file and assigns it to the __version__ variable, likely for version control purposes within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reading the VERSION file from the same directory as the script using open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'VERSION')).",
  "targets": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the data read from the VERSION file is stored in a variable and not used in further suspicious actions within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input source (reading VERSION file) -> storing data in 'version' -> assigning to '__version__'. No further processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, simply reading a file.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules from a package, reads a VERSION file located relative to its directory, and assigns its contents to __version__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be a typical version loading snippet. No external data is being sent or processed in a harmful manner. The imports suggest integration with larger modules, but do not raise security concerns themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears benign. It solely reads a version string from a file and assigns it to a variable. There are no malicious behaviors or security issues detected.",
