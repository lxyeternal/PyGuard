  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the specified Python package 'eyes-selenium'.",
  "sources": "Import statements and function calls to obtain package version info from system metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; code only reads package metadata, does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "The function calls import system functions to get package version; no external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard library functions for version retrieval; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to get the version of a package, with compatibility for different Python versions. It imports standard modules (importlib.metadata or pkg_resources) based on availability, and retrieves the package version. No external network, file system, or user input interactions are present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version retrieval utility using standard Python modules, with no malicious intent or security risks observed.",
