  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'eyes-selenium' package using importlib.metadata or pkg_resources depending on Python version.",
  "sources": "Input: package_name parameter ('eyes-selenium')",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing version information; potentially used elsewhere in the application",
  "flows": "Input ('eyes-selenium') -> version retrieval functions -> return version string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard approach to get package version, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to obtain the version of a specified package, using different modules based on Python version. It imports necessary modules dynamically within try-except blocks, which is standard for compatibility. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor is data sent elsewhere. The code performs a benign function without side effects or malicious behavior. There are no obfuscated elements, no code injection, and no suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation for retrieving a package version with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
