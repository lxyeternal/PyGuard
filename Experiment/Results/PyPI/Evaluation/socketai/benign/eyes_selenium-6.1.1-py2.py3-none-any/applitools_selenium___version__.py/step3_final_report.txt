  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of a specified Python package, supporting both Python >=3.9 and older versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'importlib.metadata.version' and 'pkg_resources.get_distribution', which access package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads package metadata and does not process untrusted input or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Input package name passed to '_version' function, which then calls either 'version()' or 'get_distribution().version' to retrieve version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility to fetch package version info, compatible across Python versions. It uses standard libraries without any malicious or suspicious patterns. No network activity, data leaks, or code execution of untrusted data occurs. The logic is clear, and the implementation is correct. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's behavior. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for retrieving package version information. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
