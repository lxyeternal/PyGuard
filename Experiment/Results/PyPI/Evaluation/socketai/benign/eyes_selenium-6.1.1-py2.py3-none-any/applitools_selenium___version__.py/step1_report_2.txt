{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the specified Python package ('eyes-selenium') using importlib.metadata or pkg_resources depending on Python version.",
  "sources": "The package_name parameter in the _version function, and the import statements for importlib.metadata and pkg_resources.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the version string, which could be used elsewhere; however, no direct sink for untrusted data or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "flows": "Input: package_name ('eyes-selenium') → Source: version retrieval functions → Output: __version__ with the package version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward and relies on standard library functions for package version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to fetch the version of a specific package ('eyes-selenium') by first trying importlib.metadata (preferred in Python >=3.9), falling back to pkg_resources for older versions. Both methods are standard for retrieving package version info. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The code does not perform any network operations, execute untrusted code, or handle sensitive data beyond fetching package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard package version retrieval utility without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators.",
