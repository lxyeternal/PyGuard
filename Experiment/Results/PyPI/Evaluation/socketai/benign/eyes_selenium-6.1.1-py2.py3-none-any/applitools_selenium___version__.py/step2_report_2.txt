  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code is a standard implementation for retrieving package version info, compatible with different Python versions.\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present.\n   - The function simply imports standard modules and returns the version string.\n   - The assigned malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - The security risk is 0, as the code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are apparent.\n   - The code handles different Python versions gracefully.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as safe and standard.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - Malware: 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated: 0 is correct.\n   - Security risk: 0 is justified.\n   - Confidence: 1, given the straightforward nature.\n\n4. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about malicious activity are warranted here.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or code execution beyond standard package metadata access.\n\n5. **Overall assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign utility for version retrieval.\n   - All reports are consistent in their evaluation and scoring.\n   - No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No further action or concern is necessary.",
