  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a function `_version(package_name)` that retrieves the version of a specified Python package.\n- It uses `importlib.metadata.version()` if available (Python >=3.9), otherwise falls back to `pkg_resources.get_distribution()`.\n- It then assigns the version of `\"eyes-selenium\"` to `__version__`.\n\n**Security Implications:**\n- The code only reads package metadata; it does not write, transmit, or execute untrusted code.\n- It does not handle user input beyond the static package name, nor does it involve network operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The purpose is straightforward: retrieving package version info.\n\n**Review of Each Report:**\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify the code's purpose and methods.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are observed.\n- The confidence level is high (1), and the malware score is 0 in all reports.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity or code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- Given the simplicity and safety of the code, no adjustments to scores are necessary.\n- The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign utility for package version retrieval, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward, using standard Python libraries.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n- Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll scores align with the code's behavior.",
