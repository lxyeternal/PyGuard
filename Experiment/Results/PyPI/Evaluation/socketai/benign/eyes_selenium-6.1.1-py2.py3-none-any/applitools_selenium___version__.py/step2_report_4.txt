  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward implementation to retrieve the version of the 'eyes-selenium' package.\n   - The code uses standard Python libraries (`importlib.metadata` for Python >=3.9 and `pkg_resources` for older versions).\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious code are detected across all reports.\n   - The code is simple, readable, and adheres to common practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, indicating no risk.\n   - The code performs a read-only operation to fetch package metadata.\n   - No reason to elevate the risk score; the current scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious activity detected.\n   - The code does not execute untrusted code, send data externally, or perform any harmful actions.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports base their conclusions on the actual code behavior, not assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code's intent and function.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard utility to retrieve package version info.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and well-justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe and does not pose any security threat.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.",
