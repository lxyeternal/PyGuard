  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility to retrieve the version of the 'eyes-selenium' package using standard Python libraries. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code is simple, well-understood, and uses accepted practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code:\n- Handles different Python versions.\n- Uses standard library functions.\n- Does not perform any network activity or handle sensitive data.\n- Is free from obfuscation or malicious code.\n\nNo logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**  \nSince all scores are 0, there's no need to justify higher scores. The code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports base their conclusions on factual analysis, not assumptions. They correctly interpret the code's intent and behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the thorough, consistent reports, I concur with the provided scores. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's actual behavior.",
