{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export classes and functions related to Selenium-based visual testing settings and regions, used for web UI testing automation.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries ('applitools' and local modules), specifically importing classes related to regions and check settings.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks. The code mainly consists of import statements and __all__ definition.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input. The code simply re-exports imported classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code is standard module export structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from external and internal modules related to visual testing. It defines an __all__ list for module exports, which is standard practice. No dynamic execution, no input handling, and no sensitive data processing are present. The code appears to serve as a simple module setup without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that imports and re-exports classes for visual testing configurations. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It is standard boilerplate code for organizing exports in a Python package.",
