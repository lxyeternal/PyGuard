  "purpose": "This code appears to set up imports and exports for a testing or automation framework related to visual testing with Applitools and Selenium.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from 'applitools.common' and local modules within the package ('.selenium_check_settings', '.target')",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no external system calls or data leaks are present",
  "flows": "The code imports dependencies and re-exports classes, no data flow or untrusted input handling occurs here",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from external libraries and local modules, then defines the __all__ variable to specify public API components. It contains no executable logic, no data handling, and no signs of malicious activity. The code structure and imports appear standard for a modular testing framework setup.",
  "conclusion": "This module solely manages imports and exports, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected. It is a typical setup code for organizing package components.",
