{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class 'Eyes' for managing visual testing configurations and capabilities within the Applitools SDK, including setting capabilities for mobile and NMG platforms and retrieving execution URLs.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules and libraries; reads environment variables using get_env_with_prefix; accesses class attributes and static methods; reads input parameters such as api_key, server_url, proxy_settings; reads environment variables and class properties.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.dumps() for serializing environment configurations; constructs URLs and command execution results; raises exceptions for missing API keys; accesses environment variables and class attributes; manipulates configuration dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (api_key, server_url, proxy_settings) flow into environment variable retrieval and configuration setup; environment variables influence the formation of capabilities; capability configurations flow into command execution and environment setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. The code handles environment variables securely and constructs configuration data without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured and typical for SDK configuration management. It retrieves sensitive information such as API keys from environment variables securely, uses standard JSON serialization for platform-specific capabilities, and interacts with external command execution components. No code segments suggest malicious activity like data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The functions mainly focus on configuring SDK capabilities and environment variables without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and safe, primarily handling configuration and capability setup for visual testing within the SDK. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. All operations are standard and align with typical SDK implementation patterns.",
