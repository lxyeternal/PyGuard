  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK configuration class with no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious intent. The use of environment variables and external SDK components is standard. The minor security risk stems from potential misconfiguration if inputs are malicious, but this is typical for such code and does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
