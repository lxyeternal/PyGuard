  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** All reports describe code that manages configuration for Applitools Eyes SDK, including environment variable retrieval, capability setup for mobile and NMG, and interaction with external components like CommandExecutor and ProxySettings.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from environment variables and function parameters into configuration dictionaries and command arguments, often serialized via json.dumps. These are typical for SDK setup routines.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected across all reports. The code's primary function is configuration management, with standard use of environment variables and external SDK components.\n\n- **Conclusions:** All reports agree that the code is legitimate, safe, and typical for SDK configuration purposes, with no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Critical Evaluation:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - None of the reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n   - The code relies on environment variables, which is standard practice.\n   - No code injection, remote code execution, or network exfiltration is evident.\n\n2. **Potential Risks:**\n   - The main concern is the use of untrusted input in environment variable setup and JSON serialization, which could be exploited if inputs are maliciously crafted.\n   - However, this is typical for configuration code and does not constitute malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Obfuscation & Anomalies:**\n   - No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code contains unimplemented properties raising NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete interface but not malicious.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - Malware scores are consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risks are low (~0.2), mainly due to potential misconfiguration or untrusted input handling, not malicious intent.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**, as code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.2), reflecting typical configuration risks, but not indicating malicious intent.\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate SDK configuration class with no signs of malware or obfuscation.** The main concern is proper validation of inputs to prevent misconfiguration, but this does not constitute a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimates:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**             | **0**                | **0.2**     |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious behavior. No further action is necessary beyond standard security best practices for handling untrusted input.",
