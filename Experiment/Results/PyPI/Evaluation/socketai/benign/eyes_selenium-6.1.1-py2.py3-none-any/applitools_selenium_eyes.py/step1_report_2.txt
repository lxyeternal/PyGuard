{
  "purpose": "This code defines the 'Eyes' class for interacting with Applitools' visual testing SDK, including setting up capabilities for mobile and NMG configurations, and managing various properties and methods related to visual test execution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (via get_env_with_prefix), function parameters (api_key, eyes_server_url, proxy_settings), and method calls (ProxySettings.from_env, CommandExecutor.get_instance).",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include setting environment variables and configuration dictionaries (caps), constructing JSON strings for Android intent arguments, and potentially making network calls via CommandExecutor.",
  "flows": "Flow paths include reading environment variables or function parameters (sources), processing and updating configuration dictionaries, and setting environment variables or command arguments (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are directly visible; environment variable access is standard. No backdoors, obfuscated code, or hidden network activity is present. Use of string formatting for JSON dumps appears standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages configuration settings for visual testing using environment variables and function parameters, with no apparent malicious behavior. Functions perform typical setup tasks for SDK configuration, including environment variable access, JSON formatting, and setting environment-specific arguments. No data exfiltration, malicious network communication, or backdoors are evident. The code follows standard patterns for SDK setup and capability configuration, with appropriate error handling for missing API keys. The code appears to be a legitimate part of an SDK, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK configuration class with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It securely manages environment variables and configuration settings without engaging in any malicious actions.",
