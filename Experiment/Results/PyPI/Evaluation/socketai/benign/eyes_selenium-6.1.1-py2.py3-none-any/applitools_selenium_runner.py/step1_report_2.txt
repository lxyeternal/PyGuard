{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and imports for a visual testing SDK, specifically for managing different types of runners (Classic and Visual Grid) and related utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (`applitools.common.runner`, `.protocol`) and the class definitions themselves.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "The code sets class attributes and protocols; it does not process external input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The class attributes `BASE_AGENT_ID` appear to be identifiers for SDK components, not secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class inheritance and module imports. It defines two classes (`ClassicRunner` and `VisualGridRunner`) that extend existing SDK classes. It assigns static identifiers and protocol classes. There are no input handling, data processing, or output operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident. The code adheres to typical SDK structure, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard SDK setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as an interface for visual testing runners. There are no indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious behavior.",
