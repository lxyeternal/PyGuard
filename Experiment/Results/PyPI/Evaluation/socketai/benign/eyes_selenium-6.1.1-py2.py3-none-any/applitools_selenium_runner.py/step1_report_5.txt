{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface for different visual testing runners using the Applitools SDK, providing class definitions and importing necessary components for visual testing workflows.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules (`applitools.common.runner`, `protocol`), class definitions, class attributes, and method calls (none in this snippet).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; no network calls, data handling, or insecure operations are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves defining classes that inherit from external SDK classes and assigning class attributes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; class structures are straightforward. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from the Applitools SDK, defines two subclasses (`ClassicRunner` and `VisualGridRunner`) that set class attributes (`BASE_AGENT_ID`, `Protocol`), and exposes these through `__all__`. It is a typical pattern for SDK wrapper or extension modules. There are no signs of malicious code, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a legitimate SDK interface setup, with no evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign SDK interface extension with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly structures SDK classes for visual testing without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
