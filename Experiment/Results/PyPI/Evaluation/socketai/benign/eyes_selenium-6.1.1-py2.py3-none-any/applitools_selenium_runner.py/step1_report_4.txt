{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up and configure different types of test runners and their associated protocols for a visual testing SDK, likely for automated UI testing with Applitools Eyes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external libraries (applitools.common.runner, .protocol) and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data processing functions are present; the code primarily defines classes and constants.",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> defining classes with attributes -> exposing classes via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes from the 'applitools' SDK and a local protocol module. It defines two classes, ClassicRunner and VisualGridRunner, which inherit from their respective parent classes. Both classes set a BASE_AGENT_ID string for identification and assign a Protocol class, likely for driver interactions, imported from the protocol module. The __all__ attribute explicitly exports these classes and a utility function for session result handling. No data processing, user input handling, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code functions as configuration and class extension, which is standard for SDK setup.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward SDK configuration snippet defining test runner classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly sets class attributes and imports, with no suspicious patterns or potential attack vectors.",
