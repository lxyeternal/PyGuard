  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward class definitions extending SDK classes.\n- They import modules, assign static identifiers, and define class attributes.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- The reports uniformly conclude these are benign SDK setup codes with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Sets up test runners for Applitools SDK.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no data leaks, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is SDK configuration, and no malicious activity is detected. The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate, considering it's part of an SDK setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Defines classes and imports for visual testing SDK.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, and the high confidence score aligns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Defines classes for Eyes Runners with Selenium WebDriver.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Configures visual testing runners.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Interface for visual testing runners.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 0.9, Obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The confidence score is slightly lower but still indicates benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations & Recommendations:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as SDK setup/configuration, with no malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are high, reflecting the reviewers' certainty.\n\n### **Potential Adjustments:**\n- The only minor point is the **risk scores**: since the code is purely SDK configuration, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is justified.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate, given the clear, straightforward code.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the code is benign, and the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified; SDK configuration is safe)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard SDK setup, with no indication of supply chain attack vectors or malicious behavior.",
