{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up and export classes related to different types of test runners for the Applitools visual testing SDK, specifically for Python integrations with Selenium WebDriver.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'applitools.common.runner' and local module '.protocol', class definitions, and constant string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to class definitions, which assign class attributes and inherit behavior. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets (beyond benign identifiers), or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward, importing and extending classes with static identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a known SDK (applitools), defines two subclasses that assign static agent IDs and associate a Protocol class, and exposes these classes via __all__. There are no indications of data manipulation, network activity, or malicious code. The class design follows typical SDK extension patterns. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for SDK class inheritance and configuration. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger SDK, with no evidence of sabotage or harmful actions.",
