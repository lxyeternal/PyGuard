{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for different types of Eyes Runners for visual testing, using a Selenium WebDriver protocol.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility, imports from applitools.common.runner, and local import of SeleniumWebDriver.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is processed or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior detected. The use of __future__ imports and class inheritance appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines two classes inheriting from third-party SDK classes. The classes assign static identifiers and a protocol class. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious patterns. The code's structure suggests it's part of a larger SDK for visual testing, with no malicious intent. The 'log_session_results_and_raise_exception' function is imported but not used, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard SDK class definitions for visual testing; no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is a straightforward, safe code fragment.",
