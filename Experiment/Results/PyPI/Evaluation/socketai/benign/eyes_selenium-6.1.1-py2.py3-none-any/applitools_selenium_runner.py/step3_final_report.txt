{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for visual testing runners and sets static identifiers for SDK components.",
  "sources": "Imports from SDK modules and class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static class definitions and imports only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward class inheritance and static attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions extending SDK classes, with static identifiers and module imports. There are no data inputs, network operations, or secret handling. The code appears to be standard SDK setup code with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with a benign SDK configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK setup with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
