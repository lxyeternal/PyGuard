  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as setting up SDK classes for visual testing.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or untrusted data handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns; static identifiers are benign.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, inheriting classes, setting static agent IDs, and exporting classes. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.  \n- **Confidence & Scores:** High confidence (0.9), malware (0), security risk (0.1). The security risk is minimal, possibly due to the nature of static configuration, but no actual risk is identified.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the standard SDK setup, class inheritance, static identifiers, and no suspicious behavior.  \n- Confidence is even higher (1).  \n- Malware and security risk are zero.  \n**Verdict:** Correct assessment; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Focuses on class definitions and imports, with no data processing or network activity.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- Confidence is high (1).  \n- Malware and security risk are zero.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Reiterates the pattern of SDK class extension, static identifiers, and no data handling or malicious code.  \n- Confidence is 1, malware and security risk are zero.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar to others, highlights class inheritance, static attributes, and absence of data leaks or malicious behavior.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still very high.  \n- Malware and security risk are zero.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports or the code snippets show any signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is purely SDK setup, class inheritance, and static configuration.\n\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or anomalies are detected. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the absence of any malicious or security-sensitive operations, a **malware score of 0** is appropriate. The **security risk score** should also be very low, close to 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n- **Overall Malware & Obfuscated Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (as per reports, but considering the code is benign, this can be lowered to 0)\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a typical SDK extension with static class attributes, inheritance, and no data processing or external communication. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score reflects minimal concern, but given the context, it can be considered negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      |\n| Security Risk    | 0                      |\n\n**This is a benign, standard SDK configuration code with no malicious or security issues.**",
