  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is standard SDK setup code, with no malicious behavior, no data leaks, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The code involves class inheritance, static identifiers, and module imports.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or secret data is present.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), and malware scores are zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets are straightforward class definitions extending SDK classes, assigning static IDs, and importing modules. No anomalies or errors are evident.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns.\n- **Data flow / sinks:** No data processing, input/output, or network activity.\n- **Secrets / credentials:** None present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None based on static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any security concerns, a low score (~0.1) is reasonable, reflecting minimal risk due to the code's role as SDK configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis of Scores:\n\n- The scores seem consistent with the reports' reasoning.\n- The high confidence levels (1 or 0.9) are justified.\n- No report suggests any reason to increase the malware or obfuscated scores.\n- The risk scores are low, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjustments:** No adjustments needed; scores are appropriate.\n- **Additional considerations:** Since the code is purely SDK setup, the risk is inherently low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimate (Post-Review):\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, due to SDK configuration role, but no real security concern)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign SDK setup code with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should remain as they are.",
