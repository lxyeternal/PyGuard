{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and classes from the 'applitools' library, likely to provide testing and visual validation functionalities for applications, and sets up exports for those components.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries ('applitools') and internal module files (__version__ and other local modules).",
  "sinks": "None identified; there are no data writes, network communications, or untrusted data processing in the visible code.",
  "flows": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration, with no data flow or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious constructs are evident in the provided code segment.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports multiple components from the 'applitools' library and a local version identifier, then defines an __all__ list for module exports. There is no logic, data processing, or network activity. No hardcoded credentials, sensitive data, or suspicious behaviors are present. It appears to be a standard module setup for an SDK or library package, designed solely for exposing classes and functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting only of import statements and export declarations. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is likely part of a legitimate SDK or library setup.",
