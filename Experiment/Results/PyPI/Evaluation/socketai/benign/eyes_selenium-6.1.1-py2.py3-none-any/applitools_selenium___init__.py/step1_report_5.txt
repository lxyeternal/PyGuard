{
  "purpose": "This code primarily imports various modules and classes from the 'applitools.common' package and other related local modules, and defines an export list (__all__) for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'applitools.common' package, '__version__' from a local module, and local class and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, external network connections, or sensitive information handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data, as the code is purely import and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code only consists of import statements and a module-level __all__ declaration. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numerous classes, functions, and constants from a well-known and widely-used open-source library (Applitools). It defines the __all__ list for module exports, indicating standard package organization. There are no data processing, user input handling, or network operations that could be exploited or malicious. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python module setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export declaration with no malicious intent, suspicious patterns, or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate, benign part of a Python package setup.",
