  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static import and export module for the Applitools SDK, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is purely import statements and an `__all__` declaration. No dynamic code, no network activity, no data processing, no secrets. The reasoning is sound, and the confidence is high. The malware and security risk scores are appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—imports and exports with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is just module setup. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, straightforward import/export code.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues detected. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—imports and exports only.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo suspicious activity. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard module setup.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static import/export module for the Applitools SDK.\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are zero, which is justified since there's no security risk in static import modules.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks, data leaks, or vulnerabilities evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is standard, benign, and poses no security threat. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
