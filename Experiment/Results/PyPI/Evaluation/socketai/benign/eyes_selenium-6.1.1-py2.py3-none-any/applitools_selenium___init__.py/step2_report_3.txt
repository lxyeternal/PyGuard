  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Importing various modules from 'applitools.common' and local version info.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity, code execution, or untrusted data handling. Purely static imports and exports.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on imports and exports with no suspicious activity.\n- No anomalies or dynamic code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: static imports, no data processing, no network activity.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, just import statements and __all__ declaration.\n- No untrusted data, no dynamic code, no anomalies.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous, purely import/export setup.\n- No suspicious behavior or code execution.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that only imports modules and declares an export list (__all__). There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** The code is static, with no handling of untrusted data or sensitive information, and no external communication.\n- **Confidence Level:** High, as all reports agree and the code is straightforward.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign module that imports and re-exports components of the Applitools SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or changes, but based on this static analysis, the code appears safe.",
