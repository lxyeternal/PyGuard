{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules and classes from the 'applitools.common' package and other local modules, likely setting up an environment for visual testing and automation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from external packages (applitools.common) and local files (__version__, __all__). No direct input reading is evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data destinations that handle untrusted data are apparent. No network, file, or environment variable access is visible in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observable in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code primarily consists of import statements and the definition of __all__.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import and export list. It imports various classes and functions from the 'applitools.common' package and local modules. No data processing, user input, or network interaction is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data leakage. The structure is typical for a Python module defining public API symbols.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module setup for a Python package, exporting specific classes and functions. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code within this fragment.",
