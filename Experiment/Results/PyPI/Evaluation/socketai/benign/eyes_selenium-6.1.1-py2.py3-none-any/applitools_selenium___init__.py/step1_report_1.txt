{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and classes related to the Applitools visual testing SDK, configuring and exposing functionalities for visual validation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from 'applitools.common' package, and a local version import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static imports and module definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static imports of functions, classes, and variables from a well-known SDK related to visual testing. It defines an export list (__all__). There are no functions, data processing, or untrusted data handling. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The structure is straightforward and standard for a module aggregating imports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module that imports and re-exports various components of the Applitools SDK. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for SDK setup code.",
