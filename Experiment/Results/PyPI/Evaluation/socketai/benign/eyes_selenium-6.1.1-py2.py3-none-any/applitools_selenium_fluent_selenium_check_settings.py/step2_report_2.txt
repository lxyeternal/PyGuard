  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code is straightforward class extension code using the 'attr' library, importing classes from 'applitools.common.fluent.web_check_settings', and defining subclasses with no additional logic. There are no functions, data processing, or input/output operations.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is simple class inheritance and configuration setup. They note the absence of data flows, untrusted input handling, or malicious patterns. No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   **Recommendation:** The scores seem reasonable; no change needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely class definitions with no data processing, network activity, or code execution, there's no justification for higher risk scores. The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   The reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.  \n   **Note:** If any report claimed a higher malware score without evidence, that would be suspicious, but they did not.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n- The code is a standard, benign class extension for configuration purposes.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- Scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate after review:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation) or minimal if any)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just standard configuration code)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as safe and non-malicious. No further action or concern is necessary.",
