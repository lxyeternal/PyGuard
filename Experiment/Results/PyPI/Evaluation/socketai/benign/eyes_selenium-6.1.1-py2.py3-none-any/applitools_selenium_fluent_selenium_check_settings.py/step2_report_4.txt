  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - The original code consists solely of class definitions extending existing classes from a third-party library (`applitools.common.fluent.web_check_settings`) using the `attr` library.  \n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors.  \n   - No evidence of malicious code, such as network calls, code execution, or data leaks, is present.  \n   - The code appears to be a straightforward extension for configuration purposes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**  \n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard class extension code with no malicious behavior.  \n   - They note the absence of data flows, sinks, anomalies, or suspicious patterns.  \n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.  \n   - The analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.  \n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   - Since the code shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks, high scores are unwarranted.  \n   - The current scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   - The reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious activity or code.  \n   - This is consistent with the code's content.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they stick to what the code shows.  \n   - They do not infer malicious intent where none exists.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   - The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThis code is purely structural, defining subclasses for configuration purposes in a web automation framework. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute any dynamic code. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No further action needed.",
