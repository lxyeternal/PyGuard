{
  "purpose": "Define classes for Selenium check settings inheriting from WebCheckSettings, likely for configuring visual or web checks in automation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and classes, class inheritance, attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involving untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely class definitions with no dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses standard Python class inheritance with attrs; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines two classes inheriting from existing classes. The classes appear to serve as configuration holders without any data processing, input handling, or external interactions. No malicious patterns, such as network calls, data leaks, or code execution, are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical class definition patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of configuration classes for Selenium check settings. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose seems to be to extend existing settings for a specific use case, with no suspicious or harmful content.",
