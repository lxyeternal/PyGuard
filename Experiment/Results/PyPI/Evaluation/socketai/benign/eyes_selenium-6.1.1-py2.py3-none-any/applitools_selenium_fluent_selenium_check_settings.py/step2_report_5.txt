  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code imports `attr` and classes from `applitools.common.fluent.web_check_settings`.\n   - It defines two classes:\n     - `SeleniumCheckSettingsValues` inheriting from `WebCheckSettingsValues`.\n     - `SeleniumCheckSettings` inheriting from `WebCheckSettings`, with a class attribute `Values` pointing to `SeleniumCheckSettingsValues`.\n   - The code is straightforward, mainly establishing subclasses for configuration purposes.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:\n   - The code contains no input/output operations, no network calls, no data processing, no dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns.\n   - No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.\n   - The purpose appears to be extending existing classes for Selenium-specific settings in a web testing framework.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0, since there's no security risk identified.\n\n4. **Any Issues or Discrepancies**:\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessments; all find the code benign.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the analysis is cautious and appropriate.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk or Malware**:\n   - Given the simplicity and the nature of the code, a higher risk or malware score would be unjustified.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or that are suspicious.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is standard class extension code used in configuration or setup within a larger framework.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code is benign, with no security concerns.",
