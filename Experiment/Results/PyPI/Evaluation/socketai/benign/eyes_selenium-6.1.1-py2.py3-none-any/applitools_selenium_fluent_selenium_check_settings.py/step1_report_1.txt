  "purpose": "Define subclasses for web check settings using the 'attr' library, extending existing classes from 'applitools.common.fluent.web_check_settings'.",
  "sources": "Imports modules: 'attr', and classes from 'applitools.common.fluent.web_check_settings'. No input or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines classes without executing data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed. The code uses standard class inheritance and decorators.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines two classes, 'SeleniumCheckSettingsValues' and 'SeleniumCheckSettings', which extend existing classes from a third-party library. There are no functions, data processing, or input/output operations that could be exploited or indicate malicious behavior. The structure appears standard for class extension and configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward class extension code with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application setup without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
