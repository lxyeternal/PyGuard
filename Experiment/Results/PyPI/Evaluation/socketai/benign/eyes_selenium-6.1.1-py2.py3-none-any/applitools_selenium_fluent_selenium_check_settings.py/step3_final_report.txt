  "purpose": "Define subclasses for Selenium-specific web check settings extending existing framework classes for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'applitools.common.fluent.web_check_settings' and class definitions using 'attr' library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external system interaction present.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance and attribute assignment without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions extending existing classes with no functions, data processing, or dynamic behavior. It uses the 'attr' library for data classes and serves as configuration holders. No network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward extension of configuration classes for a web testing framework. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports accurately reflect this assessment, and no further action is necessary.",
