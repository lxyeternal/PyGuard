{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes related to Selenium check settings, inheriting from web check settings, likely for browser automation or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports from '__future__' for compatibility, and imports 'attr' for class decorations, as well as specific classes from 'applitools.common.fluent.web_check_settings'.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network calls, file operations, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code establishes class inheritance and class attributes, with no data flow involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward class inheritance and decoration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions using the 'attr' library for concise syntax. It imports classes related to web check settings, then defines subclasses for Selenium-specific configurations. No input or output operations, network activity, or data processing occurs within this snippet. The code appears to be part of a larger framework for web testing or automation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, standard code for setting up configuration classes within a web testing framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
