{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for Selenium check settings by extending existing WebCheckSettings classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, attr library, and applitools.common.fluent.web_check_settings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or execution flows.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks; classes mainly define data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; straightforward class inheritance with no dynamic execution or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features, utilizes attr for class definitions, and extends classes from an external library. There are no inputs, data processing, or outputs; it primarily sets up data structure classes. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears standard for defining configuration classes, with no embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for configuration objects related to Selenium check settings, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
