  "purpose": "Define Selenium-specific check settings classes by extending existing web check settings classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard and third-party libraries, module imports, class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; code only defines classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines two classes that extend existing classes for web check settings, specifically for Selenium integration. The classes do not contain methods, data processing, or untrusted input handling. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard class extension with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of existing settings classes for Selenium, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
