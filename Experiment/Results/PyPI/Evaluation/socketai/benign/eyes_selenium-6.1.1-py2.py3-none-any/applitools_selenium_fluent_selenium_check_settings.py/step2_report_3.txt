  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of class definitions extending existing classes from the `applitools.common.fluent.web_check_settings` module.\n   - It imports the `attr` library and uses it to define data classes.\n   - No functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - The classes serve as configuration holders, likely for Selenium web checks.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - The code does not contain any network calls, file operations, or code execution commands.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code appears to be part of a larger testing or automation framework, purely defining data structures.\n\n3. **Evaluation of the Report's Findings:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with a confidence level of 1.\n   - They identify no anomalies, no untrusted data handling, and no malicious intent.\n   - The code is standard class extension code with no signs of malware or security issues.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, correctly indicating the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0, as there are no security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly do not assume any malicious intent; they base their conclusion on the code's simplicity.\n   - No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is standard, benign class extension code for configuration purposes.\n   - No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No further action or escalation is necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, and the reports are accurate.",
