{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for marshaling WebDriver and WebElement objects for use in a larger framework, likely for remote communication or serialization.",
  "sources": "Reads attributes from WebDriver objects (command_executor, session_id, capabilities) and WebElement objects (element ID).",
  "sinks": "Returns dictionaries with session and element identifiers; no direct data sinks or external communication in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Extracts data from WebDriver/WebElement instances (sources) and constructs dictionaries (sinks) for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code uses standard attribute access and type hints. No obfuscated language features or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations and a registry class, then defines a subclass that marshals WebDriver and WebElement objects into dictionaries. It performs attribute access on objects that are expected to be from Selenium. The attribute access appears standard and intended for serialization. There are no external network operations, no data leaks, or suspicious data handling. The code relies on attributes that are typical in Selenium WebDriver and WebElement objects. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward serialization utility for Selenium WebDriver objects, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It reads data and prepares it for external use in a manner consistent with its purpose.",
