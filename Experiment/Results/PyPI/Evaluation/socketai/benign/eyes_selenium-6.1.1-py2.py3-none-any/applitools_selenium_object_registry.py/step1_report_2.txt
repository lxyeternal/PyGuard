{
  "purpose": "To serialize Selenium WebDriver and WebElement objects into dictionaries for further processing or transmission.",
  "sources": "The code reads attributes from WebDriver (command_executor, session_id, capabilities) and WebElement (._id).",
  "sinks": "The marshaling functions produce dictionaries that could potentially be used to identify or track browser sessions and elements.",
  "flows": "Input data from WebDriver/WebElement objects are processed and converted into dictionaries; no data flows to external systems or network communications within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The use of internal attributes such as '_url', '_client_config', and '_id' suggests reliance on private or non-public attributes, which may change or be misused. However, this is typical for internal object serialization and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing and a common object registry class. It defines a class for marshaling Selenium WebDriver and WebElement objects into dictionaries. The methods access attributes that are typically internal or private, which could be risky if the underlying objects change, but this does not imply malicious intent. The function focuses on data extraction for serialization. There are no network communications, obfuscated code, or malicious actions present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for serializing WebDriver and WebElement objects, relying on internal attributes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, nor does it contain malicious payloads. The use of internal attributes warrants caution but is common in such serialization contexts.",
