{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for marshaling Selenium WebDriver and WebElement objects into dictionaries for serialization or transmission.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from WebDriver and WebElement objects, specifically from properties such as command_executor, _url, _client_config, session_id, and _id.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include returning dictionaries with session ID, server URL, capabilities, and element ID, which could expose internal WebDriver state or identifiers if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from WebDriver and WebElement properties (sources) into dictionaries returned by marshal_driver and marshal_element methods (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "The code accesses private attributes (_url, _client_config, _id), which may be considered unconventional or risky if these attributes are manipulated or manipulated externally. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and a specific ObjectRegistry class, then defines a subclass for marshaling WebDriver and WebElement objects. The marshal_driver method retrieves the command executor URL, either directly or via client configuration, and returns key session and capability info. The marshal_element method returns a simple element ID. All data access involves properties that are generally safe, but private attributes (_url, _client_config, _id) could be sensitive if exploited. No network connections, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks beyond potential exposure of internal identifiers if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for serializing WebDriver objects for purposes such as remote execution or logging. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or malware. The only minor concern is the use of private attributes, which is typical in internal code but should be handled carefully to prevent leaks. Overall, it is a safe and typical utility code with low security risk.",
