  "purpose": "Serialize Selenium WebDriver and WebElement objects into dictionaries for external use or logging.",
  "sources": "Accesses WebDriver attributes like command_executor, session_id, capabilities, and WebElement's _id.",
  "sinks": "None present; code only reads attributes, no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads internal attributes (_url, _client_config, _id) and constructs dictionaries from them.",
  "anomalies": "Accesses private/internal attributes (_url, _client_config, _id), which could be fragile if underlying implementations change.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward serialization of Selenium objects by extracting key attributes. It relies on internal/private attributes, which is common but can be unstable if the underlying library updates. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of internal attributes poses minimal security risk but warrants caution in sensitive environments. The code does not process untrusted input or execute external commands.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard serialization utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The reliance on internal attributes is typical for such utilities but should be monitored for future changes. Overall, the code is safe, with a very low security risk, and no signs of malware.",
