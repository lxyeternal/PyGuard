  "purpose": "The code is designed to serialize Selenium WebDriver and WebElement objects into dictionaries for further processing or transmission.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from WebDriver objects (command_executor, session_id, capabilities) and WebElement objects (element ID).",
  "sinks": "The code outputs dictionaries containing session IDs, URLs, capabilities, and element IDs; no untrusted data is directly written or sent anywhere.",
  "flows": "Input WebDriver/WebElement objects -> extract attributes -> create dictionaries for serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns. The code handles potential missing attributes with exceptions, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type checking features and a registry class, defines a subclass for marshalling Selenium objects, and extracts key attributes safely. It retrieves server URL from the command executor, handling cases where the URL may not be directly available, and raises exceptions if necessary. The methods only serialize object attributes into dictionaries without executing external commands, network calls, or handling untrusted input beyond standard object attribute access. There are no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for serializing Selenium WebDriver and WebElement objects, with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs attribute extraction for serialization purposes only.",
