{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes from the 'applitools.common.fluent.region' package and define an export list for the module.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from a third-party library; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network or file operations, no data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module importing classes and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic execution, no data handling, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with full confidence. The code's simplicity and standard structure support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
