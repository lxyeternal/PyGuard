{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes from the 'applitools.common.fluent.region' module and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a third-party library (applitools). No data input reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely import/export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module import and export statement. It imports three classes from a third-party package and makes them available for external use. There are no code execution, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. The presence of a third-party library does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious logic, nor does it perform any network or system operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import/export declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It poses no security risk.",
