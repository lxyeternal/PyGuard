  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from a module within the applitools.common.fluent.region package and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the module 'applitools.common.fluent.region' which reads external class definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network, file, or environment variable writes; the code only imports classes and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes from an external module and defining an __all__ list for export. There are no input sources that could be malicious, nor are there any sinks or data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities. The code appears to be standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import and export declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
