{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from a module within the 'applitools.common.fluent.region' package, likely to be used for defining visual regions in testing or automation tasks.",
  "sources": "The code sources data by importing classes from an external module, which may load classes dynamically or contain internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or evaluation of untrusted input present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident; the code only performs static imports and defines an __all__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with future import statements for compatibility, then imports specific classes from a package related to regions, and defines an __all__ variable to specify exports. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network calls, or handling of sensitive data. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, standard module import and export declaration with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
