  "purpose": "Extend the current package's __path__ for package data discovery across multiple directories or zip files.",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies __path__, which is used internally by Python package mechanisms; no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a common pattern in namespace packages and does not perform any unusual or suspicious actions. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the __path__ variable, which is a standard method for handling namespace packages to include multiple locations. This pattern is well-known and used for package modularity. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard Python mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation for namespace packages and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a safe pattern used for package management.",
