  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ to support namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' on '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is written or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "The code modifies the '__path__' variable, which affects module import paths but does not involve untrusted data or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious constructs; this is a standard namespace package pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and applies 'extend_path' to '__path__' using '__name__'. This is a common pattern in Python to support namespace packages, allowing multiple packages to contribute to the same namespace. No external data is read, no untrusted inputs are processed, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is minimal and standard for a namespace package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
