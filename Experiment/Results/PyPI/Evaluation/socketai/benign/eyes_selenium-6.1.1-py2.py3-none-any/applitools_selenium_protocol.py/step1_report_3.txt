{
  "purpose": "This code defines a SeleniumWebDriver class that inherits from USDKProtocol, setting up object registry and SDK info for the Eyes Selenium SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements for future features, USDKProtocol from applitools.common.protocol, and local version and object registry modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or data processing that handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The class setup involves static assignments without data flow from external inputs; no dynamic execution or data transformation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features, a protocol class, version info, and an object registry. It then defines a class inheriting from USDKProtocol, with class variables for object registry and SDK info. No user input handling, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behaviors are evident. The structure is standard for a SDK module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for a Python SDK component, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators.",
