  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The provided code is a straightforward class definition:\n     ```python\n     from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function\n\n     from applitools.common.protocol import USDKProtocol\n\n     from .__version__ import __version__\n     from .object_registry import SeleniumWebdriverObjectRegistry\n\n\n     class SeleniumWebDriver(USDKProtocol):\n         _ObjectRegistry = SeleniumWebdriverObjectRegistry\n         SDK_INFO = \"eyes-selenium\", __version__\n     ```\n   - It imports standard future features, a protocol class, version info, and an object registry.\n   - It defines a class inheriting from `USDKProtocol`, setting static attributes for object registry and SDK info.\n   - There are no dynamic operations, no untrusted data handling, no network calls, and no sensitive operations.\n\n2. **Issues Present in the Code:**\n   - The code appears to be a typical SDK class setup with no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or data leaks.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports describe the code as standard, benign, and typical for an SDK wrapper.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static, with no data flows from untrusted sources, no external connections, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and no anomalies or anomalies are noted.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Generally very low (0 or 0.1). Given the code's simplicity and lack of external or dynamic behavior, these seem appropriate.\n   - The only slight deviation is in report 3, which assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1 and confidence 0.9. This minor concern could be due to conservative assessment but remains reasonable given the static nature.\n\n5. **Potential Misinterpretations or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume no malicious intent based on static analysis, which is appropriate here.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or exploits are made, which is correct.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard class definition for an SDK component.\n   - No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 or 0.1, depending on whether a very conservative approach is preferred.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, as no security issues are detected.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, primarily due to the nature of static code analysis and standard SDK setup)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's straightforward structure.",
