  "purpose": "Define a Selenium WebDriver class inheriting from USDKProtocol with static attributes for object registry and SDK info.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, class inheritance, class attribute assignments",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definition without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class setup with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static class definition importing standard modules and setting class attributes. No dynamic behaviors, external inputs, or network activity are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of zero for malware and obfuscation, and very low security risk. The code's static, straightforward nature aligns with the assessments, and no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK class definition with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, harmless nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
