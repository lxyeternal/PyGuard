  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering potential security implications.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe provided code is a straightforward class definition:\n```python\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function\n\nfrom applitools.common.protocol import USDKProtocol\n\nfrom .__version__ import __version__\nfrom .object_registry import SeleniumWebdriverObjectRegistry\n\n\nclass SeleniumWebDriver(USDKProtocol):\n    _ObjectRegistry = SeleniumWebdriverObjectRegistry\n    SDK_INFO = \"eyes-selenium\", __version__\n```\nIt imports some future features, a protocol class, version info, and an object registry. Then, it defines a class inheriting from `USDKProtocol`, setting static class attributes for object registry and SDK info.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Concerns:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is standard, static, and does not execute any dynamic or external code.\n\n- **Malicious or suspicious patterns?**  \n  No. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, network activity, or dynamic execution.\n\n- **Data flow or external input?**  \n  None. The code only defines a class with static attributes.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  Not evident. The code appears to be a typical SDK setup class.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Reports 1, 2, 4, 5:\n- **Assessment:** All these reports conclude that the code is standard, benign, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Analysis consistency:** They are consistent with the code, noting the static nature, lack of external interactions, and standard import patterns.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly high (1.0), which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Scores:** All report malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still finds no suspicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1, which is marginally above zero, perhaps reflecting a cautious approach. Given the code's static and benign nature, this is likely an overestimation.\n- **Malware score:** 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as expected.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- All reports assign very low or zero security risk and malware scores, which is justified given the code's static, straightforward nature.\n- The only slightly elevated score (0.1) in report 3 might be an overly cautious default or a minor conservative adjustment.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code correctness:** No issues found.\n- **Malware risk:** 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Essentially zero; the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security concerns)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent with the code, which is a standard SDK class definition. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated elements are present. The scores assigned are appropriate, perhaps slightly conservative in some cases.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code is benign, with no security risks or malware. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a risk score of zero as well.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future dynamic code or runtime behaviors, but based on this static analysis, the code is safe.",
