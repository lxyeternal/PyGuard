  "purpose": "Define a SeleniumWebDriver class inheriting from USDKProtocol, with associated registry and version info.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, applitools.common.protocol, local version, and object registry modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no use of untrusted data, network calls, or sensitive operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily defines a class with static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious patterns observed. The code appears to be standard class definition and import usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features, a protocol class, version info, and a registry, then defines a subclass with static attributes. No user input, network activity, or dynamic execution present. The imports are from well-known libraries and local modules; nothing suspicious in the structure or content.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical class definition for a Selenium WebDriver wrapper with associated version and registry info. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
