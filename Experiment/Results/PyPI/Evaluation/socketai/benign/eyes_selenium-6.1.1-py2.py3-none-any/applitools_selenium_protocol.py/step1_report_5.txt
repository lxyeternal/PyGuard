{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a Selenium WebDriver class that extends a protocol class from the applitools library, setting up object registry and SDK information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, applitools.common.protocol, and local modules __version__ and object_registry.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data processing, output, or network operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Imports lead into class definition; no runtime data flow, input handling, or untrusted data propagation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage of version and registry info appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, loads a protocol class, and defines a subclass with class variables for object registry and SDK info. No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations are present. The structure is typical for a SDK component, with no signs of malicious intent or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a Selenium WebDriver wrapper within an SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
