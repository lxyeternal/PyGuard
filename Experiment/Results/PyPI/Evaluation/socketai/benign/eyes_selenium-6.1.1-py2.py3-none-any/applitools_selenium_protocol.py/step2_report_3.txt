  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports future features, a protocol class, version info, and an object registry.\n- It defines a class `SeleniumWebDriver` inheriting from `USDKProtocol`.\n- The class sets static attributes `_ObjectRegistry` and `SDK_INFO`.\n- No dynamic code, user input handling, network operations, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All conclude that the code is standard, straightforward, and benign.\n- No untrusted data handling, external connections, or malicious patterns are observed.\n- The import statements and class definitions are typical for SDK setup.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware indicators are identified.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and no security risks are noted.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- No report mentions any code that could be malicious or obfuscated.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscated are all zero.\n- The security risk scores are minimal or zero.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior?**  \n  The code is a simple class definition with static attributes. No network, file, or data processing is involved. No user input or dynamic code execution is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  The code is clear, with no obfuscation techniques like encoding, convoluted logic, or hidden code.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities?**  \n  The code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities; it’s a standard SDK class setup.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:**  \n  The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- The code shows no signs of malicious activity. **Score: 0**\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- The code is clear and straightforward. **Score: 0**\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- Given the above, the overall security risk is negligible. **Score: 0**\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard SDK class definition with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways remain vigilant for future code that might introduce dynamic behaviors or external interactions, but in this case, the code is purely structural and safe.",
