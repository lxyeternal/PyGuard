{
  "purpose": "Define a Selenium WebDriver class that inherits from USDKProtocol and sets up object registry and SDK info.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, applitools.common.protocol, __version__, and object_registry modules.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling, external connections, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and internal.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard for defining a class with static attributes; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard future features, a protocol class, version info, and an object registry. It then defines a class inheriting from USDKProtocol, setting a registry class and SDK info as static attributes. No dynamic code execution, external connections, or data leaks are evident. The structure and imports are typical for a SDK wrapper or interface class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, standard for SDK class definitions, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
