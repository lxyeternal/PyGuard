  "purpose": "Define a Selenium WebDriver class inheriting from a protocol, with versioning and object registry setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements: __future__ imports, USDKProtocol from applitools.common.protocol, __version__ from local module, SeleniumWebdriverObjectRegistry from local module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data processing; class attributes and imports are static, and no runtime data handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the class definition is static and not influenced by external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward, standard Python class definition with imports and class variables.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features, a protocol class, version info, and a registry, then defines a class inheriting from the protocol, assigning a registry class and version info. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign class definition setting up a Selenium WebDriver with associated version and registry info. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified.",
