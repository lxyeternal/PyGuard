{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, reading version info and description from static files, and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'spotinst_sdk2/version.py' and long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads with no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static data from files assigned to variables, used in setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: reading version info via straightforward string parsing, loading long description, and calling setuptools.setup() with static metadata. No code injection, network activity, or obfuscation present. The use of sys.argv to conditionally include pytest-runner is standard. The dependencies are static and well-defined. Overall, the script is static, transparent, and aligns with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent risk in reading static files), which is acceptable. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
