  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a standard Python setup script.\n- They note that the script reads version info from a file, long description from README.md, and sets package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is observed.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n1. **Code Content:**\n   - The code performs typical setup tasks: reading version info, long description, and calling `setuptools.setup()`.\n   - No dynamic code execution (`eval`, `exec`), obfuscation, or external network activity.\n   - The version is extracted via straightforward string parsing from a file.\n   - Dependencies are static and standard (`requests`, `PyYaml`).\n\n2. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - The only minor point is the use of `sys.argv` to determine whether to include `pytest-runner`. This is standard practice and not suspicious.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n   - No code that could be malicious or obfuscated.\n\n3. **Malware and Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The code is transparent and straightforward.\n\n4. **Security Risks:**\n   - The overall risk is minimal; no untrusted data handling, no external code execution, and no network activity.\n   - The only slight elevation is a `securityRisk` score of 0.1 in some reports, likely due to the general nature of setup scripts, but nothing specific here.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0 or very close to it is appropriate. The reports' 0.1 scores are acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for precision.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The minor `securityRisk` score of 0.1 could be adjusted to 0 for accuracy, but this is a minor point.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                                  |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious code or activity present.                         |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code.                                    |\n| Security Risk  | 0                 | No vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior detected.            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the `version.py` and `README.md` files are themselves free of malicious code, but based on the provided script, there is no indication of issues.",
