{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Python package 'spotinst-sdk2', including reading version info, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'spotinst_sdk2/version.py', reading long description from 'README.md', importing setup and sys modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data flows to security-sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "flows": "No malicious or suspicious data flows from sources to sinks. The data read from files is used for configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs standard setup tasks; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads static files (README.md and version.py) to gather metadata. It then calls setuptools.setup() with package info, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data manipulation occurs. All imported modules are standard or well-known, and no untrusted input is processed. The version extraction method is straightforward, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks safely.",
