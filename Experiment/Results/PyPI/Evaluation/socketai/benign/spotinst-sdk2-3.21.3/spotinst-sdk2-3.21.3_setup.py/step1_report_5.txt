{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup process for the 'spotinst-sdk2' Python package, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package structure.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'version.py' for version info, sys.argv for command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used to affect system behavior or leak data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script primarily reads static files and sets package metadata without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution found. The version is extracted via simple string parsing; no eval or exec used.",
  "analysis": "The code reads static files for package metadata and versioning. It processes command-line arguments to determine test dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or network interactions are present. All dependencies and package data are hardcoded or read from known files, with no dynamic or malicious code execution. The code is straightforward and follows standard packaging practices. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads static files and configures package metadata securely. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
