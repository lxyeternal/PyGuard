  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the script is benign, standard, with no malicious activity. It notes no suspicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** The code is a typical setup script. No signs of malicious behavior are present. The report's conclusion is consistent with the code content.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the script only reads static files and sets up package metadata without any dynamic or malicious operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** The securityRisk is marginally above zero, possibly reflecting a very slight concern about reading files or the general nature of setup scripts. However, nothing malicious is detected. The score seems slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the script reads version info and description from static files, with no suspicious operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning as above; the minimal securityRisk score reflects the standard nature of setup scripts.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the script is a typical setup routine with no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the other reports, the script is benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, emphasizing that the script reads static files and configures package metadata without executing untrusted code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None detected. All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script.\n- **Malware risk:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code content.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), likely due to the general nature of setup scripts that read files and parse version info, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.\n- **Confidence:** Full (1), as all reports concur.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code detected.\n- The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is reasonable, reflecting the inherent trust in setup scripts that read static files.\n\n### My recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0** (no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent)\n- **Confidence:** **1** (full confidence in benign nature)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security risks. The reports are consistent and accurate.",
