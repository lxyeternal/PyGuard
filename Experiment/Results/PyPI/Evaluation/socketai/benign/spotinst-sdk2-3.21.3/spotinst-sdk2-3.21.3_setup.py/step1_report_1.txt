{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python SDK package, primarily to specify package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'spotinst_sdk2/version.py', reading long description from 'README.md', and parsing command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; package installation, metadata declaration, and dependencies are standard operations.",
  "flows": "Reading version info and description data from files, then passing metadata into setup() for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads version and description data from files, and defines package configuration and dependencies. All operations are standard for a Python setup script. No signs of malicious activity such as network connections, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code obfuscation are detected. The code structure and content align with typical package setup routines, with no anomalies or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
