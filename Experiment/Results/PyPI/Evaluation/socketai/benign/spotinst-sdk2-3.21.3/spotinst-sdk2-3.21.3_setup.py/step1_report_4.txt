  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python SDK package including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; reading version from version.py file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file, or environment variable leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading version data from version.py to populate setup; reading README.md for description; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for setup and package configuration. It reads the project version from a separate version.py file, and the README.md for description. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. The dependencies are standard, and there are no hidden network calls, credential handling, or malicious payloads. All code is typical for Python package setup. No anomalies or potential malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a SDK. It reads version info and description from files, sets up package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
