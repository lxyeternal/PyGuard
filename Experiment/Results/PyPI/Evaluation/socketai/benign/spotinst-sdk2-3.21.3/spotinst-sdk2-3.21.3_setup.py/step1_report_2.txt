{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; reading version.py for version information; static data in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external data handling or code execution with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily reads files for package metadata without processing untrusted input or executing dynamic code flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. No network connections, no credential handling, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata from static files, including version and README content, then calls setuptools.setup() with fixed arguments. It conditionally includes pytest-related dependencies based on command-line arguments. There are no code injections, external data processing, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The script's purpose is to facilitate package installation and metadata management.",
