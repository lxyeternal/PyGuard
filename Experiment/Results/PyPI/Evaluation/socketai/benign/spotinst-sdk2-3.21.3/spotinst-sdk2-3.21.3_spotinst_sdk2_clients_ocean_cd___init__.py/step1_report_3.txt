{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client interface for managing Ocean Continuous Delivery (CD) resources via API calls, including clusters, verification providers, templates, strategies, rollout specs, rollouts, and workloads.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input parameters such as IDs, names, JSON responses from API calls, and request objects converted to JSON.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are API request bodies (JSON payloads) sent via send_post, send_put, and send_delete methods; URLs constructed with input parameters; and the responses processed and returned.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through request object serialization, JSON transformation, and API calls to responses which are formatted and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of JSON serialization/deserialization is standard. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. All URL constructions use parameters or constants, with no user-controlled URL components. No suspicious domain or network activity evident in this code fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a structured API client, converting objects to JSON, excluding missing fields, and formatting responses. It uses conventional API interaction patterns. No evidence of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The code does not handle sensitive secrets directly; any credentials or secrets would likely be managed outside this code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious injections, or unusual data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate API client for managing Ocean CD resources. It employs standard practices for API interaction, data serialization, and response handling. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or supply chain attacks within this fragment.",
