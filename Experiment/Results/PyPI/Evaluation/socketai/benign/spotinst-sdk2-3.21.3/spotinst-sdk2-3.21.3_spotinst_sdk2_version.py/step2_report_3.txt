  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static version string to `__version__`. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. This is standard practice in Python packages and contains no malicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports give 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any activity that warrants a higher risk score. The code is static, simple, and standard. Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   Since no malicious activity is detected, the malware score should be 0. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that the code is standard and benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe original code is a minimal, standard version declaration in Python, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign.\n\n**Note:** No changes to the scores are necessary. The assessments are aligned with the code's simplicity and safety.",
