  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a package metadata declaration.",
  "sources": "None; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. No inputs, data flows, external calls, or dynamic behaviors are present. The code is minimal, clear, and standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the code's simplicity and safety. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
