  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, data flows, external calls, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent is evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that this is standard version declaration code with no security concerns.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is just a static string assignment, raising the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores would be unjustified.\n   - The reports are appropriately conservative.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious code are made; all assessments are accurate.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate for version declaration.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - No inconsistencies or unreasonable scores are evident.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:** Given the analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is benign, straightforward, and standard practice.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is a typical version declaration snippet with no security concerns. The scores and reasoning are appropriate and consistent across all reports.",
