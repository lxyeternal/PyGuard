{
  "purpose": "This code manages user sessions by loading credentials from environment variables, YAML, or INI configuration files for interacting with the Spotinst API.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (VAR_SPOTINST_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE, VAR_SPOTINST_PROFILE, VAR_SPOTINST_TOKEN, VAR_SPOTINST_ACCOUNT), and credentials files (YAML and INI formats).",
  "sinks": "Loading credentials into class attributes (auth_token, account_id) from files or environment variables; no direct data leakage or sensitive operation sink evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or files -> load_credentials() -> YAML/INI parsing -> setting class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Uses YAML.load() with SafeLoader which is generally safe; credentials are stored in plaintext files; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically loads credentials from environment variables or configuration files, employing standard libraries (yaml, configparser). It uses safe YAML loading (yaml.SafeLoader). The flow from sources (env vars/files) to sinks (class attributes) is straightforward and typical for credential management. No hardcoded secrets are present; credentials are stored externally. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified. The exception handling is minimal but appropriate, catching common parsing errors. No signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical credential loading module with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations to load credentials securely from environment variables and configuration files, without suspicious or malicious actions.",
