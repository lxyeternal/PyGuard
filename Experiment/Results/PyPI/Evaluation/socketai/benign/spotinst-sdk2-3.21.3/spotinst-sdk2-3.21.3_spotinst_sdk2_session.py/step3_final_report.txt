  "purpose": "Credential management for Spotinst API via environment variables, YAML, and INI files, ensuring secure loading and handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (VAR_SPOTINST_*), credentials YAML and INI configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to class attributes (self.auth_token, self.account_id); no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or files → load_credentials() → YAML/INI parsing → attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs safe libraries (yaml.SafeLoader, configparser), with exception handling. It loads credentials from environment variables or configuration files, which is standard practice. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The credential files are read securely, and no network activity or data exfiltration occurs. The credential handling approach is typical and secure, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, straightforward credential loader with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The existing malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
