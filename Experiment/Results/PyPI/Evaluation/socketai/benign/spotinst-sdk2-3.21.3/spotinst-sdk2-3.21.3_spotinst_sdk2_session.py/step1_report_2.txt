  "purpose": "This code manages the loading of credentials for the Spotinst API, supporting environment variables, YAML, and INI configuration files.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (VAR_SPOTINST_ACCOUNT, VAR_SPOTINST_TOKEN), credentials files (YAML and INI formats).",
  "sinks": "Variables storing credentials (auth_token, account_id) used for API authentication.",
  "flows": "Credentials are first loaded from environment variables; if absent, loaded from credentials files (YAML or INI), which are read from disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets; credentials are loaded from user-specified or environment-specified locations. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads credentials primarily from environment variables or user-specified configuration files. It correctly handles YAML and INI formats with exception handling. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as network transmission of data, code injection, or backdoors. The credential handling appears standard for configuration loading, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. The usage of external libraries (yaml, configparser) is typical and benign in this context. No signs of obfuscation or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard credential loading for API access, with appropriate error handling and configuration management. There are no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The security posture appears appropriate for its purpose.",
