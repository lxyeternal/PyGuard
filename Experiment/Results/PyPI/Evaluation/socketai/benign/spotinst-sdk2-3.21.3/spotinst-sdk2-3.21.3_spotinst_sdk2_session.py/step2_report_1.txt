  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code loads credentials from environment variables or configuration files (YAML/INI).\n- Uses safe libraries (`yaml.SafeLoader`) and exception handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscation detected.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior evident.\n- The credential management approach is standard and secure.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Secure, standard credential loading; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard practices, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Slightly higher security risk score due to reliance on external files, but still reasonable.\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same credential loading approach; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Consistent with prior reports.\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same credential loading logic; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree that the code is straightforward and secure.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varying (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern due to external file handling, which is acceptable.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity or code behavior).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected).\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (standard credential handling with minimal external file reliance).\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (reflecting the minimal security concern around external file handling, which is typical in such scenarios).\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments needed. The code appears secure, well-implemented, and free of malicious intent.",
