  "purpose": "Manage and load credentials for Spotinst API access via environment variables, YAML, or INI configuration files.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (VAR_SPOTINST_ACCOUNT, VAR_SPOTINST_TOKEN), local credentials files (YAML and INI formats).",
  "sinks": "Credentials are stored in class attributes (self.auth_token, self.account_id) for API authentication.",
  "flows": "Code reads environment variables and credentials files; loads credentials into object attributes for API use.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; standard credential loading mechanisms are used. No hardcoded secrets present. No suspicious network or data exfiltration activities.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads credentials from environment variables or configuration files using safe libraries (yaml.SafeLoader, configparser). It employs standard practices for handling credentials, with exception handling to avoid crashes. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical credential management module for an SDK, with proper security considerations. It does not contain malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The only concern would be if credentials are stored insecurely, but this is a standard practice; no malware or malicious activity is evident.",
