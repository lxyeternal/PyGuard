  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and the code's structure.\n\n**Report 1**:\n- **Summary**: The code is a straightforward SDK wrapper that initializes a session and provides clients for various services. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable. The low security risk aligns with the lack of sensitive data handling beyond parameter passing.\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is sound; no issues found. The code is typical for SDK client management.\n\n**Report 2**:\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard pattern, no malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Assessment**: The analysis is consistent. No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3**:\n- **Summary**: Same as above—standard SDK client factory, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 fit well.\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is correct; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 4**:\n- **Summary**: Again, a standard session and client creation pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Assessment**: No anomalies or security concerns.\n\n**Report 5**:\n- **Summary**: Consistent with previous, standard SDK setup.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified.\n- **Assessment**: No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: Given that the code is purely for SDK client setup, with no data leaks, network activity, or secret hardcoding, a very low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate. Some reports assign 0.2, which is slightly conservative but acceptable. Since no vulnerabilities are identified, I would suggest a risk score of **0.1** for all.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code accepts sensitive parameters like `auth_token` and `credentials_file` but does not hardcode or leak them. Proper handling depends on external security practices.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.\n- The code's purpose is purely to facilitate SDK client creation, with no suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 for all reports — confirmed safe.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 for all reports — clear code.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 for all reports — minimal security risk, primarily due to handling of credentials externally.\n\n**Overall, the code appears secure, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.**",
