  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential security issues, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code creates a session and various SDK clients. No suspicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the absence of any vulnerabilities or suspicious activity.\n- Malware score is correctly zero.\n- Obfuscated is zero.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Reduce securityRisk to 0.1, aligning with the safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard SDK client factory pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent and reasonable.\n- No issues detected.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard SDK client management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Fully aligned with the code's nature.\n- No suspicious activity.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general assessment, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SDK session and client creation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly identified as safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code's nature, these are reasonable, but perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code is a utility wrapper with no vulnerabilities, I would set the overall risk score to **0.1** for all, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Justification for risk score of 0.1:\n- The code handles sensitive parameters like `auth_token` and `credentials_file`, but only as input parameters, with no hardcoded secrets.\n- No suspicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks.\n- Standard SDK pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          | Standard SDK wrapper, no malicious activity. Slightly conservative risk score. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          | Same reasoning. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          | Same reasoning. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          | Same reasoning. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          | Same reasoning. |\n\n**Final note:** No obfuscation or malware is present, and the low risk score accurately reflects the code's benign nature.",
