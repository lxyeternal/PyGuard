  "purpose": "This code provides a client library for managing Ocean clusters across AWS, Azure, and GCP, including cluster creation, updates, deletion, node group management, rollouts, migrations, cost analyses, and right-sizing recommendations. It facilitates interaction with various cloud providers' APIs for Kubernetes and ECS clusters.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as resource identifiers, configuration objects, and filter criteria. The code also reads JSON data conversions from object methods and API responses. There are no external untrusted input sources within this code fragment.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data via HTTP requests (POST, PUT, GET, DELETE) to various API endpoints. It constructs request bodies from data objects and parameters, converting them to JSON. The only potential sink is the network call via 'send_post', 'send_put', 'send_get', etc., which transmits data to external endpoints.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and configuration objects through JSON serialization, which is then sent as network requests. Response data is parsed from JSON back into objects. There are no indications of data flow from untrusted sources into sink functions within this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data are present. The code relies on method calls like 'json.dumps', 'json.loads', and object serialization, which are standard. No use of 'exec', 'eval', or dynamic code execution is observed. All network endpoints appear to be well-structured API calls; no obfuscation or code hiding techniques are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive client library for managing cloud resources via REST API calls, structured with class-based methods for each API endpoint. It serializes objects to JSON for requests and deserializes JSON responses. No suspicious code patterns, such as dynamic execution, backdoors, or malicious network communications, are identified. The network communication is standard for SDK-like libraries, with endpoint URLs constructed from class attributes and method parameters. All data handling appears to be within the scope of normal SDK behavior, with no evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK client implementation for managing cloud clusters across multiple providers. It performs network requests to known API endpoints with appropriate data serialization. No malicious behaviors, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The overall malware score is very low, and there are no indications of malicious intent. It is a legitimate, well-structured SDK module.",
