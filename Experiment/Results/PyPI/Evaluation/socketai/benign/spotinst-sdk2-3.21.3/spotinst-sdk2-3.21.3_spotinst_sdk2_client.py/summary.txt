  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK client for Spotinst with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The security risk is low, primarily related to logging practices, but no actual malicious activity is detected. The scores across reports are justified and should remain as is."
