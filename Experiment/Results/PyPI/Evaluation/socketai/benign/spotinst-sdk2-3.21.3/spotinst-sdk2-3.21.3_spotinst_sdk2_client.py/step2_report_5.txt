  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, while verifying the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client with URL validation, logging, JSON handling, and request methods. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (low). The confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; the code is typical SDK code with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk is appropriate given the use of environment variables and standard practices.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a typical API client with no malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the analysis; no malicious activity or obfuscation is found.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API client with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. It mentions that logs could contain sensitive info but that’s typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature; no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical SDK client, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It notes that logging could expose sensitive data but does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** The analysis is consistent; no malware or obfuscation is detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. It notes potential privacy concerns with logging but no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no malware or obfuscation is evident.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code is a typical SDK client with no malicious routines.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is consistent given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation patterns.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.2 is low, reflecting typical API client considerations, mainly around logging sensitive data and URL validation.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified across all reports.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The analysis confirms that the code is a legitimate, standard API client with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports are accurate and the scoring is appropriate. The code is safe and does not exhibit any malicious or obfuscated behaviors.",
