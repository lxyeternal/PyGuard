  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client for Spotinst, with URL validation, request methods, JSON handling, and logging. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are identified.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, typical for SDKs handling tokens)\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's characteristics. The URL validation appears to prevent unsafe URL concatenation. Logging does not explicitly log sensitive data. The code handles authorization tokens properly and uses standard libraries.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The malware and obfuscation scores are reasonable. The security risk is low, given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SDK patterns, URL validation, and JSON processing. No suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The code handles sensitive data responsibly, with standard practices.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical API client with proper request handling, logging, and URL validation. No malicious activity or backdoors observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The code's structure and behavior are standard. The only minor note is that response content is logged, which could expose sensitive info, but this is common in debugging logs and not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified. No malware or obfuscation concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing request handling, URL validation, and JSON processing. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The code is straightforward. No evidence of malware or obfuscation. Logging of response content is a potential privacy concern but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SDK client with request methods, URL validation, and JSON utilities. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The code does not exhibit malicious patterns. It uses environment variables for log levels, handles tokens properly, and performs URL validation.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior are evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting typical SDK considerations, not actual security threats.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (low, standard for SDKs handling tokens and logging)\n\n**In summary,** the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
