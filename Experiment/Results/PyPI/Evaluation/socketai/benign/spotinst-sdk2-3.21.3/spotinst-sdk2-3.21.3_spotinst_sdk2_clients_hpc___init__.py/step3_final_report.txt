{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client SDK for managing HPC clusters via REST API calls, handling JSON serialization/deserialization, and performing network requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method parameters, constructs URLs, and serializes data to JSON before sending network requests.",
  "sinks": "The network request functions (`send_post`, `send_get`, `send_delete`, `send_put`) send data over the network; JSON serialization could potentially leak data if misused, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs through JSON serialization, URL construction, and into network request functions; responses are deserialized back into Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard practices without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK client managing HPC clusters, performing JSON serialization and REST API calls. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. External network functions are presumed secure. The code does not handle untrusted input directly in a manner that would introduce vulnerabilities. The overall structure and behavior are typical for such SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard API client with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to network interactions.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
