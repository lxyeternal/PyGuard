  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing and possibly interacts with external resources, but the exact purpose is not explicitly clear from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Reads data from user input, environment variables, or external files; potentially fetches data from network sources or APIs.",
  "sinks": "Writes to files, outputs to console, or sends data over network connections; may execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks such as network sockets or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or obfuscated code. No unusual code constructs or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for typical malicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, unsafe code execution, or data exfiltration. It uses standard libraries and practices with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are apparent. The flow of data appears typical for a data processing script. Without additional context or external dependencies, no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It is a standard implementation without suspicious anomalies or malicious intent.",
