  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client for managing Azure Stateful Nodes, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious URLs. The 'none' variable is unused and benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious signals are present. The 'none' variable is suspicious but unused, which does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client behavior with no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The 'none' variable is suspicious but unused.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the first report; no malicious signals.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical API client with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The 'none' variable is present but unused.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; safe and legitimate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard API client code.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; 'none' variable appears benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns; consistent with prior assessments.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a straightforward SDK-based API client.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation. 'none' variable is unused.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious signals detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a standard API client, serializing input data, making API calls, and processing responses.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are zero; no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Secrets & Credentials:** No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- **Suspicious 'none' variable:** The variable is a string with a seemingly random value but is unused throughout the code. It appears to be a placeholder or artifact, not malicious.\n- **Potential Risks:** The overall security risk is low, with scores around 0.1-0.2, reflecting typical minimal concern for such code.\n\n### Recommendations & Final Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0, but given the absence of any malicious or insecure patterns, a score of **0.1-0.2** is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** High, at **0.9**, as all reports concur.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justified Estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**       | **0.1** |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for managing Azure Stateful Nodes, with no evidence of supply chain malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The 'none' variable is an artifact and does not impact security. The overall assessment indicates very low risk.",
