  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for managing Azure Stateful Nodes with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The only minor concern is the unused 'none' variable, which does not impact security or functionality. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal."
