  "purpose": "Client class for managing Azure Stateful Nodes via API calls, performing create, update, delete, retrieve, and other operations using JSON serialization and SDK methods.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, JSON serialization of request objects, API response data",
  "sinks": "API request bodies, response parsing, response data returned to caller",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> JSON serialization -> send API request -> receive response -> parse JSON -> return data",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'none' variable with a string value 'd3043820717d74d9a17694c176d39733' that is unused throughout the code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK-based API client for Azure Stateful Nodes, with typical request/response handling. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation detected. The 'none' variable appears suspicious due to its name and value but is unused, indicating it is likely an artifact or placeholder. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code's logic is straightforward and aligns with expected API client patterns. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for managing Azure Stateful Nodes with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The only minor concern is the unused 'none' variable, which does not impact security or functionality. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
