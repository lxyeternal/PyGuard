{
  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a license header and version indicator for an open-source project, providing licensing information and a version string.",
  "sources": "The only source is the comment block containing licensing details and the assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is static and only contains comments and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with licensing comments and a version variable, typical for open-source headers.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a comment block with licensing information and a version string assignment. There are no functions, data processing, or executable logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the code is standard for open-source projects. The assessments across all reports are accurate and do not require adjustments.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign, standard license header with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there are no concerns based on this fragment.",
