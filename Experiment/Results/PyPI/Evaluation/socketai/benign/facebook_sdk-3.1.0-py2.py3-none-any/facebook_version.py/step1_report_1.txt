  "purpose": "This code appears to be a header or license comment for a Python script, likely part of a larger project, indicating licensing, copyright, and version information.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this snippet; it only contains comments and a version assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present; no potential for data leaks or security effects from this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is solely licensing comments and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing comments and a single version assignment variable. There are no executable functions, data input/output, or code logic. It does not exhibit obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The presence of only comments and a version variable suggests it is part of a larger codebase, but on its own, it shows no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely informational, serving as a license header and version indicator. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present in this snippet.",
