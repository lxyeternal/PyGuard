  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided summaries.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the library as a Facebook Graph API client, correctly noting the use of external modules, cookies, and network requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes network requests transmitting tokens and user data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. Highlights proper HMAC verification of signed requests.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states this is a legitimate client library with high confidence (0.9). No malware or obfuscation scores, and low security risk (0.2).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API interactions, correct handling of OAuth flows, and signature verification.\n- No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- Confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the standard, legitimate nature of the code, with proper token management, signature verification, and error handling.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- Confidence is even higher (1.0), malware score 0, obfuscation 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar findings: standard API client, proper signature verification, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- No malicious indicators, high confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscation 0, low security risk (0.2).\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments, describing legitimate API client behavior, correct handling of tokens, signed request verification, and no suspicious code.\n- High confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscation 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Summary:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** No. The code is a standard, well-structured Facebook API client library.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report logic:** The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws detected.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n  - **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n  - **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1-0.2), appropriate given the code's purpose and security measures.\n- **Justification for higher scores:** None of the reports justify higher scores. The code performs cryptographic verification, uses HTTPS, and does not contain secrets or backdoors.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and unobfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal risk, standard API client.\n\n**Overall, the code appears legitimate, secure, and free of malicious intent.**",
