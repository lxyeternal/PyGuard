  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard Facebook Graph API client, importing common libraries, handling OAuth, and making network requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests transmit access tokens, user data, media files; data flows from cookies, user input, and API responses.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. Uses standard cryptographic verification (HMAC) for signed requests.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard implementation with proper security measures; no malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2 (low), confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on data reading from cookies, API responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API requests, token handling, OAuth flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, standard practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate Facebook API client, secure handling, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard API interactions, OAuth, object retrieval.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API requests, token exchanges, responses.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no secrets, proper HMAC verification.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, standard API client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API requests, token management, OAuth flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no secrets, proper signature verification.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard Facebook API client, handles tokens, signed requests, uploads.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API calls, token handling, media uploads.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, proper HMAC verification.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate zero, which aligns with the code's purpose.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, consistent with standard API client code.\n- **Confidence:** High (mostly 0.9 or 1.0), indicating strong belief in the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, standard Facebook Graph API client library.\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities beyond the expected scope of such a library.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to standard API interactions, not due to any malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented Facebook API client library with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, and a very low security risk.",
