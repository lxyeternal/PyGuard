{
  "purpose": "A Python client library for interacting with the Facebook Graph API, supporting OAuth authentication, object retrieval, and content posting.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user cookies ('fbsr_' cookie), OAuth codes, and API responses; data is read from cookies, API responses, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to Facebook's API endpoints via HTTP requests; potential data leaks could occur if sensitive data is mishandled in logs or responses. Notably, the code sends access tokens and other data via network requests.",
  "flows": "Input from cookies or API responses flows into authentication and API request functions. OAuth tokens are exchanged or extended, and responses are processed to extract tokens or error information.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or suspicious logic was detected. Use of base64 decoding and HMAC verification appears standard. The function 'parse_signed_request' verifies signatures correctly. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code performs standard API interaction tasks without hidden backdoors or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical Facebook Graph API client with functions for OAuth flow, object retrieval, posting, and token management. It correctly manages sensitive tokens, performs signature verification for security, and handles HTTP requests with error checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of standard libraries and straightforward API calls suggests benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a legitimate and well-structured client library for Facebook's API. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The code handles tokens and API interactions securely and transparently. No suspicious anomalies or malicious intent are evident.",
