{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python client library for interacting with the Facebook Graph API, enabling operations such as fetching user data, posting content, managing permissions, and handling OAuth authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from API responses, OAuth authorization flows, cookies (fbsr_*), and function parameters for API requests and authentication.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over HTTP requests to Facebook API endpoints, reads cookies, and processes user inputs for OAuth flows and API calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources like cookies and user parameters into functions that construct API requests, which are then sent over HTTP to Facebook's servers. Responses are parsed and returned to callers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code employs standard Facebook API client patterns, uses safe decoding methods, and handles exceptions appropriately. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Facebook Graph API client with functions for retrieving objects, permissions, posting, deleting, and OAuth flows. It includes safe parsing of signed requests with HMAC validation. It uses established libraries and methods without suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors. Error handling is standard, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are observed. The code's structure and comments indicate legitimate functionality intended for API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Facebook Graph API client library. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage mechanisms. The overall security risk is very low, with no suspicious elements detected.",
