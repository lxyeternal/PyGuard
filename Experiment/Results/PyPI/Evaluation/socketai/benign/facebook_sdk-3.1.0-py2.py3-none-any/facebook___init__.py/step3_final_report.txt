{
  "purpose": "A Python client library for interacting with the Facebook Graph API, handling OAuth, object retrieval, posting, and signed request verification.",
  "sources": "Cookies for user authentication, network requests to Facebook API endpoints, input parameters for API calls.",
  "sinks": "Network responses containing user data, access tokens, media uploads, and API responses that may include errors or data leaks if mishandled.",
  "flows": "Input data from cookies or user parameters flows into API request functions; responses are processed and returned, with cryptographic verification of signed requests to ensure integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Facebook SDK functionalities with proper cryptographic verification (HMAC-SHA256), secure HTTPS communication, and error handling. It does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The cryptographic functions are correctly used to verify signed requests, and network requests include access tokens over HTTPS. No suspicious data leaks or backdoors are present. The scores assigned across reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2—are consistent with the code's legitimate and secure implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented Facebook Graph API client library. It employs proper cryptographic verification, secure network communication, and error handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise is evident. The low malware and obfuscation scores, along with minimal risk, are justified.",
