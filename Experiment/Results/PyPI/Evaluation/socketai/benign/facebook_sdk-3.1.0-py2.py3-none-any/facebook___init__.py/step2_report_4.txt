  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard Facebook Graph API client library.\n- It performs OAuth, object retrieval, posting, and signed request verification.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The code uses HTTPS, HMAC, and standard security practices.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), which seems reasonable given the functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in code:\n- The code appears legitimate and aligns with standard SDK practices.\n- No evidence of backdoors, secret exfiltration, or malicious behavior.\n- The HMAC verification in `parse_signed_request` is correctly implemented.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code that would suggest malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report's reasoning and scores:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies standard use, proper HMAC verification, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n*Scores seem reasonable.*\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, correct understanding.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n*Scores seem reasonable.*\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, emphasizes standard API interactions, proper signature verification.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, confidence=1.0.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n*Scores are appropriate.*\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, confidence=0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n*Scores seem appropriate.*\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, mentions proper handling, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, confidence=0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n*Scores are reasonable.*\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential security implications of handling tokens and user data, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.15 (low, due to handling sensitive data, but no evident issues)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- The code is a legitimate SDK implementation with no malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with perhaps a slight adjustment to the overall risk score to 0.15, but the current scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Critical conclusion:**  \n**This code is a legitimate, well-implemented Facebook Graph API client library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise.**",
