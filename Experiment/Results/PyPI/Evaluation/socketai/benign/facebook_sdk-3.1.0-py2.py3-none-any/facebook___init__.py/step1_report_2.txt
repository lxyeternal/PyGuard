{
  "purpose": "A client library to interact with the Facebook Graph API for authentication, data retrieval, and content posting.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user input via method parameters, cookies, and API responses. External requests are made using the requests library.",
  "sinks": "API requests to Facebook servers, particularly in methods like request(), get_access_token_from_code(), and get_auth_url(). These could potentially leak data if misused but are intended for legitimate API interactions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as cookies and method parameters flow into API request methods and authentication functions, leading to outbound requests and response handling.",
  "anomalies": "No evidence of hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns. The code performs standard Facebook API interactions, with proper error handling. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Facebook Graph API client, with functions for fetching user info, permissions, uploading photos, and OAuth flows. It properly handles errors and response types. The parse_signed_request function performs signature verification using HMAC-SHA256, ensuring data integrity. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The use of external requests aligns with intended API communication, with no signs of data exfiltration, malicious command execution, or covert data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Facebook API client library without malicious intent. It securely manages API tokens, performs standard authentication and data access functions, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. No indicators of supply chain attacks or malware are evident.",
