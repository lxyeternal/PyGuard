  "purpose": "Manage configuration settings and API keys for the pandasai library, including handling of language model instances and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'PANDABI_API_KEY' in get() methods; reads input API key in set() method; imports from pandasai.llm and pandasai.helpers.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variable 'PANDABI_API_KEY' to initialize LLM; potentially updates environment variable in set().",
  "flows": "set() updates environment variable and internal API key; get() checks environment variable and initializes LLM if key present; validate_llm() reads environment variable to instantiate LLM.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials in the code itself, no obfuscated code, no unusual behaviors observed. Code uses environment variables and imports standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code manages configuration data and API keys for a language model system. It reads the 'PANDABI_API_KEY' environment variable to initialize an LLM object if not already set, which is a typical pattern for API key management. The API key can be set via the set() method, which updates environment variables. The import statements are standard, importing classes from known modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code relies on environment variables for API keys, which is common practice. No suspicious network activity or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and API key management module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It securely handles API keys via environment variables and manages configuration objects. No malware or supply chain attack vectors are evident.",
