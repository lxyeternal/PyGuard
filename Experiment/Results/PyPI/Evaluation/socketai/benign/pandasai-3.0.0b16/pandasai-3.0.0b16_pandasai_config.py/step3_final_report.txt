  "purpose": "Manage configuration settings and API keys for pandasai, including dynamic LLM loading based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PANDABI_API_KEY', class attribute access, import statements, method parameters",
  "sinks": "Environment variable setting, class attribute updates, dynamic import of LLM classes",
  "flows": "API key set via environment or method -> used in get() for LLM initialization -> dynamic import based on environment variable",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward configuration management",
  "analysis": "The code manages configuration via a singleton pattern, uses environment variables for API keys, and performs dynamic imports of LLM classes. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The environment variable reliance is standard but could be manipulated externally, though this does not constitute malicious intent. The dynamic import is based on known modules, with no external input influencing the import path directly. Overall, the code is benign, with low security risk and no malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration handler with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and risk (0.1-0.2) scores are justified and consistent with best practices.",
