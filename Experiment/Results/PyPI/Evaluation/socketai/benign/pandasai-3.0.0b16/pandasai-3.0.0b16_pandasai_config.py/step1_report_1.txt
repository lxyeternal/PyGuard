  "purpose": "Manage configuration settings and API keys for the pandasai library, including environment-based LLM initialization.",
  "sources": "Environment variable PANDABI_API_KEY, user-provided configuration dictionaries, class attribute setters.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable setting (os.environ), dynamic import of LLM classes, class attribute updates.",
  "flows": "Setting API key -> Environment variable is set; get method -> Checks environment variable to initialize LLM; set configuration -> Updates internal config with user data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. The code performs typical configuration management without hidden or malicious logic. No hardcoded credentials besides the API key, which is set via a method, not embedded.",
  "analysis": "The code manages configurations for a system involving language models, allowing environment-based automatic initialization if an API key is present. It imports components dynamically and manages environment variables securely through methods. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. The code appears to be standard configuration management code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a configuration handler with environment variable reliance for API key management and dynamic LLM instantiation. It does not contain malware or malicious behaviors. Security risks are minimal and typical for configuration management code.",
