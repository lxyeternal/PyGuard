  "purpose": "Manage configuration and API key handling for the pandasai package, including setting and retrieving configuration parameters and API keys.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('PANDABI_API_KEY') for reading the API key environment variable, and class methods for setting internal API key state and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "os.environ['PANDABI_API_KEY']' when setting the API key, and potential use of the API key for authentication with external services.",
  "flows": "API key set via APIKeyManager.set() -> stored in environment and class variable -> read in get() methods to initialize LLM if not provided -> used to authenticate or configure external services.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; environment variable handling appears standard. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors; API key management is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration management classes, allowing setting and retrieving configuration parameters and API keys. API keys are stored in environment variables and class attributes. There are conditional initializations for the LLM based on environment variables. No evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The use of environment variables for API keys is standard practice, and there are no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate configuration and API key management component with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It manages environment variables and class states responsibly without malicious intent.",
