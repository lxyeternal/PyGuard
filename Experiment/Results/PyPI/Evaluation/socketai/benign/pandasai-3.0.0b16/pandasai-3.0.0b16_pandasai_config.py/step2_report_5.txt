  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code manages configuration settings and API keys, with environment-based LLM initialization. No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The low risk score seems appropriate. The malware score of zero aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing environment variable management, standard import practices, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report; no malicious activity detected. The score seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard configuration management with environment variables, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern—configuration handling, environment variable use, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, environment variable management, standard practices, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score, which is reasonable given the consistent benign pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—standard configuration management, environment variable handling, and dynamic imports without any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, these are low and consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Any Issues or Hidden Malicious Logic?**  \n  No. The code does not contain any backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. It simply manages configuration and API keys securely via environment variables and class attributes.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:**  \n  The only minor concern could be the use of environment variables for API keys, which is common but can be risky if environment variables are not managed securely. However, this is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (appropriate given the benign nature)  \n\n- **Overall Security Assessment:**  \n  The code is safe, standard configuration management code with no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified, and the malware scores correctly reflect the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to 0.2, depending on context, but generally very low)\n\n**Conclusion:** No security issues or supply chain risks are present in this code.",
