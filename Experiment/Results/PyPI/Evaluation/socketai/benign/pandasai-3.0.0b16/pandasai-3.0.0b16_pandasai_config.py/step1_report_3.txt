  "purpose": "The code manages configuration settings and API key handling for a pandasai-based application, including environment variable interactions and class-based configuration management.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'PANDABI_API_KEY' in get methods and from external environment during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Modifies environment variables 'PANDABI_API_KEY' and assigns to class variables; potentially affects environment state or exposes sensitive data if misused.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PANDABI_API_KEY' is read during get() in ConfigManager; APIKeyManager.set() writes to environment and class variable; get() reads class variable.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials; environment variable access is standard; no obfuscated code or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration and API key management for a pandasai application. The Config class encapsulates settings, including an optional LLM. ConfigManager manages a singleton Config instance, updating it and initializing a default LLM if 'PANDABI_API_KEY' exists in environment variables. APIKeyManager sets and retrieves the API key, updating environment variables accordingly. All interactions are standard for configuration handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The use of environment variables is typical for API key management. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate configuration management logic with standard environment variable handling for API keys. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
