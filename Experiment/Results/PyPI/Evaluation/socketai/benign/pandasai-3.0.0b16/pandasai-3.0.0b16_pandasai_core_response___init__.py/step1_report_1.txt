{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various response classes and a parser, then exposes them via __all__ for external use. It likely serves as an interface or API component for handling different types of responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads imported classes and a list of string literals defining __all__.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exported; no external data handling, network calls, or environment variables are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely performs static imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements for classes from local modules and a list __all__ that exposes these classes. It functions as an API module, providing organized access to response types and a parser. There is no dynamic code execution, no handling of external inputs, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module that imports and re-exports classes for use elsewhere. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscated code. Overall, it appears to be a standard, safe module with no malicious intent.",
