  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality Confirmation:**\n   - The code imports `importlib.metadata` and assigns the version of the current package/module to `__version__`.\n   - All reports agree that this is a standard, minimal, and straightforward pattern for version retrieval.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data flows.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data sinks, external communications, or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code only retrieves package metadata and assigns it to a variable, with no external communication, no code execution beyond reading metadata, and no obfuscation, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code as standard practice, with no malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code is a common pattern used in Python packages for version retrieval.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and carries no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and overall risk.",
