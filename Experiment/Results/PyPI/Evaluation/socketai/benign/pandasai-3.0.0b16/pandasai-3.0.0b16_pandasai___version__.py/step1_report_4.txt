  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the current package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version of the package or module using importlib.metadata.version() with __package__ or __name__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only accesses package metadata.",
  "flows": "The source (importing version info) does not flow into any sink; it simply assigns the version string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual constructs or obfuscated elements. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata to obtain the version number of the current package or module. It assigns this version to __version__, which is a common practice for package versioning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code performs a benign operation typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard way to programmatically access package version information and poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
