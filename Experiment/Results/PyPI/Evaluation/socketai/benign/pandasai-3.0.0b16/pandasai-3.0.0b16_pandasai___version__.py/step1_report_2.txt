  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the current package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package or module name using __package__ or __name__, then calls importlib.metadata.version to obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any data sinks or outputs that could leak untrusted data or affect the system.",
  "flows": "Input source (__package__ or __name__) → importlib.metadata.version function call (to get version info). No untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs a straightforward retrieval of package metadata. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions to obtain package version information. The use of importlib.metadata.version is safe and common. It relies on the package or module name and fetches version data without executing untrusted code or communicating externally. No suspicious behaviors or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe snippet for obtaining version info of a package or module. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
