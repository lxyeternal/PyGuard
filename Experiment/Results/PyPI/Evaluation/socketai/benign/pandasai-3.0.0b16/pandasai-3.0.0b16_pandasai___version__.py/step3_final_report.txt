  "purpose": "Retrieve the current package or module version information using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(__package__ or __name__)",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads package metadata, no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input: __package__ or __name__; Output: __version__ variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and assigns the version of the current package or module to __version__ using importlib.metadata.version(). It employs __package__ or __name__ to identify the package. No external inputs, network calls, or data sinks are involved. The code is a common pattern for version retrieval, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The only potential edge case is if the package is not installed, which would raise an exception, but this does not indicate malicious intent or security risk. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence in these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for obtaining package version information in Python. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and overall risk.",
