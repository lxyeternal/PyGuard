  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which uses `importlib.metadata.version()` to retrieve the version of the current package or module.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and employs standard Python practices.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or data sinks are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Confirming the code's correctness and security:**\n- The code correctly uses `importlib.metadata.version()` with `__package__` or `__name__`, which is a common pattern for obtaining package version info.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as executing untrusted code, leaking data, or obfuscation.\n- The purpose is purely informational, with no side effects or security concerns.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious activities.\n\n**Potential issues or misjudgments:**\n- No issues are detected in the logic, reasoning, or summary.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe pattern for obtaining package version information.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet poses no security threat or malicious intent. It is a typical utility code used in Python packages for version tracking.",
