  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the current package or module",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version reading the version of __package__ or __name__",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this code",
  "flows": "Source (importlib.metadata.version) retrieves data from package metadata based on __package__ or __name__",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, no anomalies or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata to obtain the version of the current package or module. It uses __package__ or __name__ to determine which package or module to get the version for. The retrieved version is assigned to __version__, a common practice for version tracking in Python modules. No user input, network operations, or external data flows are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard approach to obtaining package version information with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
