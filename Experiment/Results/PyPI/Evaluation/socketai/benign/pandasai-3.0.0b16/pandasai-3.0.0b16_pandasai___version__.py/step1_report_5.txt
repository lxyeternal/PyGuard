  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only retrieves metadata and assigns it to __version__.",
  "flows": "Data flows from importlib.metadata.version() to __version__, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward use of importlib.metadata to obtain version info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and uses it to retrieve the version of the current package or module. It checks whether __package__ or __name__ is set and retrieves the version accordingly. The code performs a standard operation for version retrieval without any suspicious or malicious constructs. There are no inputs from external sources, no data flows to external sinks, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign snippet used for obtaining package or module version information. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
