  "purpose": "Define a base class for response objects with serialization capabilities.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters: value, type, last_code_executed, error; usage of json.dumps for serialization.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps (potential for data exposure if untrusted data is serialized without sanitization).",
  "flows": "Initialization assigns parameters; to_json calls json.dumps on the dictionary representation of the object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with input validation for 'value' and 'type', raising exceptions if they are None. No external or untrusted data handling other than internal parameter assignment. The to_json method uses json.dumps with a custom encoder, which could pose a risk if 'value' or other attributes contain malicious data, but this is standard serialization. No code execution, network communication, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward data container with serialization methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical response object model with serialization; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No security risks beyond standard data serialization concerns.",
