  "purpose": "Defines a base class for response objects with validation, string representation, and JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the __init__ method: value, type, last_code_executed, error.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() in to_json() method, which serializes the object to JSON.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> __init__ validation -> object attributes -> to_json() serialization -> json.dumps()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of json.dumps with a custom encoder is standard for JSON serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that validates its input parameters and provides methods for string, representation, and JSON serialization. It relies on a custom JSON encoder, which may introduce risk if the encoder is malicious, but this cannot be determined from the given code. The validation ensures 'value' and 'type' are not None, preventing some injection vectors. No untrusted data sources, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The serialization process appears standard, with no signs of malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured class for handling responses. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code snippet. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident.",
