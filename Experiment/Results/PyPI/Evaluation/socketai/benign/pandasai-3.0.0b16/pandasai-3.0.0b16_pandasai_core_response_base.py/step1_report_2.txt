  "purpose": "Define a base class for response objects that encapsulate response data and related metadata, with serialization support.",
  "sources": "Input parameters of the __init__ method: value, type, last_code_executed, error",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() in to_json method, which serializes the object to a JSON string",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> constructor validation -> object attributes -> to_dict() -> json.dumps() in to_json()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. Use of custom JSON encoder is standard for handling complex objects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with validation on critical parameters (value and type). It provides methods for string, representation, dictionary, and JSON serialization. No suspicious dynamic code execution, external network activity, or obfuscated logic is present. The use of a custom JSON encoder is typical for specialized serialization needs. There are no evident signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of a response wrapper with serialization capabilities. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
