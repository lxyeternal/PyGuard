{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for handling response objects with JSON serialization",
  "sources": "None (no input reading beyond initialization parameters)",
  "sinks": "json.dumps (potentially vulnerable if data is malicious, but in this context it is just serialization)",
  "flows": "Data stored in object attributes flows into to_dict() then into json.dumps()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated logic, no external code execution",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with parameters that are checked for None, raising errors if invalid. The methods provide string and JSON representations, utilizing a custom JSON encoder. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, or suspicious behavior. The import of CustomJsonEncoder might be relevant if it performs unsafe operations, but in isolation, it's standard practice for custom serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data container with serialization methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
