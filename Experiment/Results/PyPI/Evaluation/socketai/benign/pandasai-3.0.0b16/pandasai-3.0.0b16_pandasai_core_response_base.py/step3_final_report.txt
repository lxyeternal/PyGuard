{
  "purpose": "A simple response container class with validation and serialization support.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'value' and 'last_code_executed'; uses CustomJsonEncoder during JSON serialization.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() output; potential if CustomJsonEncoder is malicious, but not evident here.",
  "flows": "Initialization validates 'value' and 'type'; to_json() serializes object via CustomJsonEncoder.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The class validates critical fields to prevent None values, provides string and debug representations, and serializes data using a custom encoder. No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The use of CustomJsonEncoder is standard unless maliciously implemented, which cannot be assessed here. The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured response object with validation and serialization features. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
