  "purpose": "A simple data container class for user queries with a typo bug in __repr__.",
  "sources": "Initialization of self.value; __str__, __repr__, __dict__, and to_json methods accessing self.value.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input/output or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Input string assigned to self.value; methods return self.value; __repr__ incorrectly references self._value.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in __repr__ referencing undefined attribute self._value; __dict__ returns a string instead of a dict.",
  "analysis": "The class stores a string in self.value and provides methods to access it. The __repr__ method references self._value, which does not exist, leading to potential runtime errors. No network, file, or data leakage operations are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The main issue is a typo bug that should be corrected. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a minor bug in __repr__ that causes a runtime error but no security risk. All reports correctly identify the bug and assign low malware and obfuscation scores. The overall security risk score should remain very low (~0.1) due to the typo bug, which is not malicious. Fixing the typo is recommended for robustness, but the code does not pose any security threat.",
