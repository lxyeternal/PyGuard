{
  "purpose": "Defines a UserQuery class to store and represent user query strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'user_query' in __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks; the class methods return or format the stored data without external output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the constructor (__init__) into the 'value' attribute, then is used in __str__, __repr__, __dict__, and to_json methods.",
  "anomalies": "The __repr__ method references self._value, but the attribute is stored as self.value, which could cause an AttributeError. No signs of malicious code or secret leakage. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data container class for user queries with basic string representations. The __repr__ method appears incorrectly implemented due to referencing an undefined attribute '_value', which could cause runtime errors but not malicious behavior. No input validation, external data handling, or network activity is present. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for handling user query strings with a minor bug in __repr__, but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
