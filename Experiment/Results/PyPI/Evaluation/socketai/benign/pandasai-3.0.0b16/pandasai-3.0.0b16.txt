      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes with no security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. It does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited. The import of 'PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE' is harmless and unused. Overall, the code poses no security risk and is purely structural."

      "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk stems from remote dataset fetching with environment-managed API keys, which is standard but should be handled securely. Overall, the code is safe for use, with no signs of malware or sabotage."

All reports correctly identify the bug and assign low malware and obfuscation scores. The overall security risk score should remain very low (~0.1) due to the typo bug, which is not malicious. Fixing the typo is recommended for robustness, but the code does not pose any security threat."
