{
  "purpose": "Parse and validate response data of types number, string, dataframe, plot, and instantiate corresponding response objects.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary 'result' with keys 'type' and 'value'; regex pattern for plot path validation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; validation prevents invalid data formats; regex checks paths but does not execute or write files.",
  "flows": "Input 'result' flows through validation; upon passing, creates specific response objects based on 'type'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; regex for path validation is standard; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation of input data types and formats, including regex path validation for plots. It raises exceptions for invalid data, ensuring data integrity. No external system interactions, code execution, or network activity are present. The regex pattern used is standard for path validation and does not suggest malicious intent. Imports are typical for data handling. The overall logic is clear, and the validation is robust, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe response parser and validator with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) is justified given the minimal validation scope and absence of external operations.",
