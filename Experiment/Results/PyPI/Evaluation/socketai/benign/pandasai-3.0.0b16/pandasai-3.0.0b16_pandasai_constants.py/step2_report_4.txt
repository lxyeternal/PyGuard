  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely configuration: constants, documentation strings, lists, and dictionaries.\n- No dynamic input handling, network calls, or data processing.\n- Environment variables are mentioned only in documentation and setup instructions, not accessed directly in the code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.\n- The only sensitive mention is the instruction to set an environment variable for the API key, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no secrets, no malicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0.0 is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 is reasonable; no active vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, well justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as Report 1, emphasizing that only static configuration and documentation are present.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0.0 makes sense.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, no code that performs sensitive operations or malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware remains 0.0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Findings:** Consistent with prior assessments; static configuration, no malicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0.0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Findings:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), citing the mention of environment variables for API keys.\n- **Analysis:** The mention of environment variables is standard practice, not an active vulnerability. No code accesses or manipulates environment variables directly.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 is justified; no malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** The 0.1 score might be a conservative acknowledgment that environment variables, if mishandled elsewhere, could pose risks, but within this code snippet, it's benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable. The mention of environment variables is only instructional, not operational code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are correctly set to 0.0, as no malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0.0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0.0 or very close, reflecting no real security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\nGiven the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is purely configuration and documentation, with no active or latent security issues.\n\n**Final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, standard configuration code with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
