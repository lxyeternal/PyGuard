  "anomalies": [
    "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present",
    "No obfuscated or malicious code detected",
    "The setup message instructs on API key configuration but does not perform any malicious actions"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of constant definitions and configuration data for the pandasai package. It includes paths, messages, and supported data source types. No user input handling, network calls, or sensitive operations are performed within this snippet. Environment variable mention in comments and setup instructions is standard practice. The default API URL and permissions are typical. No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward configuration code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly defines constants and documentation strings without performing any risky operations.",
