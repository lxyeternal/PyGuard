{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, default settings, supported data sources, and transformation types for the pandasai package.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (implied through environment variable mention), and potentially external configuration via API key setup instructions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no direct untrusted data sinks, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No dynamic data flows observed; mostly static configuration constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code. The environment variable mention is a common practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains constant definitions, static configuration strings, and lists/dictionaries specifying supported sources, data types, and transformations. It includes user instructions for setting an API key via environment variables, which is standard. No dynamic execution, external code loading, or suspicious logic is present. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration/constants module with no malicious intent or security risks. It provides metadata and setup instructions for the pandasai package, without any suspicious or harmful code patterns.",
