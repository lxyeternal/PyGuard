{
  "purpose": "Define constants, configuration messages, supported data sources, and data transformation types for the pandasai package.",
  "sources": "Environment variable access (not directly shown in code, but implied by the instructions for setting API keys), and string constants used in the package.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of API keys via environment variables, though the code only mentions setting environment variables externally. No direct sinks such as network connections or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are present within this code snippet; it mainly defines static constants and configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets (beyond API URLs and instructions), or suspicious behaviors are present. The code consists solely of constant definitions and user instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets constants and configuration information for the pandasai package. It includes default URLs, directory paths, permissions, user instructions for API key setup, and lists of supported data sources and transformation types. There are no dynamic inputs, external data reads, or network operations within this code. The environment variable mention is for user guidance rather than code-based data access. Overall, the code appears to be standard configuration and documentation with no malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely configuration and documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It provides setup instructions and constants for the package’s operation without any suspicious or harmful code.",
