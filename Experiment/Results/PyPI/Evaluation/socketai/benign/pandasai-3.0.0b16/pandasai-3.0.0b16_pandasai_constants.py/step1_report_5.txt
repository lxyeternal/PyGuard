{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration options used in the pandasai package, including API URLs, file permissions, environment variable instructions, supported data sources, and transformation types.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (implied in documentation, not actual code), file path manipulations via os.path.join.",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted input or perform sensitive operations directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly sets constants and configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The only potentially sensitive information is the instruction to set environment variables for API keys, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and configuration data for the pandasai package, including URLs, directory paths, permissions, message templates, supported source types, and transformation options. It does not include any dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing that could be malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads. The only potential concern is the documentation indicating environment variable usage for API keys, which is a standard and secure practice, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration/constants module with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily serves as a static reference for other parts of the package, with no active data processing or external interactions that could be exploited.",
