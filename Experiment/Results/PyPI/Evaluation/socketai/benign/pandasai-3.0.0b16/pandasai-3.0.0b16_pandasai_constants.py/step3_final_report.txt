  "purpose": "Define constants, configuration parameters, and documentation for the pandasai package, including API URL, directory paths, supported data sources, and transformation types.",
  "sources": "Environment variable instructions in the setup message, constants defining URLs, directory paths, supported source types, and transformation types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or processing points; code only contains static definitions and documentation.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; code is static configuration with no dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The mention of environment variables is standard and only in comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely configuration and documentation, with no active logic, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. It references environment variables for API keys but does not access or manipulate them directly. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The environment variable mention is standard practice for API key management. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate low security risk and malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The mention of environment variables is standard and does not pose a security risk. All signals indicate a safe, non-malicious code snippet.",
