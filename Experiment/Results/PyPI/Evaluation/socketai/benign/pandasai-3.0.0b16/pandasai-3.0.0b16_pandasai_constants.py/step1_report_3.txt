  "purpose": "Define constants, configuration options, supported data sources, and transformation types for the pandasai package.",
  "sources": "Environment variable PANDABI_API_KEY (mentioned in comments), and os.environ['PANDABI_API_KEY'] (as an example of setting environment variable).",
  "sinks": "None directly, but the code references environment variables for API keys and constructs file paths based on constants.",
  "flows": "Suggested flow involves reading the API key from environment variables, using constants for file paths, and referencing supported connectors and data types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded credentials beyond a reference to setting an environment variable, and no dynamic code execution. The code primarily defines static configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various constants and dictionaries for configuration and supported options in the pandasai package. It references environment variables for API keys but does not contain code that reads or processes these variables directly. The constants are static strings and lists with no indication of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious code segments are present. The only sensitive mention is the environment variable for API key, which is a common practice and not malicious by itself. There are no apparent code injection points, data leaks, or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration module defining constants and supported data sources/types. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The reference to environment variables is standard for API key management. Overall, it appears safe and standard.",
