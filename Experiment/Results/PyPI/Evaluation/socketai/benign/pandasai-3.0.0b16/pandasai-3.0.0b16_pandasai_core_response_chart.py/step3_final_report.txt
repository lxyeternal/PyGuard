  "purpose": "Utility class for handling images, decoding base64 strings or opening images from file paths/URLs, and providing methods to save, display, and convert images to base64.",
  "sources": "self.value (input image data or path/URL)",
  "sinks": "Image.open() and img.save() (file operations), img.show() (display)",
  "flows": "self.value (source) -> _get_image() -> Image.open() or base64 decoding -> save/show/convert methods (sinks)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Input validation is minimal but standard for such utility.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing tasks: decoding base64 data URIs or opening images from paths/URLs using PIL. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The input 'value' is untrusted but handled safely within the scope of image processing. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected. The operations are straightforward and rely on well-known libraries. The code does not execute any code beyond image handling, and no external network calls are made. The potential risk is processing malicious images, but this is a common concern with image libraries and not specific to this code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for image decoding and handling, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The security risk and malware scores are justified as zero, and the code is safe for use.",
