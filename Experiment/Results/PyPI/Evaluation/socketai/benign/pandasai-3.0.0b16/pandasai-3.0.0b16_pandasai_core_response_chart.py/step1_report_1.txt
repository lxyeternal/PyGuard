  "purpose": "A class to handle chart responses, including converting base64 data to images, displaying, saving, and encoding images.",
  "sources": "The 'value' attribute, which may contain image data or a URL, and the 'last_code_executed' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Image.open(), img.save(), img.show(), base64.b64decode(), base64.b64encode()",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is processed in _get_image() to produce an image object; save(), show(), and get_base64_image() use this image object for output or encoding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no dynamic code execution, no unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles image data, decoding base64 strings or opening images from URLs or file paths. It includes methods to save, display, and convert images to base64 format. The image decoding uses standard libraries (base64, io, PIL), with no user input validation beyond the initial check for 'data:image' prefix. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions. The code appears to be a utility class for image handling, and all operations are standard for such functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs image processing functions with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior and is consistent with expected functionality for image handling.",
