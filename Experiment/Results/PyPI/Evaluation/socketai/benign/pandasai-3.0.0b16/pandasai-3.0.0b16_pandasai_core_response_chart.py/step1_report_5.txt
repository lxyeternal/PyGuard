  "purpose": "Handle chart images, including decoding from base64, saving, displaying, and converting to base64.",
  "sources": "self.value (image data or base64-encoded image), input parameters for save() and show()",
  "sinks": "Image.open(), img.save(), img.show(), base64.b64decode(), base64.b64encode()",
  "flows": "self.value (source) -> _get_image() -> Image.open() or io.BytesIO() -> save/show/get_base64_image()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network activity, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code securely processes image data, decoding base64 strings when necessary, and performs standard image operations. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. Usage of standard libraries (PIL, base64, io) for image handling is typical. No unsafe inputs or outputs are evident. The code simply processes image data supplied to it and does not perform any network activity or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign image processing utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It handles images securely using standard libraries without suspicious patterns.",
