  "purpose": "Handle image data, including decoding base64-encoded images and saving or displaying them.",
  "sources": "self.value (input image data or base64 string)",
  "sinks": "Image.open(), img.save(), img.show()",
  "flows": "self.value -> _get_image() -> Image.open(), save(), show(), get_base64_image()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code processes image data, decoding base64-encoded images if necessary and providing methods to save, display, or get the image as a base64 string. The source of data is self.value, which is either a raw image path or a data URI. The image data is decoded only if it is a data URI. Image handling is performed via the PIL library, which is standard for image processing. No external network connections, suspicious data handling, or insecure operations are present. The code structure is straightforward, with clear source-to-sink flows and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for handling image data with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
