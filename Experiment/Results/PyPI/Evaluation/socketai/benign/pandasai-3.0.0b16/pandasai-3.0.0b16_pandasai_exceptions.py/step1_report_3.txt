{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the PandaAI library to handle various error scenarios.",
  "sources": "Import of PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE from pandasai.constants, and all class definitions including __init__ methods that set exception messages.",
  "sinks": "None directly; exception messages are constructed and raised but do not send untrusted data over the network or leak information.",
  "flows": "Triggering errors during invalid operations, missing resources, or unsupported features; no data flow from external inputs to sensitive sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Exception classes are standard, with no obfuscated code, network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for handling errors within the PandaAI library. All exceptions are standard Python classes inheriting from Exception or its subclasses, with optional custom messages. No code injection, external network activity, or malicious logic is present. The import from pandasai.constants is benign and used only for reference. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are found. The structure is straightforward and typical for a well-designed error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines error classes for internal use within the PandaAI framework. The code appears safe and does not facilitate any supply chain attack or malicious activity.",
