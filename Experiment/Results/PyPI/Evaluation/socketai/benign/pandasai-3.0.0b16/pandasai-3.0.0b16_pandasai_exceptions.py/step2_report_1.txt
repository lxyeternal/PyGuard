  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines numerous custom exception classes for error handling within the PandaAI project.\n   - These classes inherit from Python's built-in Exception or related classes.\n   - Some classes include __init__ methods to set specific error messages or store parameters.\n   - The import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE` from `pandasai.constants` is present but not used elsewhere in this snippet.\n   - The code is static, with no external data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Concerns**:\n   - The code contains no user input handling, data flow from untrusted sources, or execution of external code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code patterns are present.\n   - The import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE` is benign and unused, which is not suspicious.\n   - Exception classes are purely structural and do not perform any operations that could be exploited maliciously.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions.\n   - They note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The confidence level is high (1.0), and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code serves as internal error handling and does not process external or untrusted data.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n   - **Risk Score**: Given the benign nature, a low risk score (close to 0) is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Misinterpretations**:\n   - The only minor point is the import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE`, which is unused. This is not harmful but could be flagged as unnecessary. However, it does not impact security.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are justified here, as the code is purely class definitions.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion**:\n   - The code is a standard, well-structured exception module with no security vulnerabilities.\n   - It does not facilitate supply chain attacks, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware Score**: Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score**: Keep at 0 or very close to it, as the code is purely structural.\n\n**My personal estimate** aligns with the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n**Summary**: The code is benign, standard exception class definitions with no security issues. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
