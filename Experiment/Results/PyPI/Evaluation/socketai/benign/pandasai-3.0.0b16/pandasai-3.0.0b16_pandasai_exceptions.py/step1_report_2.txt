{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for the PandaAI library to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data from external sources directly. It defines classes that may be instantiated when errors occur.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths involving untrusted data are evident, as this is a set of exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies or suspicious code patterns. All classes are standard exception definitions with no unusual behaviors. There are no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of custom exception classes for error handling within the PandaAI package. All classes inherit from Python's Exception or specific built-in errors, with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. The only notable function is the __init__ method in some classes, which simply formats error messages or stores parameters. There are no external calls, network operations, or security-sensitive actions performed. The structure and content are typical for a well-organized exception module. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes for internal error handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
