{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for the PandaAI project, mainly for error handling and specific failure conditions.",
  "sources": "The code defines exception classes and imports a constant from pandasai.constants, which is used only for documentation purposes in the exceptions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flow points where untrusted data could be exploited or lead to malicious actions. The code only defines exception classes and messages.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks are present, as this code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions. The only potential concern is the import of PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE, but it is not used elsewhere and appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code contains numerous custom exception classes for various error conditions in the PandaAI application. All classes are standard and only define error types or messages. No user input or external data is processed or executed here. There are no obfuscated elements, code injections, or malicious behavior. The import of a constant from another module is benign and unused within this code snippet. Overall, the code serves purely as a structured error handling mechanism without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities in this code. It is a well-structured set of exception classes intended for error handling in the application. No supply chain or security attack vectors are identifiable here.",
