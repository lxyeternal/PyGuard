{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes used throughout the PandaAI package for error handling and specific failure cases.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from its internal class constructors, exception messages, and imported constants such as PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe actions; it primarily raises exceptions with static or parameterized messages.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; exceptions are raised based on internal logic and input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident. The code strictly defines exception classes with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of numerous custom exception classes for handling specific errors within PandaAI, such as missing API keys, unsupported models, or malicious code generation. All classes are straightforward, with constructors that set messages or store parameters. There are no apparent sources of untrusted data being processed or propagated to sinks. The only imported element is a constant, which is not suspicious. No dynamic code, eval, exec, or obfuscated logic is present. The purpose is purely for structured error handling. Since the code is a set of exception definitions, it lacks functionality that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It does not perform any actions beyond raising errors and does not handle untrusted input or include malicious payloads.",
