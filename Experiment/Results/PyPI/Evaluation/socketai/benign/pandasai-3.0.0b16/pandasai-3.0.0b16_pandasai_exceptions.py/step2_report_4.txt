  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes for error handling.\n   - No external data is processed, no network calls, no code execution, no obfuscation.\n   - The import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE` from `pandasai.constants` is unused, but benign.\n   - No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent: all identify that the code is purely exception class definitions.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, external inputs, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No misinterpretations or logical flaws are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The only minor point is the import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE`, which is unused. This does not impact security.\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any suspicion of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard exception module with no security risks.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No modifications are necessary; the code is safe.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or attack vectors)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of custom exception classes. The reports are accurate and comprehensive. There are no security concerns, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present.",
