  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions.\n   - No external data processing, input handling, or network operations are present.\n   - The import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE` from `pandasai.constants` is unused and benign.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling and contains no malicious activity.\n   - They note the absence of data flows involving untrusted input, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - The only minor point is the import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE`, which is unused, but this is not a security concern.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Claims about Potential Vulnerabilities:**\n   - No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are present; the analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the detailed reasoning provided.\n\n6. **Additional Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes without any dynamic or external data processing, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The malware score remains at 0 because there is no malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score remains at 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign exception module.\n   - No security vulnerabilities, malicious code, or supply chain attack vectors are evident.\n   - The import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE` is unused but harmless.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately assess the security posture of this code. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a well-structured, safe set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security risk elements. It does not process untrusted data, perform external calls, or contain obfuscated logic. The scores reflect this correctly.",
