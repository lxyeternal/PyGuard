  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and evaluate the security implications of this code.\n\n**1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this module only defines custom exception classes for error handling. There are no indications of malicious code, data processing, or external data handling. The import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE` is noted but unused, which is benign.\n\n**2. Identify and record any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary.**  \nThe reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. They acknowledge the import of a constant but correctly state it is unused and harmless. No logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n**3. Review the scores given to each issue.**  \nAll reports assign:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\nThese are reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n**4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5.**  \nSince the code only contains class definitions for exceptions, with no external data processing, network activity, or code execution, the risk score should remain at 0. The reports are consistent in this regard.\n\n**5. Challenge any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions.**  \nNo assumptions are made that could lead to false positives. The analysis correctly notes the absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or external input handling.\n\n**6. Ensure the scores are consistent with the report.**  \nScores are consistent across all reports and align with the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is purely a set of exception class definitions.  \n- No external input, data processing, or network activity occurs.  \n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- The import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE` is unused and harmless.  \n- The exception classes are standard and do not pose any security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. It serves as a structured error handling mechanism within the PandaAI project.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are accurate and thorough.  \n- The code is safe and does not introduce any supply chain or security risks.  \n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scoring: all zeroes, reflecting the benign nature of this exception module.",
