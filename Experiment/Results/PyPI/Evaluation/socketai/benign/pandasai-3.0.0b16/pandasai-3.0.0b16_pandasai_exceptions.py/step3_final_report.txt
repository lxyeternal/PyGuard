{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for error handling within the PandaAI project, facilitating structured error management.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as the code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE' from 'pandasai.constants' is unused, which is unnecessary but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various custom exceptions, with some classes including __init__ methods to set specific messages or store parameters. There are no external data inputs, network calls, code execution, or obfuscation. The import of 'PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE' is benign and unused. The exception classes serve as structural error indicators and do not perform any operations that could be exploited maliciously. The absence of dynamic code, data processing, or external dependencies indicates a benign, static code base.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes with no security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. It does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited. The import of 'PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE' is harmless and unused. Overall, the code poses no security risk and is purely structural.",
