  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines a comprehensive set of custom exception classes for error handling within the PandaAI project.\n   - No external input is processed, no data flows, no network calls, and no code execution occurs within this module.\n   - The import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE` from `pandasai.constants` is unused and benign; it does not influence security or functionality here.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code is purely for exception handling and does not contain malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are noted in the reports.\n   - The reports appropriately dismiss concerns about obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious code, given the nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct. There is no malicious code or behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since this is error handling code without any security implications.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The only minor point is the import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE`, which is unused here. This does not pose a security risk.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly conclude the code is benign.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n6. **Overall Justification:**\n   - Given that this module only defines exception classes, there is no attack surface or malicious activity.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or supply chain attack vectors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured exception module with no security concerns.\n- The import of `PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE` could be removed if unused, but it does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThis code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the code's nature.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
