  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes with no security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. It does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited. The import of 'PANDABI_SETUP_MESSAGE' is harmless and unused. Overall, the code poses no security risk and is purely structural."
