{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes used throughout the PandaAI codebase for error handling and signaling specific issues.",
  "sources": "The code defines exception classes, mainly their __init__ methods and docstrings, without reading external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute sensitive actions directly.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as this code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are present. Exception class definitions are standard. The only noteworthy element is the default message in PandaAIApiKeyError, which is typical for missing API key errors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for various error conditions within the PandaAI system. These classes include constructors and docstrings explaining their purposes. There are no inputs, outputs, or external data handling; the code is static and serves as error signaling mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious code constructs. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive information are present. The default message in PandaAIApiKeyError is appropriate and does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining custom exceptions and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for error handling purposes.",
