  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various file-related errors, extending built-in Python exceptions.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code; it solely defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only contains class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Redefinition of standard Python exceptions with multiple inheritance; potential for confusion but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom error classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, possibly to standardize error handling. No input handling, no data processing, no network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The multiple inheritance from both Error and standard exceptions could cause confusion but is not malicious. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines custom exception classes for file-related errors with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or data leakage.",
