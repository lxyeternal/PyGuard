  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various file system errors, extending built-in exceptions.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; all class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths, as the code only declares class hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant inheritance from standard exceptions; no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines several exception classes inheriting from both a custom base Error class and Python's built-in exceptions. This pattern ensures custom handling but does not involve any dynamic code, data processing, or suspicious activities. No input/output, external data sources, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be purely for structured exception handling and is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
