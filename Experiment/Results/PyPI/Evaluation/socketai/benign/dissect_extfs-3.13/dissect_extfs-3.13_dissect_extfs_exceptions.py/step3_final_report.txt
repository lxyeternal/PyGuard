  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for filesystem errors, inheriting from a base Error class and standard Python filesystem exceptions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Error and standard exceptions; no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Redefinition of standard exceptions (FileNotFoundError, IsADirectoryError, NotADirectoryError) with the same names, which can cause confusion or override default behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom exception classes inheriting from both a custom Error class and standard filesystem exceptions. There is no active malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The main concern is the pattern of redefining standard exceptions with the same names, which could be exploited to interfere with normal error handling routines. This pattern is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The code is straightforward and benign in isolation, with no network activity or payloads. The redefinition pattern warrants caution as it can be misused in malicious contexts to trap or mislead error handling. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.4 due to the potential for misuse of exception redefinition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. The primary concern is the redefinition of standard exceptions with the same names, which could be exploited maliciously if used improperly. Overall, the code is safe but should be reviewed if integrated into larger systems where such patterns could be exploited.",
