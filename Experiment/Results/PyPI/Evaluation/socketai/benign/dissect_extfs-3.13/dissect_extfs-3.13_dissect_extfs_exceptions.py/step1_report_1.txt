  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for filesystem-related errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways, as this is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Redefinition of standard exceptions with custom names, which could lead to confusion but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom exception classes that extend both a base Error class and standard Python filesystem exceptions. This pattern may be used for custom error handling but does not contain any malicious behavior. No input, output, or external interactions are present. The code is purely structural and does not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for filesystem errors without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be intended for clearer or more specific error handling in a larger application.",
