  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various filesystem-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink occurs as there are no operational statements or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code redefines standard Python exceptions (FileNotFoundError, IsADirectoryError, NotADirectoryError) by creating subclasses with the same names, which can cause confusion or override standard behaviors. This is a suspicious practice as it may interfere with normal exception handling and could be used maliciously to trap or mislead error handling mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom exception classes that inherit from both a generic Error class and specific built-in exceptions. The redefinition of standard exceptions with identical names could be exploited to suppress or intercept filesystem errors, or to confuse error handling routines. No malicious code such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors is present. The code itself is simple class definitions but the pattern of redefining built-in exceptions warrants caution, as it may be used in malicious contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines custom exceptions, but the redefinition of standard exceptions with the same names is suspicious and could be used maliciously to override or interfere with normal error handling. No active malicious behavior is present in these class definitions alone, but this pattern is a potential indicator of malicious intent if used improperly.",
