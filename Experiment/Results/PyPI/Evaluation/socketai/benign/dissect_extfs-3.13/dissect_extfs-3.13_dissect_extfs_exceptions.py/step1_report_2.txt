  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to file system errors for use in larger Python projects.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; all class definitions",
  "sinks": "No data output or data handling; no untrusted data sinks",
  "flows": "No data flow; class inheritance definitions only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard class inheritance with exception chaining",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions and a base Error class. These classes are used for handling specific filesystem-related errors. There is no code that reads external input, connects to external systems, or manipulates data in a way that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. The class structure is standard for exception handling in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines custom exception classes for filesystem errors without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
