  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines filesystem structures and constants for ext2/3/4, loaded from static strings. No external input or dynamic code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or output; purely data definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign set of data structures for filesystem parsing, with no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is static, purely declarative, and intended for filesystem analysis. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on defining structures/constants for ext filesystems, with no dynamic or external data handling.  \n- No suspicious logic, no obfuscation, no data leaks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0  \n\n**Justification:**  \nSame reasoning as Report 1. No malicious intent, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, a set of static definitions and mappings for ext filesystem structures and features.\n- No dynamic code, no input/output, no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0  \n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is purely declarative for parsing purposes, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, defining structures, constants, and mappings for filesystem analysis.\n- No runtime logic, no external data processing.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0  \n\n**Justification:**  \nStatic definitions only, no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Also describes static structure definitions for ext filesystems, no input/output or dynamic behavior.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0  \n\n**Justification:**  \nConsistent with prior reports, the code is a static, descriptive module.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static data structure definitions, constants, and mappings. There are no functions, no dynamic code, no external data processing, and no runtime logic that could be exploited or malicious.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:**  \n  The assigned scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0 across reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Risk Justification:**  \n  Since the code is static and purely declarative, the risk scores should remain at 0. Any higher score would imply potential malicious intent or vulnerabilities, which are not supported by the code content.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:**  \n  Both are correctly scored as 0, as there is no obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code appears to be a benign, static library for filesystem structure parsing, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a straightforward, static collection of filesystem structure definitions with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
