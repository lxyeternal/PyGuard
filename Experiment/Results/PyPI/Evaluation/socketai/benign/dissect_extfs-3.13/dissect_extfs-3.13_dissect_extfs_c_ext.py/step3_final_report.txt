  "purpose": "Static definitions of ext2/3/4 filesystem structures, constants, and attribute mappings for filesystem parsing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Predefined macro strings and static structure definitions loaded into a cstruct object.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; purely static data structures without data flow or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static macro definitions, structure declarations, and mappings related to filesystem metadata. It loads these definitions into a cstruct object for potential use in filesystem parsing or forensic tools. There are no dynamic elements, no input handling, no network or file I/O, and no executable logic that could be malicious. The purpose appears to be for static analysis or data interpretation of filesystem images. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static library of filesystem structure definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is suitable for use in filesystem analysis tools and does not pose any threat.",
