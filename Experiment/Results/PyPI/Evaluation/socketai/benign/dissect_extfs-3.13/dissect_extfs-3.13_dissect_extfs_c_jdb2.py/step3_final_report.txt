  "purpose": "Static definitions of macros and structures for parsing JBD2 filesystem journal data, intended for forensic or filesystem analysis tools.",
  "sources": "Macros, constant definitions, and C struct declarations loaded via dissect.cstruct from static string data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; static schema definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "None; code consists solely of static macro and structure definitions with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining constants and data structures for filesystem journaling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or dynamic processing. The malware score is appropriately zero, reflecting no malicious intent. The security risk score is very low (around 0.1), justified by the static, non-executable nature of the code. Confidence levels are high, given the straightforward and well-understood purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a schema for filesystem journal parsing. All reports correctly identify its static, non-malicious nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
