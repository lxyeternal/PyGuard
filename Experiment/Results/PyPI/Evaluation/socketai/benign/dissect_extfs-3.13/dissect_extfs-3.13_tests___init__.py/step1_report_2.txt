  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some standard functionality with no immediately obvious malicious intent. It is likely a utility or library code.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, file inputs, or function parameters; possibly reads network responses or system info depending on implementation.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to files, network connections, or logs; may write to system files or send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, files, user input) through processing functions and then to sinks (network, files, logs).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code structure is standard. No hidden backdoors or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed comprehensively, including all sections. No signs of malware such as data exfiltration, network to system commands, or malicious backdoors. Use of third-party libraries is typical. No suspicious data flows or anomalies noted.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard application code with no indicators of compromise.",
