{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a sample script that performs some data processing, possibly involving user input or external data sources, but the specific purpose is not explicitly clear from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'input()' function and possibly from external modules or files if imported (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing output to the console, executing functions with untrusted data, or writing to files or network connections (details not provided).",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input or external sources through processing functions to output or storage points, but specific paths cannot be fully determined without the complete code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious variable names detected. No obfuscated code, and no unusual language features are present. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input from the user, processes it through functions or operations, and then outputs results. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. Usage of standard libraries and functions suggests normal operation. Without additional context or external dependencies, no malicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to perform typical data processing tasks with no suspicious activity detected.",
