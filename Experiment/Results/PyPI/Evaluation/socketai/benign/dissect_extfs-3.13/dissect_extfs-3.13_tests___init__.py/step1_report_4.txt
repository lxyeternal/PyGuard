{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general utility, possibly involving data processing or network communication, but the specific purpose cannot be determined definitively from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input, or external files (not explicitly shown but implied). Possible network input or file reads are typical in such scripts.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations such as network requests, system commands, or file writes. Specific sinks are not explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables, user inputs, files) to sinks (network, file system, system commands) possibly through intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or obfuscated code are observed. The code structure is straightforward without unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, performing typical utility functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, hidden network communications, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious, and no insecure coding practices are evident. The absence of explicit data flows or suspicious logic suggests a benign purpose, although the limited snippet restricts comprehensive assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears safe and standard. However, due to limited context, this conclusion carries a moderate confidence level.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0,
