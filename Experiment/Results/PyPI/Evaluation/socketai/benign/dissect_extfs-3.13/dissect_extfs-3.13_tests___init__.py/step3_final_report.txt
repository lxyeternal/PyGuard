  "sources": "Not applicable; no code provided in the reports.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow analysis possible without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; reports indicate benign, straightforward code or absence of code.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly note the absence of code or suspicious patterns. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, reflecting no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. Risk scores are low (0.2), justified by the benign descriptions and lack of suspicious activity. Confidence levels are high (0.75 to 0.9), appropriate given the limited information. The assessments are internally consistent and align with the evidence provided.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious, with no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scoring system is justified and consistent across all reports. No adjustments are necessary given the current data.",
