  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a pytest-based unit test suite.\n- It imports custom exceptions from `dissect.extfs.exceptions`.\n- It parameterizes tests to verify that custom exceptions are subclasses of standard exceptions.\n- It raises these exceptions within the test, expecting them to be caught by `pytest.raises`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external input, data flow, or output.\n\n**Security & Malware Assessment:**\n- The code performs standard unit testing of exception class hierarchies.\n- There are no data leaks, untrusted data flows, or external communications.\n- No code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The tests do not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be malicious.\n- The custom exceptions are likely simple subclasses; nothing in the code indicates malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard practices.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — The code is a benign test suite with no security risks.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature; no issues detected.\n- The detailed reasoning confirms that the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, safe unit test verifying exception subclassing. No security risks or malicious activity are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard unit test for custom exception subclasses.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security issues are identified.\n- Scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at 0, confirming the code's safety and benign nature.",
