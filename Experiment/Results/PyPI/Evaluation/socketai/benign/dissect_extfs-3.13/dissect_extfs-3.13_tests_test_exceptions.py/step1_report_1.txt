  "purpose": "Unit testing for custom exception subclasses in the dissect.extfs.exceptions module.",
  "sources": "Import statements: __future__ import, pytest, and custom exceptions module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from source to sink; the test raises exceptions intentionally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and standard for unit tests.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a parameterized test function using pytest to verify that custom exception classes are subclasses of standard exceptions and behave correctly when raised. No input reading from external sources or untrusted data handling occurs. No code injections, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code strictly performs unit testing for exception class hierarchy correctness.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign unit test code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It confirms exception subclass relationships and correct behavior when raising exceptions. No malware or security threats are present.",
