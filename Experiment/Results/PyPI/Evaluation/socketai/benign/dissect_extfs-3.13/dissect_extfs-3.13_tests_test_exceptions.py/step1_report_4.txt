{
  "purpose": "Unit testing the inheritance and exception handling of custom exceptions in the 'dissect.extfs.exceptions' module.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code only imports and uses locally defined classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external inputs to sensitive sinks; the code only raises and checks exceptions internally.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for a test suite; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks and custom exceptions, then defines a parameterized test to verify the inheritance and behavior of custom exception classes. There are no external inputs, network operations, or data leaks involved. The code strictly performs assertions on class inheritance and exception raising, typical of a test module. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test script for exception class hierarchy verification. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security vulnerabilities.",
