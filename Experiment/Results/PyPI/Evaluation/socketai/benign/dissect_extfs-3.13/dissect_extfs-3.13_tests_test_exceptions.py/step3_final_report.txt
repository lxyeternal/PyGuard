{
  "purpose": "Verify that custom exceptions in dissect.extfs.exceptions are subclasses of standard exceptions and behave correctly when raised.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it raises exceptions directly within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The flow involves raising custom exceptions and verifying their subclass relationships; no external data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple pytest-based unit test verifying exception subclassing. It involves no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code performs standard inheritance checks and exception raising, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit test with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and overall security risk.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
