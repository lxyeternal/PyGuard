{
  "purpose": "This code is a test module for custom exception subclasses related to filesystem errors, verifying subclass relationships and correct raising behavior.",
  "sources": "The code imports from __future__, pytest, and a local exceptions module; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only raises and asserts exceptions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from parameterized test inputs through assertions and exception raising, with no data flowing from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code appears straightforward and typical for testing exception subclasses.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a parameterized test function to check that custom exceptions are subclasses of standard exceptions, and raises these exceptions within tests. It performs subclass verification and exception handling assertions. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code is a standard test suite for exception validation, with no external data handling or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test code validating exception subclass relationships and correct raising behavior. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
