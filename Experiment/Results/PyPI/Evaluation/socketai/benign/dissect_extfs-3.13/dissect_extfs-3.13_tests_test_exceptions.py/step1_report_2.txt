{
  "purpose": "This code defines a test suite using pytest to verify that custom exception classes in the dissect.extfs.exceptions module correctly subclass standard Python exceptions and behave as expected.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported modules (__future__, pytest, and dissect.extfs.exceptions), as well as the test parameters and assertions within the test function.",
  "sinks": "The code raises custom exception instances to be caught by pytest.raises, which is a controlled test environment, not an untrusted data sink or output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (exception classes) flow into assertions and the raise statement, which then triggers the pytest.raises context manager to catch exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code strictly performs standard testing operations without any suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features, testing frameworks, and custom exceptions. It parametrizes a test function to check the subclass relationship and instance type of custom exceptions against standard exceptions, then raises these exceptions within a pytest context. The flow is straightforward and involves no data outside the scope of testing, no dynamic code execution, or data manipulation. The code performs conventional unit testing of exception subclasses, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal test suite for verifying exception class inheritance and behavior. It does not contain malicious or suspicious elements, and its operations are safe and standard for testing purposes.",
