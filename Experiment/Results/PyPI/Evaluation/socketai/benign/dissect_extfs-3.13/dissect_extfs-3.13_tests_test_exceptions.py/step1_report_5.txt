{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for custom exception subclasses in the 'dissect.extfs.exceptions' module, ensuring they inherit from standard exception classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, pytest module, and 'dissect.extfs.exceptions' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Test functions verify class inheritance and exception raising; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a parameterized test to verify inheritance and behavior of custom exception classes. It uses pytest's features appropriately without executing external data or network operations. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The code solely performs in-memory assertions and exception handling checks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite verifying exception subclassing. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The code appears safe and typical for unit testing.",
