  "purpose": "Utility functions and fixtures for reading and decompressing gzip files, likely used for testing or data processing.",
  "sources": "Reading filename inputs for gzip file paths, accessing files via relative paths using __file__.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data leading to security impact are present; no network or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Filename inputs are used to locate and open gzip files, then data is yielded as binary streams for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Use of standard libraries and fixtures is typical for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions to resolve file paths relative to the script's location and to open gzip compressed files as binary streams. Fixtures provide access to specific compressed files, likely for testing purposes. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated elements, or malicious constructs. No external data leaks or malicious network activity are observed. The code appears to serve standard utility and testing functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility setup for handling gzip files in testing environments. No malicious or security-risk behavior is evident. It appears safe and purposeful.",
