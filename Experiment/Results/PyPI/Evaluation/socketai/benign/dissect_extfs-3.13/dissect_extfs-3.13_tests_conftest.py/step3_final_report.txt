  "purpose": "Utility functions for constructing absolute file paths and opening gzip-compressed binary files for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The function absolute_path reads the filename and constructs a Path object relative to the current file; gzip_file reads and yields gzip-compressed files specified by filename.",
  "sinks": "The code yields file handles from gzip files; no untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "absolute_path constructs the file path -> gzip_file opens the gzip file at that path -> yields the file handle for testing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for testing: constructing absolute paths and opening gzip files, yielding file handles. It uses standard libraries and pytest fixtures. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The code's purpose is limited to test setup, with no processing of untrusted data or network activity. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for reading gzip-compressed test data files. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
