      "conclusion": "The code is benign and consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. The primary concern is the redefinition of standard exceptions with the same names, which could be exploited maliciously if used improperly. Overall, the code is safe but should be reviewed if integrated into larger systems where such patterns could be exploited."
