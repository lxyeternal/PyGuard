{
  "purpose": "Re-export module for filesystem exceptions and classes from dissect.extfs package",
  "sources": "Static import statements from dissect.extfs.extfs, dissect.extfs.exceptions, dissect.extfs.journal",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static import statements and an __all__ declaration, serving as a module interface. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity. The code is typical for a module that re-exports classes and exceptions, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The import statements are explicit and straightforward, and the module does not process untrusted data or execute code. The absence of any suspicious patterns or behaviors indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module re-export with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals, including malware and obfuscation scores, are appropriately zero, and confidence is high. The code poses no threat and is consistent with a standard library pattern.",
