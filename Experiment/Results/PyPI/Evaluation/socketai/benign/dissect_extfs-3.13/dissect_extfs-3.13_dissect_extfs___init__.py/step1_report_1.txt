{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export specific classes and exceptions related to filesystem operations, likely for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'dissect.extfs' package, importing classes and exceptions related to filesystem handling.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks; the code does not process or execute untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs static imports and defines __all__ for module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is purely import and export declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements importing specific exceptions and classes from the 'dissect.extfs' package. It then defines the __all__ list to specify the module's public API. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could indicate malicious activity. The code appears to be part of a library or module setup, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It is a straightforward module import/export declaration, likely part of a filesystem handling library. The code is benign and poses no security threat.",
