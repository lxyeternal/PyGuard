{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a filesystem-related package, re-exporting specific classes and exceptions from submodules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements that read specific classes and exceptions from dissect.extfs submodules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no data flows from untrusted sources or involves untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and re-exports classes without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only handles module imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and exceptions from the dissect.extfs package, likely used for filesystem operations. It then defines __all__ to specify exported symbols for the module. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or obfuscation are present. The structure and content are typical for a Python module's __init__.py file or a re-export script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module re-export setup with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages namespace exports for filesystem-related classes and exceptions.",
