{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to normalize list indentation in markdown text, including parsing, formatting, and outputting normalized markdown.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters such as 'text' (input markdown content), configuration options from 'context.options', and internal regex matches during parsing.",
  "sinks": "Output is generated by joining formatted lines into a string; no direct untrusted sink is evident beyond output rendering.",
  "flows": "Input data ('text') is parsed into line structures, analyzed for indentation and syntax, then reformatted and joined into output; no external untrusted data flows to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are detected. Usage of regex and type annotations appears standard. No obfuscated code or malicious logic found.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard markdown list normalization through parsing lines, identifying list items, managing indentation levels, and outputting formatted markdown. It uses regex for list item detection, enum classes for syntax types, and structured data classes for managing line states. The functions focus on safe string handling, indentation calculation, and content reformatting. No dynamic code execution, network access, or system modification code is present. The logic is consistent with typical markdown processing routines, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate markdown list normalization utility without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle or transmit untrusted data beyond string processing, and there are no suspicious operations or backdoors present.",
