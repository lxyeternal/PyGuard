{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse and normalize markdown list indentation and structure, adjusting indent levels, and formatting list items accordingly.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily read from the parameter 'text' in the 'normalize_list' function; other sources include environment variables via 'get_conf' and configuration options from 'context.options'.",
  "sinks": "Data is output as a formatted string by the '_join' function, which concatenates processed lines into a markdown string. No untrusted data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' -> parse_line() -> acc_line_results() -> parse_text() -> _format_new_indent()/_format_new_content() -> _join() -> output string. No external network or system modifications occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code primarily processes markdown text and indentation levels. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs markdown list normalization through parsing, indent calculations, and list item formatting. It uses regex matching for list items and syntax detection. No evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration. It relies on local string processing and configuration inputs, with no external side effects or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate markdown list normalization utility with no malicious intent. It operates entirely within string processing, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
