{
  "purpose": "Postprocess inline tokens to fix word wrap issues in markdown list items by adding and removing a spacer string.",
  "sources": "get_conf() function to retrieve configuration, text parameter as input data, context.options for configuration, node.parent and node.parent.parent for structural data.",
  "sinks": "String manipulation and joins, especially in the wrapping logic; potential for string injection if text is manipulated improperly.",
  "flows": "Input text flows through conditional checks, string stripping, and conditional wrapping logic, ultimately leading to string joins and returns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Uses a control flag (context.do_wrap) to determine processing, but this is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard string processing, conditional wrapping, and indentation calculations to modify text for markdown list items. It relies on configuration values and structural node data. There are no external network calls, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The function is straightforward, focusing solely on text formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for formatting markdown inline text, with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It does not process or leak sensitive data, nor does it perform any unsafe operations.",
