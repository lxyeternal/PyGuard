{
  "purpose": "Postprocess inline tokens for proper word wrapping in markdown list items to improve formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration options via get_conf, input text (parameter 'text'), and context attributes; accesses module-level constants.",
  "sinks": "Returns processed text, potentially affecting how markdown is rendered; no direct data leakage or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "Input text flows through conditional checks, string manipulations, and wrapping logic, ultimately returning modified text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors identified. The function performs standard text processing with no network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and a function decorated with @rstrip_result. The function 'postprocess_list_wrap' adjusts list item formatting by adding and removing filler characters to control word wrapping. It relies on configuration parameters and the context object. The logic is consistent with markdown formatting needs, with no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or data exfiltration. No use of insecure functions or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard text processing function for markdown formatting, with no malicious behavior or security risks observed. It performs formatting adjustments to improve markdown rendering quality, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
