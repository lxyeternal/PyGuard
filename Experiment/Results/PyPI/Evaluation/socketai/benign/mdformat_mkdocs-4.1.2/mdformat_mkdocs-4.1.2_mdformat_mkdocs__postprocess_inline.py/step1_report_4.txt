No external resource access, file operations, or network communication is present.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code primarily performs text processing for markdown rendering, involving indentation-aware line wrapping. It checks configuration options, traverses the node tree, and conditionally wraps text. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are evident. The only unusual aspect is the use of the soft break character, which is a common technique for in-memory string manipulation. The code is straightforward and focused on formatting logic. No suspicious external interactions or sensitive data handling are identified.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code appears to be a standard markdown postprocessing utility aimed at correct line wrapping within list contexts. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.\",\n  \"confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0\n}",
