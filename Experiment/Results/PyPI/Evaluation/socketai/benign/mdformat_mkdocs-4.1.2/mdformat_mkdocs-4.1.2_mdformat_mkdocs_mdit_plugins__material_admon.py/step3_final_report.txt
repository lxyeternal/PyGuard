  "purpose": "Parsing and formatting MkDocs Material admonitions in Markdown, recognizing specific markers and metadata to generate tokens for rendering admonition blocks, including optional titles and collapsible sections.",
  "sources": "Input from markdown parser state, including admonition metadata and markers.",
  "sinks": "Creates tokens for rendering admonitions, titles, and collapsible sections.",
  "flows": "Markdown input → parsing functions → token creation and formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code; relies on external functions whose implementations are not provided but are assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parsing and token creation for admonition blocks, with no network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. It uses external utilities for token management, which are typical in markdown-it plugins. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident within this snippet. The reliance on external functions introduces minimal risk, but within the provided code, no malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard markdown extension for MkDocs admonitions, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate; the slight increase in risk score (0.2) reflects dependency on external functions, but overall, the code is safe.",
