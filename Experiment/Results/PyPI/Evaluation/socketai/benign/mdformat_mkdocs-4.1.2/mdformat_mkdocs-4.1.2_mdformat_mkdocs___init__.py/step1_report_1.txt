  "purpose": "Define metadata and import certain functions and variables for an mdformat plugin used within mkdocs.",
  "sources": "Module attributes (__version__, __plugin_name__) and the import statement importing from .plugin",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or cause data leaks; import statements are standard and safe",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; module attributes are static, import does not involve untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module-level variables (__version__, __plugin_name__) and imports specific components from a local plugin module. The import path is relative, which is typical in package modules. There are no dynamic evaluations, no hardcoded credentials, or external network calls. All elements are static and standard for plugin initialization. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward plugin metadata and import module with no malicious or suspicious features. It appears to be safe and intended for plugin registration within the mkdocs ecosystem.",
