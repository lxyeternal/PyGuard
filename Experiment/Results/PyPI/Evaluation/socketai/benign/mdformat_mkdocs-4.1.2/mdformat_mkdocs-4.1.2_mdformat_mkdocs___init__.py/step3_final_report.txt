  "purpose": "Define plugin metadata (__version__, __plugin_name__) and import plugin components from a local module for mkdocs/mdformat integration.",
  "sources": "Module-level variable assignments and relative import from .plugin",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and variable definitions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static code execution only",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module setting plugin metadata and importing functions/variables from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation. The import path is relative, typical for plugin modules. No external data handling or dynamic execution is present. The code's simplicity and purpose as a plugin setup indicate a benign intent. All signals point to safe, standard plugin configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended for plugin registration. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
