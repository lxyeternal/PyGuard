  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily setting metadata (__version__, __plugin_name__) and importing functions/variables from a local module (.plugin).\n- There are no indications of dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The code appears to be standard for plugin initialization and registration within the mkdocs/mdformat ecosystem.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or anomalies are detected across all reports.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 in the first report, and 0 in others. Given the code's simplicity and lack of any security-sensitive operations, a risk score of 0.1 seems slightly conservative but acceptable. Since the code does not perform any risky operations, a score of 0 would also be reasonable.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious or suspicious features.\n- The import from a relative module (.plugin) is standard in package code; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.\n- The comments and structure suggest this is a plugin setup file, not an execution or data processing component.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe, benign, and standard for plugin registration.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (since the code is purely static and non-sensitive)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate; the code poses no security threat.",
