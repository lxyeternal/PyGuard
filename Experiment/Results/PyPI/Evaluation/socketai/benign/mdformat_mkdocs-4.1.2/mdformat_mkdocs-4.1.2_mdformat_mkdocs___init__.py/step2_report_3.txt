  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, consisting of module-level variables (__version__, __plugin_name__) and import statements from a local module (.plugin).\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The import path is relative, which is typical in package modules, and no signs of malicious code are evident.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: defining plugin metadata and importing plugin components.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0 in all cases, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk score is very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n- The confidence level is high (1) in all reports, consistent with the clear, static code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent; no anomalies or suspicious claims are made.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate and reasonable based on the code content.\n- No report suggests any assumptions that could be challenged or require further scrutiny.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0.\n- The risk score could be slightly increased from 0.1 to, say, 0.2, to reflect the minimal but non-zero potential for misconfiguration, but given the static nature, 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal risk, mostly due to being a plugin setup code; still very low)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, static, and standard for plugin initialization.\n- No malicious or suspicious features are present.\n- Scores are appropriate; I would keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and risk at 0.1.",
