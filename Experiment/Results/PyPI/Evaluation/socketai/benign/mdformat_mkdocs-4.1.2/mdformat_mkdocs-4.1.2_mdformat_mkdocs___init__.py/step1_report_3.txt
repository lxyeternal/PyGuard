{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata and import statements for an mdformat plugin used with mkdocs.",
  "sources": "Constants (__version__, __plugin_name__), import from local plugin module",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; mostly metadata and imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code only sets plugin metadata variables and imports functions/objects from a local module. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The import statement references a local file, which is typical for plugin modules. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward plugin metadata and import setup with no malicious intent or security risks.",
