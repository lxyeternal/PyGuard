  "purpose": "Define plugin metadata and import plugin components for an mkdocs mdformat plugin.",
  "sources": "None (no input or external data reads besides module imports).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected).",
  "flows": "Not applicable (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; standard module metadata, versioning, and import statements with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of defining module metadata (__version__, __plugin_name__) and importing specific components from a local plugin module. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, or suspicious network or file operations. The comments reference source code for plugin interfaces. The import statement only imports predefined components, and no untrusted input handling is present. Overall, the code appears straightforward and typical for a plugin setup, with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard plugin module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets metadata and imports plugin components. No malicious intent detected.",
