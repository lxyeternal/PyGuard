  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific computational or data processing task, but without seeing the actual code, this cannot be confirmed.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files, which are typical sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or data writing functions that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks, potentially passing through transformation or validation steps; without the code, exact paths cannot be determined.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors can be identified without the code content.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information provided to perform detailed analysis. No code snippet or content was included to evaluate source, sink, flow, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine malicious behavior or security risks without code content. No evidence of malware or security issues detected due to lack of data.",
