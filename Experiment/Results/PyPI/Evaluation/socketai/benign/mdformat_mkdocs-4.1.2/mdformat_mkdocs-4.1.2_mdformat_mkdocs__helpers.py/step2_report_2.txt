  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is a set of utility functions: a decorator (`rstrip_result`), a string parser (`separate_indent`), and a configuration getter (`get_conf`).\n- All functions operate on input parameters or constants, with no external data fetching, no dynamic code execution, and no I/O operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious behavior are evident.\n- The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and safe.\n\n**2. Logical, Reasoning, or Summary Flaws in the Reports:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no security issues or malware.\n- They correctly identify that the functions are utility helpers with no malicious intent.\n- No flaws or inaccuracies are evident in their reasoning.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0.0, obfuscated scores of 0.0, and security risk scores of 0.0 or very close to zero.\n- These scores seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n- The last report assigns a security risk of 0.1, which is slightly higher but still very low, reflecting minimal concern—probably due to the regex or configuration handling, but still safe.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports or the code justifies a risk score above 0.5.\n- The highest risk score is 0.1, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**\n- No signs of malicious code, dynamic execution, or external data handling.\n- Malware score of 0.0 across all reports is justified.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports base their conclusions on the code's straightforward utility functions.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made; their assessments are reasonable.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's benign and utility-oriented nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Critical Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** **0.0**  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** **0.0**  \n**Estimated Security Risk Score:** **0.0–0.1** (very low, due to regex, but not concerning)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is standard utility functions with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No further action needed; the supply chain risk here is negligible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The overall risk and malware scores should remain at 0.0, with a very minimal security risk score (around 0.1) if any.",
