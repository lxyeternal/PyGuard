  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward utility functions: a decorator to strip whitespace, a regex-based indent separator, and a configuration retrieval function.\n- No report indicates any suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The constants and functions are standard, with no signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The only minor point is in report 5, which assigns a securityRisk score of 0.1, but even there, the reasoning is that the code \"processes configuration options\" and \"string manipulations\" with no evident risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports confirm the code is benign, with no security issues or malware.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign utility functions.\n- The only minor inconsistency is in report 5, which assigns a small securityRisk score (0.1). Given the code's nature, this is probably an overestimation, but it's a conservative stance.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0.0, except report 5, which assigns 0.1. Given the benign nature, I agree with 0.0; the small 0.1 seems unnecessary.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, and I concur that the code is safe.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** — no security risk present.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard set of utility functions with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in report 5 is an overestimate; I recommend setting it to 0.0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Score Type      | Final Recommended Score |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0.0                     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.0                     |\n| Security Risk   | 0.0                     |\n\n**This aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across reports.**",
