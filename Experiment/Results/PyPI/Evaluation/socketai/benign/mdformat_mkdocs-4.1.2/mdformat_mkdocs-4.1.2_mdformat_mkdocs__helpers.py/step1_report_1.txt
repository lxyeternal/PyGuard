  "purpose": "Provide general helper functions for string manipulation, configuration retrieval, and formatting used in a larger markdown processing context.",
  "sources": "None; all functions operate on input parameters or module-level constants.",
  "sinks": "None; functions return processed data or configuration values without writing or executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions and constants: a decorator to strip whitespace from function outputs, a regex-based function to separate indentation from content, and a configuration retrieval function that accesses nested configuration options. All operations are straightforward and do not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to security issues. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The use of assertions is safe here as they serve as sanity checks. No suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely manipulates strings and retrieves configuration values, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
