  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and constants for text processing and configuration handling within a plugin system.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from options['mdformat'] and related nested dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No significant sinks where untrusted data causes security issues are present. No output or data transmission functions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration options into internal functions, with no user input or external data sources being directly processed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code appears to be standard utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, decorators, and functions for string processing and configuration retrieval. The rstrip_result decorator is a standard pattern to modify function output. separate_indent uses regex to parse indentation, which is safe here. get_conf retrieves configuration values from nested dictionaries, with no user input handling or external data fetching. All functions appear straightforward and free of malicious logic or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions for string manipulation and configuration management, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malware. It appears safe and standard in context.",
