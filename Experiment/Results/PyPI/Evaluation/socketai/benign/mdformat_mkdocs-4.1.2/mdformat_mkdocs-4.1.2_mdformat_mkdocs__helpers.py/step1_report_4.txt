  "purpose": "Provides helper functions and constants for text processing and configuration retrieval in a markdown formatting plugin.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (__future__, re, collections.abc, functools, typing), local module (__plugin_name__).",
  "sinks": "None observed. The code does not perform any I/O, network operations, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code reads configuration options from a nested dictionary and applies simple string manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and utility functions: rstrip_result (decorator for stripping output), separate_indent (regex for extracting indentation and content), get_conf (fetch configuration value from nested dictionaries). All functions perform straightforward operations with no evidence of malicious intent. There are no network calls, no dynamic execution, and no handling of sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard helper functions for a markdown formatting plugin. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
