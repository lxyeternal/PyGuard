{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and constants for text processing and configuration management in a plugin system.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration options via get_conf, and processes input data such as lines of text.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data identified; functions mainly process strings and configuration dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Configuration options are retrieved from input options, but no data flows into insecure sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. Usage of regex for indent detection appears straightforward. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions and constants with standard usage. get_conf reads configuration options with fallback paths, which is typical. The rstrip_result decorator and separate_indent function perform safe string manipulations. No external network, file, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears clean, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of helper functions and constants for text processing and configuration access. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks detected.",
