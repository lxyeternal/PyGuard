  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code consists of straightforward utility functions: string manipulation, configuration retrieval, and constants.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are identified.\n- The functions operate on input parameters or module constants, with no external or untrusted data processing that could lead to security issues.\n- No evidence of malware, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or malicious behaviors.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1.0), and the obfuscated/malware scores are zero or very close to zero.\n- The only slight concern is a security risk score of 0.1 in report 5, which seems to be an overestimation given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Confirming Issues in the Code:**\n- The code appears clean and free from security issues.\n- The only minor point is the use of `assert match` in `separate_indent`. While assertions are generally safe, in production code they can be disabled, potentially leading to silent failures if the regex does not match. However, this does not introduce security risks; it's more about robustness.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws are evident.\n- The assessments of benign behavior are correct.\n- The slight overestimation of security risk in report 5 (0.1) does not reflect actual risk, but it's a minor point.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, indicating no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0.0 or very close to it is justified. Report 5's 0.1 might be marginally high; a 0.0 would be more accurate.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made; all functions are straightforward.\n- No hidden malicious logic or obfuscation is present.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is standard utility code with no security issues.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The overall security risk score should be 0, possibly 0.0, reflecting no risk.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
