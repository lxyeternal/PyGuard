{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for string manipulation, configuration retrieval, and formatting helpers in a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from the 'options' dictionary, and input data from function arguments such as 'line' and 'func' parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other security issues.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from the 'options' parameter to the 'get_conf' function, and input strings flow through 'separate_indent' and 'rstrip_result' functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward utility functions with no external or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions with no dynamic execution or external data injections. The regex used in 'separate_indent' appears standard for indent parsing. 'get_conf' retrieves configuration values safely from nested dictionaries. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of utility functions for formatting and configuration management. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified.",
