  "purpose": "Utility functions for string manipulation, indentation parsing, and configuration retrieval in a markdown formatting context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions, constants defined at module level (e.g., line strings, regex patterns).",
  "sinks": "None; functions operate on local data and do not process untrusted input or produce side effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through functions without external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assert statement in 'separate_indent' could be disabled, but this does not pose security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward utility functions: a decorator to strip trailing whitespace, a regex-based parser for indentation, and a configuration getter from nested dictionaries. No external data fetching, dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive operations are present. The regex is standard, and constants are benign. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0.0. The only minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report appears overestimated given the code's simplicity. Overall, the code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score should be 0, the obfuscated score should be 0, and the security risk score should be 0. The minor risk score of 0.1 is an overestimate and should be revised to 0 for consistency.",
