  "purpose": "Re-exporting functions and classes from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions and classes from a local module '_whitespace_admon_factories'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted input or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import is static and not influenced by external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no unusual code constructs or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific symbols from a local module and exposes them via __all__ for external modules to use. It is a standard pattern for creating a public API surface for a package. No dynamic code execution, input processing, or network operations are present. The module's purpose is solely to re-export symbols, and it does not include any malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, safe re-export module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
