{
  "purpose": "This code re-exports functions and classes from a local module '_whitespace_admon_factories' for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from ._whitespace_admon_factories import (...)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data effects observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; simple import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific names from a relative module '_whitespace_admon_factories' and defines an __all__ list for export. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, network communication, or other potentially risky operations. The code appears to be a clean re-export pattern, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions solely as an export interface. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
