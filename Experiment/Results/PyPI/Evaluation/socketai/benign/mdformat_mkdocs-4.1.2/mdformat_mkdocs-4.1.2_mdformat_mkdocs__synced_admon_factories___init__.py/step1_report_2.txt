{
  "purpose": "This code re-exports certain functions and classes from a local module '_whitespace_admon_factories' for external use, likely as part of a larger package or library.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from ._whitespace_admon_factories import ...' which reads the module '_whitespace_admon_factories'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling beyond module import and __all__ declaration.",
  "flows": "The source (import) brings in functions and classes from a local module, which are then made available for external modules via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution. The code is a straightforward module re-export.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from a relative module and defines the __all__ list for explicit exports. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external network interactions. No suspicious behaviors such as data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code is minimal, standard, and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple re-export of functions and classes from a local module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
