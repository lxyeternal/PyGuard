  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific classes and functions from a local module '_whitespace_admon_factories' and re-exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module '_whitespace_admon_factories'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple re-export module that imports specific symbols from a local module and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's nature. The trustworthiness of the imported module is assumed but not verified; however, this does not impact the benign assessment of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for exposing an API surface with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
