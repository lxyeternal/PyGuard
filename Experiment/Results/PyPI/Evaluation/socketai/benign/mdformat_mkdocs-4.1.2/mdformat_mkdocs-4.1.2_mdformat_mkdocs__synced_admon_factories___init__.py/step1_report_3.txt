  "purpose": "The code re-exports specific classes and functions from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module ._whitespace_admon_factories",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurring in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static import and export statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and typical for module exports",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from a local module and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. There are no data inputs, external communications, or dynamic code execution. The structure indicates typical module re-exporting without any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export pattern with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply re-exports components from a local module.",
