  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear without detailed context.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, possibly user input, or file reads (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes output to console, files, or network connections if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like output statements or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. No apparent malicious code such as network transmissions, system modifications, or data theft observed.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows standard Python functions with no evident malicious patterns. The code does not include suspicious imports, dynamic execution, or obfuscated parts. The structure and flow appear typical for utility scripts or application logic. Without specific functions that handle sensitive data or perform risky operations, there are no obvious security concerns. The absence of external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms reduces the likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
