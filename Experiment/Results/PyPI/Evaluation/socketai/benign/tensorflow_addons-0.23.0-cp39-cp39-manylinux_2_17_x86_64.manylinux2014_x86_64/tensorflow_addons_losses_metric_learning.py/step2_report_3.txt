  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as implementing standard functions for computing pairwise Euclidean and angular distances using TensorFlow.\n- They consistently note the use of numerical stability techniques, proper tensor operations, and no external data flows or network activity.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign very low or zero scores for malware and security risk, with high confidence levels.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Code's Behavior:\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of metric learning utilities, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The functions perform well-understood mathematical operations: pairwise Euclidean distances and cosine-based angular distances.\n- Numerical stability measures (adding epsilon, masking diagonals) are standard practices.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are apparent.\n- The code appears correct and well-documented.\n- No signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports give malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence scores are high, reflecting the thoroughness of the reviews.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are detected, risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- The functions are utility functions for metric calculation, commonly used in ML pipelines, and do not process untrusted data or perform network operations.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- Both are 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the detailed reviews, the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code with no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a legitimate, well-implemented utility for metric learning, with no supply chain security concerns. The high confidence scores and consistent findings across reports support this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malware.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The overall risk remains negligible.\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or a different focus is required.",
