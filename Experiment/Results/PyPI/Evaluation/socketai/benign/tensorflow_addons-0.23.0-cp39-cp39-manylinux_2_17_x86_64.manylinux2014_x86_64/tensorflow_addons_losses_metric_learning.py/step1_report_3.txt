{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for metric learning, specifically for computing pairwise Euclidean and angular distances between feature vectors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'feature' parameter, which are tensors representing feature vectors.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical computations and returns distance matrices; no direct data leakage or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Input feature tensors are processed through normalization and distance calculations, resulting in output distance matrices. There are no data flows to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code uses standard TensorFlow functions and adheres to typical metric computation practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'pairwise_distance' computes Euclidean distances with numerical stability handling, and 'angular_distance' computes cosine-based angular distances. Both functions normalize and process input tensors in a standard manner. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or system modifications. It appears to be a standard implementation of metric calculations, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of metric learning functions using TensorFlow. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and suitable for use in machine learning applications.",
