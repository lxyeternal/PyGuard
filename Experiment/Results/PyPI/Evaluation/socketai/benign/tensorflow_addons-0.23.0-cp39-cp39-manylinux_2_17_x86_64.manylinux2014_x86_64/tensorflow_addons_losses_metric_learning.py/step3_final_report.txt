  "purpose": "Functions for metric learning: computing pairwise Euclidean and angular distances between feature vectors.",
  "sources": "Input tensors 'feature' for both functions, read via tf operations.",
  "sinks": "Internal tensor computations; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are normalized or squared, then used in tf.matmul and tf.math operations to produce distance matrices.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code uses standard practices for numerical stability and tensor operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard metric learning functions with proper numerical stability measures, no suspicious logic, no external data flows, and no obfuscation. It performs straightforward mathematical operations for distance calculations, consistent with common ML utility functions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The code is well-documented and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a typical utility for metric calculations in machine learning pipelines, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage.",
