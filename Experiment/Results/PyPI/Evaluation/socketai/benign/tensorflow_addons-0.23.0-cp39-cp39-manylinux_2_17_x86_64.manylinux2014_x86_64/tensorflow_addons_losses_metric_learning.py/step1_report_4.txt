{
  "purpose": "The code implements metric learning functions, specifically pairwise distance and angular distance calculations, for use in machine learning models.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the 'feature' parameter in both functions, which are tensors representing data features.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include outputs of the functions where distances are computed, but no external data or untrusted sources are directly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors ('feature') through normalization and distance calculations, resulting in distance matrices; no external transmission or untrusted data usage is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code uses standard mathematical operations for distance calculations. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious functions, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions, 'pairwise_distance' and 'angular_distance', both performing standard calculations for distance matrices used in metric learning. The implementation includes numerical stability adjustments, such as handling negative values and zero diagonals. No external inputs beyond the provided tensors are used, and no outputs suggest malicious behavior or data exfiltration. The code relies solely on TensorFlow's functions for computations. No signs of backdoors, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of distance metric functions for machine learning purposes. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of common mathematical operations.",
