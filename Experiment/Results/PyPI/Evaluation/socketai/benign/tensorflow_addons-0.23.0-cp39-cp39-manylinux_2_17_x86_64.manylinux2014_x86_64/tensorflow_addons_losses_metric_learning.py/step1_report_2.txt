{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute pairwise Euclidean and angular distances for feature vectors, typically used in metric learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input tensor 'feature' in both functions, which are used as data for distance calculations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks; computations are confined within the functions.",
  "flows": "Input 'feature' is normalized or squared, then used in matrix operations to produce distance matrices. No external data flow or network activity is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard distance calculations with numerical stability adjustments. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two functions: 'pairwise_distance' for Euclidean distances and 'angular_distance' for cosine-based distances. Both functions perform standard, well-understood operations with safeguards against numerical inaccuracies, such as adding epsilon in square root calculations and masking diagonal entries. The code uses TensorFlow functions appropriately, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious data handling. No external or untrusted data sources, no suspicious logic, and no network activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of distance metrics used in machine learning, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be benign, standard utility functions with proper numerical stability considerations.",
