  "purpose": "The code defines functions for metric learning, specifically calculating pairwise Euclidean distances and angular distances between feature vectors, likely for use in machine learning models such as neural networks.",
  "sources": "TensorFlow library functions, input feature tensors provided as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical operations on input tensors; no external data sinks or network transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Input feature tensors are normalized or squared, then used in mathematical operations to produce distance matrices. No external or untrusted data flows or outputs are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code employs standard tensor operations for metric calculations, with numerical stability measures. No hidden backdoors or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard TensorFlow functions to compute pairwise Euclidean and angular distances between feature vectors. It includes measures for numerical stability, such as clamping small negative values to zero and adding epsilon to avoid sqrt of zero. The functions are well-documented, and no suspicious operations, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications, are present. The code appears legitimate for machine learning purposes with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code performs standard metric computations using TensorFlow, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It is typical of a utility module in machine learning pipelines and shows no evidence of malware or security risks.",
