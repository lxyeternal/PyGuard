  "purpose": "Implementations of pairwise and angular distance computations for tensor data, typically used in metric learning and neural network training.",
  "sources": "Input tensors 'feature' provided as arguments to functions, which are expected to be data tensors used in machine learning models.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that leak untrusted data or perform harmful actions; functions return computed distance matrices without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are normalized and processed to produce distance matrices; no external data or network interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of numerical stability techniques is standard for such calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for calculating pairwise distances: Euclidean and angular. Both functions perform tensor operations, normalization, and mathematical computations in a standard manner for metric learning tasks. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code utilizes TensorFlow operations for numerical stability and correctness. No external data or network activity is present. The purpose appears solely to compute distances between data points in a model training context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured tensor distance computations for metric learning. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is part of a typical machine learning utility library, with no suspicious or harmful intent.",
