  "purpose": "Define TensorFlow Addons version information including version constraints and current version details.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments and version variables",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data output points identified",
  "flows": "Version variables are concatenated to form the __version__ string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures; standard versioning code",
  "analysis": "The code sets minimum and maximum TensorFlow version bounds, and defines version variables following semantic versioning. The __version__ string is constructed from these variables. No user input, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version information module for TensorFlow Addons. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and follows standard practices. No security risks identified.",
