  "purpose": "Define version information for TensorFlow Addons, including version constraints and current version metadata.",
  "sources": "Constants defining version constraints and metadata, including version number components.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data inputs or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and only involves static variable definitions and string concatenation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version-related constants and constructs a version string. It does not process input, execute external commands, or include dynamic code execution. The structure is simple, and all variables are static. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic. The license header and comments are standard for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining version metadata for TensorFlow Addons. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. It is a straightforward, standard version information module.",
