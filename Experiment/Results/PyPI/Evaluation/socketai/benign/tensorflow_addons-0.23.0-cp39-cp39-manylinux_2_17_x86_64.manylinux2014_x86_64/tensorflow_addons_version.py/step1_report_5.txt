  "purpose": "Define version information for TensorFlow Addons, including version constraints and current versioning details.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments, version number variables, and license comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version variables and concatenation for __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static version information variables, comments, and license headers. It does not process external input, execute dynamic code, or interact with untrusted sources. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to be a straightforward version definition file for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version info module for TensorFlow Addons with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe and normal for package versioning purposes.",
