  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, straightforward version information module.\n   - There are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, or outputs.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The code is purely for defining version constraints and current version info, following standard practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, no adjustments are necessary.\n   - The code poses no security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n   - No malicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores align with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a standard, static version definition module with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriately zero.\n- No further action or score adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is a benign, standard version info module with no security concerns. The existing scores are appropriate, and no changes are needed.",
