  "purpose": "Define TensorFlow Addons version information including version constraints and current version string.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments for version numbers and comments; no external data or input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard version definitions and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining version constraints and current version string for TensorFlow Addons. It involves only constant string assignments, concatenation, and comments. No dynamic execution, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code follows standard practices and contains no suspicious or malicious elements. All signals indicate benign, static code with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version information module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
