  "purpose": "Define TensorFlow Addons version information including version constraints and current version details.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings, license comments, and license URL.",
  "sinks": "None present; code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration values only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; comments and version definitions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static constants and comments setting version ranges, release candidates, and version strings. No external data is read or written, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious or obfuscated code. The license comments and version management are typical for open-source projects. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version information module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign part of the TensorFlow Addons package.",
