  "purpose": "Define version information for TensorFlow Addons package, including version constraints and current versioning details.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and comments; version string assembly.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or input sources are present.",
  "flows": "Assembly of version string from constants; no external data flow or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward version definition and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines versioning variables and comments regarding licensing and version constraints. There are no inputs, external data sources, or executable code that could be exploited. The version string is constructed from static constants, with no dynamic execution or external influence. The license and comments are standard for open-source projects. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign version definition snippet with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
