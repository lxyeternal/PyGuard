  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is static, involves only constant string assignments, version variables, and comments.\n   - No dynamic execution, input/output processing, or external data handling is present.\n   - The code is standard for version management in open-source projects.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Anomalies**:\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures.\n   - No backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution are detected.\n   - The license headers and comments are typical and do not indicate any malicious intent.\n\n3. **Security Risks**:\n   - Given the static nature and standard practice, the code poses no security risks.\n   - The absence of data sinks, external inputs, or executable code supports this conclusion.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n   - Confidence is high (1), as the analysis is thorough and consistent across reports.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies**:\n   - No issues are present in the code or in the reasoning.\n   - The reports are aligned and reasonable.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimates** align with the reports:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign version information module with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the code content and analysis.",
