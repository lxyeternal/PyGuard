  "conclusion": "The script is a standard utility for loading custom TensorFlow shared libraries, with no malicious code within. The primary security concern is the potential execution of malicious code if the shared objects are compromised or malicious. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The security risk score should be low but reflects the importance of verifying the integrity of external shared libraries. Overall, the code itself is benign; security risks depend on external file trustworthiness."
