  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a standard library initialization with no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified. The report correctly notes the internal functions are used for warnings and version checks, which are typical.\n- **Scores?** The malware and security risk scores are 0, which seems appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?** Not applicable; the code appears benign.\n- **Obfuscated/malicious?** No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.\n- **Assumptions?** The report does not rely on assumptions; it correctly interprets the code.\n- **Consistency of scores?** Yes.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with a slightly lower confidence. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores?** Zero malware, security risk; appropriate.\n- **Use of internal functions?** Noted but not suspicious.\n- **Conclusion?** Correctly identifies the code as standard setup code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar findings; standard imports and version checks.\n- **Scores?** Zero malware/security risk.\n- **Use of internal functions?** Noted but not problematic.\n- **Conclusion?** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern; straightforward utility setup.\n- **Scores?** Zero malware/security risk.\n- **Analysis?** Correctly identifies benign nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous reports; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores?** Zero malware/security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** Given the benign nature, malware and security risk scores should be **0** across all reports.\n- **Malware score justification:** The code does not perform any malicious actions, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated code:** None present.\n- **Assumptions:** The reports do not rely on unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Your own estimate:**\n  - **Malware score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n  - **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python library, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
