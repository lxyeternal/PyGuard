{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and imports for TensorFlow Addons, a library of extra functionalities for TensorFlow.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow_addons modules, calls to _print_eol_warning() and _check_tf_version() functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly sends data over the network, writes to files, or executes untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The functions _print_eol_warning() and _check_tf_version() are called; they may display warnings or check versions but do not involve data leaks or malicious actions. Imports are static and do not involve data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal functions prefixed with underscores (_check_tf_version, _print_eol_warning) suggests reliance on internal or non-public APIs, which could be unstable but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of licensing information, import statements, and calls to internal utility functions to display warnings and verify TensorFlow version compatibility. No data input/output, network activity, or execution of untrusted code is present. Usage of internal functions is noted but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be standard library setup code with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a TensorFlow Addons package, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The use of internal functions is a concern for stability but not security. No malicious behavior detected.",
