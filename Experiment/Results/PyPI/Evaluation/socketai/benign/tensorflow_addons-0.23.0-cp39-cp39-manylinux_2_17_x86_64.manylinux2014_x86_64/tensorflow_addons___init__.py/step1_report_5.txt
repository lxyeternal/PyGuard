{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and imports related to TensorFlow Addons, mainly for version checks, warnings, and importing modules for extended functionality.",
  "sources": "External imports such as 'tensorflow_addons.utils.ensure_tf_install', 'tensorflow_addons.utils.tfa_eol_msg', and various modules within 'tensorflow_addons'. These are used to perform version checks, display warnings, and import functionalities.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data can lead to data leaks or security effects. No execution of untrusted input, network operations, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling functions (_print_eol_warning() and _check_tf_version()) which are internal utility functions, then importing multiple modules from tensorflow_addons. There are no data flows from external untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The functions called (_print_eol_warning, _check_tf_version) are likely internal utility functions performing standard checks and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard imports and utility function calls for version checking and warning display related to TensorFlow Addons. No user input processing, network communication, or data handling is present. All functions invoked are for utility purposes. The import statements are straightforward. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with license and copyright notices, and standard utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, mainly performing version checks, warnings, and module imports for a TensorFlow Addons package. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
