  "purpose": "Initialize TensorFlow Addons by importing modules, displaying end-of-life warnings, and checking TensorFlow version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Calls to internal functions `_print_eol_warning()` and `_check_tf_version()` for warnings and version validation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Internal functions are invoked for warnings and version checks; no external data flow or malicious activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal (underscore-prefixed) functions, which are typical for internal utility calls, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python library, importing modules and calling internal functions for warnings and version validation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present. The internal functions are used as intended for environment checks. No external data handling or network activity is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign initialization script for TensorFlow Addons, performing environment checks and warnings without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are justified and appropriate.",
