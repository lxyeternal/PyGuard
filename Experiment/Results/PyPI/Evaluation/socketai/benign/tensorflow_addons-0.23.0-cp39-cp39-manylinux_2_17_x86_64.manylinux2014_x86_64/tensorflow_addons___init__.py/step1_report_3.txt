{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and imports related to TensorFlow Addons, a library of supplementary components for TensorFlow.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow_addons.utils, tensorflow_addons, and tensorflow_addons.register modules, as well as calls to functions _print_eol_warning() and _check_tf_version()",
  "sinks": "Function calls _print_eol_warning() and _check_tf_version() could potentially handle or display information, but their implementation is not shown here",
  "flows": "The functions _print_eol_warning() and _check_tf_version() are invoked immediately; no untrusted input handling or data flow present in the visible code",
  "anomalies": "Use of private/internal functions (_print_eol_warning, _check_tf_version) that might have side effects; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code evident; standard import patterns",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules and functions from tensorflow_addons, calls two internal functions likely for version checking and warnings. The use of internal functions is typical for internal checks or warnings. No external data inputs, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious operations are visible. The code appears to serve as a setup or initialization script with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for TensorFlow Addons, performing version checks and warnings. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are evident. It is safe and typical for its purpose.",
