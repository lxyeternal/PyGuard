{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and imports for TensorFlow Addons, a library that extends TensorFlow's functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from 'tensorflow_addons.utils.ensure_tf_install' and 'tensorflow_addons.utils.tfa_eol_msg', and imports multiple modules from 'tensorflow_addons'. It also calls two functions: _print_eol_warning() and _check_tf_version().",
  "sinks": "Calls to _print_eol_warning() and _check_tf_version() may output warnings or messages, but these are informational and not malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data sources are not present; the code primarily performs initializations and function calls that produce logs or warnings.",
  "anomalies": "The functions _print_eol_warning() and _check_tf_version() are internal (prefixed with underscores), which may indicate they are meant for internal use, but their presence alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility functions and modules from tensorflow_addons, then calls functions intended to print warnings and verify the TensorFlow version. These are standard procedures for ensuring environment compatibility. No untrusted data input, network communication, or malicious code is present. The code appears to be a normal library initialization script with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup file for TensorFlow Addons, mainly importing modules and executing initial checks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
