  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is standard, importing modules and calling functions that display warnings and check versions.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The functions `_print_eol_warning()` and `_check_tf_version()` are internal, but their use here is typical for environment validation.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk are both 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no suspicious behavior, and no obfuscation. The internal functions are for warnings and version checks, common in setup scripts.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and reasonable scoring.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same reasoning as above.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. Use of internal functions is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Justification:** No data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior. Internal functions are used for warnings.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to previous reports.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. Use of internal functions is typical for internal checks.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk are 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. Use of private functions does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no external data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same pattern.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, all are at 0 or very low, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendation:\nBased on the provided code and reports, **the scores are consistent and justified**. The code is a typical setup script for a library, performing environment checks and module imports without any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and poses no security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable.",
