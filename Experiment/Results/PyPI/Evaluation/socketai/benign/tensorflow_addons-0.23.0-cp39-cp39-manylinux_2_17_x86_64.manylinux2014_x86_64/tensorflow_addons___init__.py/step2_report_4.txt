  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard imports and calls to internal functions `_print_eol_warning()` and `_check_tf_version()`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious activity; just output warnings and version checks.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of internal functions (`_` prefix) is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is typical for initializing a library, with no malicious behavior. The functions are for warnings and version validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (since it's internal functions, but no security concern).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on internal functions and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: imports, internal function calls for warnings/version checks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: standard setup code, internal functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, standard imports, internal utility functions, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** All reports are consistent with standard library initialization scripts.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0.5 seems somewhat high for such benign code. A more appropriate risk score would be **0.1 or 0.2**, reflecting minimal security concern but acknowledging internal function use.\n\n### Malware score justification:\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code.\n- Use of internal functions (`_print_eol_warning`, `_check_tf_version`) is typical for library internal checks, not malicious.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, standard library setup with internal function calls)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard initialization script for TensorFlow Addons.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- The current risk score of 0.5 is somewhat high; I recommend lowering it to **0.1**.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature and standard purpose.",
