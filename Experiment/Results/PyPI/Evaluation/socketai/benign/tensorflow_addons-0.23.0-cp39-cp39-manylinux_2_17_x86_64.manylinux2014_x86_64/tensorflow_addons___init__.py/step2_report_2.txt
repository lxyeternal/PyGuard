  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification & Content:**\n   - The code is a standard setup script for TensorFlow Addons, importing modules, calling functions to print warnings, and check TensorFlow version.\n   - The functions `_print_eol_warning()` and `_check_tf_version()` are internal (underscore-prefixed), which is typical for internal utility functions.\n   - No untrusted data, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n   - The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Issues:**\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The use of internal functions (`_print_eol_warning`, `_check_tf_version`) is noted but not suspicious; they are likely part of the internal utility API.\n   - The code appears to be standard library initialization code, with no anomalies.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or very low, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The reasoning for these scores is sound: no malicious activity, no obfuscation, no security risks.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - The only minor concern is the use of internal functions, which could theoretically change or behave unexpectedly, but this is a stability concern, not a security risk.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified based on this code snippet.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate:**\n   - Based on all the reports and the code content, I agree with the assigned scores.\n   - I would also assign:\n     - **Malware score:** 0\n     - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n     - **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly because of internal function calls, but not malicious)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a typical setup script for a Python library, performing environment checks and warnings.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- The internal functions used are standard for internal checks and warnings, not indicators of malicious activity.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is benign, with no security concerns.",
