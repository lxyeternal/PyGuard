  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as primarily importing modules, calling internal utility functions (_print_eol_warning, _check_tf_version), and performing standard setup tasks.\n- The functions invoked are internal (prefixed with underscores), which suggests they are meant for internal use, likely printing warnings or verifying environment versions.\n- No evidence of untrusted data input, network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The code is typical for a library initialization or setup script, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of internal functions:** Use of functions with leading underscores (_print_eol_warning, _check_tf_version) is common in internal or private APIs. Their invocation alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** None of the reports identify any suspicious behavior, such as code obfuscation, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns are observed.\n- **Security risk:** Given the above, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The overall security risk is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or overestimations:**\n- No report suggests any suspicious or malicious behavior that warrants a higher malware or risk score.\n- The use of internal functions is noted but is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, since it's a standard setup script)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code appears to be a normal, benign setup script for TensorFlow Addons. The reported scores are appropriate, and I would not recommend any increases in the malware or obfuscated scores. The overall security risk remains negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware score at 0.\n- Keep obfuscated at 0.\n- Set risk score around 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging that internal functions are used (which is standard).\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is standard library initialization code.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- Scores are reasonable and should remain as reported.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed scoring breakdown or further analysis.",
