{
  "purpose": "To provide extra utility functions and maintain TensorFlow Addons packages, including version checks and warnings.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external libraries (tensorflow_addons.utils.ensure_tf_install, tensorflow_addons.utils.tfa_eol_msg, tensorflow_addons, and tensorflow_addons.version), and function calls (_print_eol_warning(), _check_tf_version())",
  "sinks": "Function calls that output warnings (_print_eol_warning()), version checks (_check_tf_version())",
  "flows": "Import statements -> Function calls (_print_eol_warning(), _check_tf_version())",
  "anomalies": "Use of private functions with leading underscores (_print_eol_warning, _check_tf_version), which may imply internal or less documented behavior; no apparent malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of importing functions and modules from the tensorflow_addons library. It calls two internal functions, _print_eol_warning() and _check_tf_version(), which are likely used for printing end-of-life warnings and version validation. The import statements are standard for a library providing utility functions. There are no hardcoded credentials, network communications, or data manipulations that suggest malicious activity. The use of private functions (_*) does not inherently indicate malicious intent but warrants attention for potential internal mechanisms. Overall, the code is structured for utility purposes, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility setup for TensorFlow Addons, including version validation and warnings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
