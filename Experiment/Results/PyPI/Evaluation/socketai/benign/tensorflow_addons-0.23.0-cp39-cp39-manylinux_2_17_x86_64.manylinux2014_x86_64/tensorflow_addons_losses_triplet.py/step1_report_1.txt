  "purpose": "Implementation of triplet loss functions for deep metric learning, including semi-hard and hard negative mining strategies, for use in training embedding models.",
  "sources": "Imports TensorFlow modules, TensorFlow Addons utilities, and type annotations; defines internal functions for masked max/min calculations; defines loss functions and classes that process labels and embeddings.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily processes inputs to compute loss values; no data output or external connections are present; no code injection or data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input labels and embeddings are transformed and used to compute pairwise distances, then masked to find semi-hard or hard negatives/positives, leading to loss calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The functions are standard for triplet loss computations. No dynamic code execution, external network activity, or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines internal utility functions (_masked_maximum and _masked_minimum) for calculating masked maximum and minimum values within tensors. These are used within loss functions to identify semi-hard and hard triplets. The main functions (triplet_semihard_loss, triplet_hard_loss) and classes (TripletSemiHardLoss, TripletHardLoss) implement standard triplet loss algorithms used in metric learning. All inputs are tensors, and operations are confined to tensor computations with no external side effects. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The code appears to be a clean, well-documented implementation of a common deep learning loss function.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code implements standard triplet loss functions with semi-hard and hard negative mining strategies, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is typical of machine learning utility code for embedding training, with no suspicious behaviors or malicious code segments.",
