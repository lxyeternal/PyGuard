  "purpose": "Implementations of triplet loss functions for metric learning in TensorFlow, including semi-hard and hard negative mining strategies.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow, tensorflow_addons, and typeguard; functions and classes that process input tensors, calculate pairwise distances, and compute triplet loss.",
  "sinks": "Calculation of pairwise distances, loss values, and tensor manipulations that could potentially be exploited for information leakage if misused, but no direct data leaks or malicious outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (y_true, y_pred) flows through tensor conversions and distance calculations, then into loss computations involving pairwise comparisons and masking. No external data sources or sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, obfuscated features, or hidden functions. Use of standard TensorFlow and add-ons functions; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious external calls. Functions are well-documented and align with common ML practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple loss functions for triplet-based metric learning, including semi-hard and hard negative mining strategies. It uses standard TensorFlow and TensorFlow Addons utilities, performs typical tensor operations such as masking and pairwise distance calculations, and registers custom loss classes for serialization. No external network calls, file manipulations, or potential backdoors are evident. The code appears to be straightforward and adheres to standard ML practices. There are no signs of malicious code, sabotage, or privacy leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code implements standard triplet loss functions for TensorFlow, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured ML utility module with no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.",
