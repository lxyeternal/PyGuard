{
  "purpose": "Implementation of triplet loss functions for metric learning in neural networks, including semi-hard and hard negative mining.",
  "sources": "Imports tensorflow, tensorflow_addons, typeguard, and typing modules; functions for computing masked max/min, loss calculations, and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or data exfiltration points identified. No network communication or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input labels and embeddings flow into distance calculations, masked operations, and loss functions, with no external data or network transfer points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code, or obfuscated code present. Code appears to follow standard implementation patterns for loss functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for masked maximum and minimum calculations, implements triplet loss functions with semi-hard and hard negative mining strategies, and registers these as Keras serializable objects. Usage examples, input validation, and comments are standard. No suspicious code or behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected. The code leverages well-known libraries and APIs for metric learning, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate implementation of triplet loss functions for deep metric learning, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-documented, open-source style implementation.",
