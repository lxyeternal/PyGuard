  "purpose": "Implementation of triplet loss functions for metric learning in neural networks, including semi-hard and hard negative mining strategies.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow and tensorflow_addons libraries; functions that read input tensors (y_true, y_pred, margin, distance_metric); internal functions like _masked_maximum and _masked_minimum.",
  "sinks": "Tensor operations involving tf.math functions, pairwise distance calculations, mask generation, and loss computations that operate on trusted data; no sinks involve untrusted external sources.",
  "flows": "Input labels and embeddings are converted to tensors, then processed through distance metric calculations, mask creation, and loss functions, with intermediate steps like masked maximum/minimum computations and tensor reshaping. Data flows from input to tensor conversions, then to distance computations, masking, and loss calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated constructs, or hidden operations. The code follows standard implementation patterns for triplet loss with no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides well-documented functions for calculating triplet loss with semi-hard and hard negative mining. It uses standard TensorFlow and add-ons functions for distance calculation and tensor operations. The functions handle tensor conversions, masking, and loss calculations in a typical, expected manner. No external network calls, file I/O, or suspicious behaviors are present. The implementation aligns with common practices in metric learning, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of triplet loss functions for deep learning applications, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured module intended for metric learning in neural networks.",
