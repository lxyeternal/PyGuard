{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the Sigmoid Focal Cross Entropy loss function for use in machine learning models, specifically in object detection scenarios with imbalanced classes.",
  "sources": "Input tensors `y_true` and `y_pred` received from model outputs and data pipeline; imported modules such as tensorflow, tensorflow.keras, and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations on tensors but does not include any direct data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications; no suspicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors through loss computation steps, involving conversions, element-wise operations, and reduction; no external or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code follows standard loss function implementation with typical tensor operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard focal loss function with proper input validation, tensor conversions, and mathematical operations. It does not include any network communications, file system access, or hidden behaviors. All variables and functions serve legitimate loss calculation purposes. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. The structure and logic follow typical deep learning utility code, with clear input/output and parameter handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of the Sigmoid Focal Cross Entropy loss function for machine learning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard, well-documented utility function for model training.",
