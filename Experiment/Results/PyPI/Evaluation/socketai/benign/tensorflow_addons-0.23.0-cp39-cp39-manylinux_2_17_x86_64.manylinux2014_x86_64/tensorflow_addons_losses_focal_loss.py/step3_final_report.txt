  "purpose": "Implementation of Sigmoid Focal Cross Entropy loss function for handling class imbalance in classification tasks, particularly in object detection models.",
  "sources": "Input tensors y_true and y_pred, tensor conversions, and validation of gamma parameter.",
  "sinks": "Calculation of loss tensor via tensor operations; no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are converted and cast, then used in binary crossentropy calculation; results are modulated by alpha and gamma factors, and finally reduced to loss value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code follows standard practices with proper validation and tensor operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-documented implementation of the Sigmoid Focal Cross Entropy loss function, utilizing TensorFlow and Keras APIs. It includes input validation for gamma, tensor conversions, and correct application of the focal loss formula. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The implementation aligns with common deep learning practices, and the logic is straightforward and correct.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a known loss function with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign analysis.",
