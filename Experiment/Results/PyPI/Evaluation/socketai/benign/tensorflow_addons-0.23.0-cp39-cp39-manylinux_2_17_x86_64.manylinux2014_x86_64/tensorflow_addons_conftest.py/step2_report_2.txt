  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code appears to be a standard set of imports and a pytest fixture for a TensorFlow Addons testing environment.\n   - No malicious or suspicious code elements are present.\n   - The code itself does not contain any vulnerabilities, obfuscated code, or hidden malware.\n   - It is typical test setup code, with no signs of malicious intent or risky behavior.\n\n2. **Reports Analysis:**\n   - All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response content.\n   - This suggests that there is no detailed analysis, findings, or explanations provided in the reports.\n   - Without additional context, reasoning, or evidence, these reports do not identify any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity.\n\n3. **Assessment of Risks and Scores:**\n   - Since the reports are empty and do not provide any concrete evidence of issues, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be **0**, as there is no indication of obfuscation.\n   - The overall risk score should be **0**, reflecting no identified threat or vulnerability.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation:**\n   - The absence of detailed responses limits the ability to confirm or deny any issues.\n   - The code is standard testing setup, not suspicious or malicious.\n   - The reports do not contain any assumptions or claims that can be challenged.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- Based on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or risk.\n- The scores should be set to zero across the board, as there is no indication of any security concern.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis is the most reasonable and justified conclusion given the available data.",
