  "purpose": "Standard test setup for TensorFlow Addons, including imports, fixtures, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements and fixture definitions that load modules and set up testing environment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; code is purely setup and utility functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code executes setup routines only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and typical for test configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing setup with imports and fixture definitions for TensorFlow Addons. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present. The reports are empty, indicating no detailed findings or issues. Given the benign nature of the code and lack of evidence, the security risk is minimal. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is apparent, and the code does not contain any vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not provide any evidence of security issues. All scores should be zero, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
