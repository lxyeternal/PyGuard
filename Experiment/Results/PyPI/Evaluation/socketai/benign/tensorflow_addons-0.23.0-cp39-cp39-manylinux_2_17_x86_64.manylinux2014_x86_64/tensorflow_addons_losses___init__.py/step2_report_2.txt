  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, step-by-step, to determine their accuracy and consistency.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static import statements from the tensorflow_addons library. There are no dynamic executions, no data processing, and no untrusted input handling. The code is benign and straightforward.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that this is a simple import module with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- They uniformly conclude no security risks, malware, or obfuscation, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores at 0. This is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- The consistency across reports supports their validity.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n- Since all reports assign zero to malware and securityRisk, and the code is just import statements, there's no justification for higher risk scores.  \n- The code does not execute any untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated logic.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**  \n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct. There is no malicious activity, payload, or suspicious behavior.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n- All reports avoid assumptions and stick to factual analysis based on static import statements.  \n- No unwarranted vulnerabilities or malicious intent are claimed.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is a standard, safe set of import statements for TensorFlow Addons loss functions.  \n- No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
