{
  "purpose": "The code imports various loss functions from the tensorflow_addons library for use in Keras models.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the tensorflow_addons.losses module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this code only involves static imports without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and conforms to standard import practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple loss functions from the tensorflow_addons library, which are used for machine learning model training. All imports are from a well-known, open-source library, and no dynamic execution, user input handling, or suspicious behavior is present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement setup for TensorFlow Addons losses, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
