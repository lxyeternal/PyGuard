{
  "purpose": "Import various loss functions from tensorflow_addons.losses for use in machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from tensorflow_addons.losses and its submodules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or network activity; purely static imports.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or execution beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a reputable open-source library, tensorflow_addons. There is no dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or data processing. The imported functions are standard loss functions used in ML workflows. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of any code that could perform malicious actions, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the straightforward, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of import statements for TensorFlow Addons loss functions. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports accurately reflect this assessment, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
