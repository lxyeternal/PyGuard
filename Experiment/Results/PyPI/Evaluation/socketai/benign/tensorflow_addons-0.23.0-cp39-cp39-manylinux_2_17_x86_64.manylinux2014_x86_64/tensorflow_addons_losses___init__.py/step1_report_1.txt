{
  "purpose": "Importing various loss functions from the tensorflow_addons library for use in machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Imports from the tensorflow_addons.losses module and its submodules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and functions without executing untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; standard import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements for specific loss functions from the tensorflow_addons package. It contains no dynamic execution, user input, or external data processing. All imported modules are part of a reputable open-source library, and there is no indication of malicious intent. No suspicious or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign module import section for TensorFlow Addons loss functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
