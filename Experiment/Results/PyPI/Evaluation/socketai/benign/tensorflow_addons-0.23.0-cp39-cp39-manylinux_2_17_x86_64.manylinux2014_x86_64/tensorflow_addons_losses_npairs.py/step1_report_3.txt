  "purpose": "Implementations of Npairs loss functions for TensorFlow models, including standard and multilabel variants, used for metric learning.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow, typeguard, and tensorflow_addons.utils.types; functions and class constructors; tf.convert_to_tensor, tf.cast, tf.expand_dims, tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits, tf.math.reduce_mean, tf.sparse.to_dense, tf.linalg.matmul.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input leading to security issues; no data leaks or unsafe operations identified.",
  "flows": "Input tensors (y_true, y_pred) flow through conversion, casting, and normalization, then into TensorFlow loss functions, without any external or unsafe system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is standard for a TensorFlow loss function implementation, with proper use of TensorFlow APIs and serialization decorators. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for TensorFlow loss functions and defines three loss-related functions and classes. The functions convert inputs to tensors, perform type casting, compute similarity matrices, normalize labels, and calculate softmax cross-entropy loss, returning the mean loss. The classes wrap these functions for use as TensorFlow losses with optional naming. All code follows standard patterns for TensorFlow model losses, with no external input handling, system interaction, or malicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of metric learning loss functions for TensorFlow. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks are evident. The code appears safe, with no suspicious or malicious elements detected.",
