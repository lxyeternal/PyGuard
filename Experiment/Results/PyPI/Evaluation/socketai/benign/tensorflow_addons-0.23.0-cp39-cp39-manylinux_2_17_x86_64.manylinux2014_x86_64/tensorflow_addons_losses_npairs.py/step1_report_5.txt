  "purpose": "Implementation of various loss functions (npairs loss, multilabel npairs loss) for use in TensorFlow models, specifically for metric learning tasks.",
  "sources": "TensorFlow functions (`tf.convert_to_tensor`, `tf.cast`, `tf.expand_dims`, `tf.math.reduce_sum`, `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`, `tf.linalg.matmul`), typeguard decorator, and TensorFlow Addons utils.",
  "sinks": "TensorFlow functions that process `y_pred` and `y_true` for loss calculation; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (`y_true`, `y_pred`) are converted to tensors, processed (e.g., normalization, matrix multiplication), and used as labels in loss computations via softmax cross-entropy.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No unusual or obfuscated code detected. The code strictly performs standard tensor operations for loss calculations. The docstrings and comments are clear and technical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines loss functions for deep metric learning, using standard TensorFlow operations. It performs tensor conversions, reshaping, normalization, and matrix multiplications for similarity calculations. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no network calls, system modifications, or suspicious data leaks. The presence of serialization and loss registration is typical for TensorFlow/Keras modules. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate TensorFlow loss function implementations for metric learning tasks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk is very low, and the code is standard for its purpose.",
