{
  "purpose": "Implementations of npairs loss functions for TensorFlow models, including single-label and multilabel variants, with registration for Keras serialization.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow, typeguard, and tensorflow_addons; use of tf functions, constants, and variables; tensor conversions; and registration decorators.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; loss functions operate solely on provided tensors and constants, with no network I/O, file access, or data exfiltration evident.",
  "flows": "Input tensors (y_true, y_pred) are converted, possibly transformed, and used in loss calculations. No external data flow, network communication, or untrusted code execution is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is standard for TensorFlow loss implementations, with appropriate use of TensorFlow APIs and decorators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple loss functions for TensorFlow, with proper input validation, tensor conversions, and registration. No code injection, network access, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of npairs loss variants, with no suspicious or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-documented implementation of TensorFlow loss functions for metric learning tasks. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. It appears safe for use in machine learning workflows.",
