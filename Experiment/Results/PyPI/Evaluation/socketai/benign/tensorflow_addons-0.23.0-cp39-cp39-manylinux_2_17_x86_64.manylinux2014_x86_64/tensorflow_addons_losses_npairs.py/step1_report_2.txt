  "purpose": "Implementation of npairs loss functions for metric learning in TensorFlow/Keras, including support for multilabel data.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow and typeguard, functions using tf.convert_to_tensor, tf.cast, tf.expand_dims, tf.linalg.matmul, tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits, and tf.math.reduce_mean.",
  "sinks": "tf.convert_to_tensor, tf.cast, tf.expand_dims, tf.linalg.matmul, tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits, and tf.math.reduce_mean; no untrusted input or external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input data (`y_true`, `y_pred`) are converted to tensors, possibly cast, then used in loss calculations via tensor operations. No external network or file interactions observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Code primarily consists of loss function definitions and standard tensor operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines loss functions for metric learning with clear, documented logic. It uses standard TensorFlow operations without obfuscation or hidden dynamic code. No external data handling or network activity. The code is consistent with legitimate loss function implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of npairs loss functions for use in machine learning, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely utilizes TensorFlow functionalities for tensor manipulation and loss calculation.",
