  "purpose": "Implementation of npairs loss functions for metric learning, including multilabel support, using TensorFlow APIs.",
  "sources": "TensorFlow functions such as tf.convert_to_tensor, tf.cast, tf.expand_dims, tf.math.reduce_sum, tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits, tf.linalg.matmul, and tf.sparse.to_dense.",
  "sinks": "Loss computation via tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits; no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input tensors (y_true, y_pred) are converted, normalized, and passed through softmax cross-entropy loss functions; no external data flow or system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard TensorFlow loss functions for metric learning, with proper tensor conversions, normalization, and loss calculations. No external data handling or system calls suggest malicious intent. The multilabel version correctly processes sparse tensors and normalizes label intersections. All components are typical for such implementations, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of npairs loss functions for metric learning, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
