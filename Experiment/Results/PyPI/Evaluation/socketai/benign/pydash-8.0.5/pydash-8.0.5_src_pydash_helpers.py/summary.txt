  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score (0.1) is justified by the potential for misuse if functions are misapplied, but no actual vulnerabilities exist. All reports agree on the absence of malware and obfuscation, and the low risk score is appropriate."
