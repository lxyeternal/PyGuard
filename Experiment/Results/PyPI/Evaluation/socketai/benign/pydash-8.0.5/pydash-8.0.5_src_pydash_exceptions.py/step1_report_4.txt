  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'InvalidMethod' for signaling invalid method calls within the pydash library.",
  "sources": "The class definition and associated comments indicate the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or places where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or other effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior are present. The code is straightforward, adhering to standard Python practices for exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class 'InvalidMethod' that subclasses AttributeError for compatibility reasons. The class is well-documented, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated features, or suspicious patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets or external input handling. The code appears to be a standard, minimal implementation of an exception class, serving as part of a larger library. No malicious or security-sensitive behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard exception class definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It functions as intended for error signaling within the library.",
