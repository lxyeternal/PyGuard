{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for invalid method invocation in the pydash library, supporting compatibility with typing features.",
  "sources": "Import statements (__future__.annotations), class definition, module-level __all__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from external input to sensitive operations; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for type hinting support, defines __all__ for public API exposure, and creates a subclass of AttributeError intended to be used as a custom exception. The class includes a docstring explaining its purpose. No external inputs, outputs, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a straightforward exception class definition compatible with typing features, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception class definition intended for use within a larger library. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a clean, well-documented class definition.",
