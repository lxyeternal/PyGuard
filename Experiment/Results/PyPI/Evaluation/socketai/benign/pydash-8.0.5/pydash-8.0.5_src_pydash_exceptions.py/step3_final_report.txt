  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'InvalidMethod' for signaling invalid method calls within the 'pydash' library.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; class definition is static with no data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; purely defines an exception class.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is used for exception raising within other code components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class with proper documentation and standard inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, well-structured custom exception inheriting from AttributeError, with no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or obfuscation.
