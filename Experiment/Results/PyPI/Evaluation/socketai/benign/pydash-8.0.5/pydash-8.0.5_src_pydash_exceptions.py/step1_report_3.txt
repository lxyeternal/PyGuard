  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for invalid method errors in the pydash library.",
  "sources": "The code imports annotations, defines __all__, and creates a class InvalidMethod.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The comment about subclassing AttributeError is standard and for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a custom exception class for a specific error scenario in a library. It imports annotations, specifies __all__, and defines the class with a docstring. There are no inputs, external data, or execution flows that could introduce security risks. The class inherits from AttributeError as specified, for compatibility reasons. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe exception class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as part of a larger library's error handling mechanism and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
