  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code defines a single custom exception class, `InvalidMethod`, inheriting from `AttributeError`.\n- The code includes standard Python practices: import of `__future__.annotations`, setting `__all__`, and a descriptive docstring.\n- No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and validations:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code is straightforward and correctly implements a custom exception class.\n   - No issues, errors, or flaws are present in the code itself.\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and well-structured.\n\n2. **Scores assessment:**\n   - Malware score: 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n   - Security risk: 0, since the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Risk score justification:**\n   - The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is justified given the code's benign and straightforward purpose.\n   - No reason to increase the risk score.\n\n4. **Malware score justification:**\n   - The malware score is 0, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions are made about external data or behaviors.\n   - The code is purely definitional and does not execute or process data.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - All scores align with the code's characteristics.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign exception class with no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class for use within the `pydash` library.\n- All reports correctly identify its benign nature.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The code poses no security risk, malware concern, or obfuscation.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scoring and analysis are appropriate and accurate.",
