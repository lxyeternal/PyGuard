  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward class definition for `InvalidMethod`, inheriting from `AttributeError`.\n   - It includes standard practices: importing `annotations` for type hints, defining `__all__`, and adding descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows involved.\n   - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code appears to be a minimal, well-documented exception class meant for use within the `pydash` library.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and intended for error handling.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are noted.\n   - The analysis correctly states that there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all zero, which is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n   - The code is purely definitional and does not process external data.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's content, not assumptions.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks present.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code's purpose is to define a custom exception class, which is inherently safe.\n- The detailed comments and structure reinforce its benign intent.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a standard, safe exception class with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
