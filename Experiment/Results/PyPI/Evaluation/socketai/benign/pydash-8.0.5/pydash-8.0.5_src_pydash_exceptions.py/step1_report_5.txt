  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for invalid method calls within the pydash library, specifically for chaining methods.",
  "sources": "The class InvalidMethod is defined without reading external input; no data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or outputted; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external input or untrusted data; the class is a simple exception definition.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, with a comment explaining subclassing behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from AttributeError, intended for handling invalid method calls in pydash. It includes descriptive comments, a versionadded note, and an __all__ declaration. There are no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. The structure and content are typical for a minimal exception class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception class definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves a specific purpose within the pydash library and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
