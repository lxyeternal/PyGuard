  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines a single custom exception class `InvalidMethod`, inheriting from `AttributeError`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external inputs, data processing, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are evident.\n- The purpose is to provide a specific exception type for the pydash library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a simple, benign class definition with no security concerns. There are no actual issues present in the code.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Any errors?**  \n  No errors or flaws are identified. The code follows standard Python practices, and the comments clarify compatibility considerations.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign a risk score of 0 or 0.5. Given the code's benign nature, a score of 0 is justified. No security risk exists here.\n\n### Justification for risk score > 0.5:\n- **Should any risk score be higher?**  \n  No. The code is purely defining an exception class, with no external inputs, outputs, or behaviors that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Correctly assigned as 0. No malicious behavior or intent is present.\n\n### Assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as a simple exception class.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- **Are scores consistent?**  \n  Yes. All reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a minimal, standard exception class with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is benign, well-documented, and serves a clear purpose within a larger library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- No further security concerns are warranted.\n\n**This review confirms the code is safe and free of security issues.**",
