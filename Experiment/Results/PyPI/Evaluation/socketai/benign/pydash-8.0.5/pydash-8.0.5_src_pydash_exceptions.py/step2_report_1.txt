  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines a single custom exception class `InvalidMethod` that subclasses `AttributeError`.\n   - It imports `__future__.annotations` for forward reference support.\n   - It declares `__all__ = (\"InvalidMethod\",)` for explicit public API exposure.\n   - The class includes a docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and adheres to standard Python practices for defining exceptions.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Issues:**\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The purpose is to serve as a specific exception within the `pydash` library, which is typical and benign.\n   - The code comments and structure indicate good documentation and clarity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — The code itself does not introduce security risks; it's a simple exception class.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n   - All reports uniformly agree on the benign nature of this code.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard exception class with no suspicious behavior.\n   - No need to adjust scores; they are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is intended for use within a larger library, the only potential concern could be if it were exploited in some way, but as-is, it’s a benign class definition.\n   - The class inherits from `AttributeError`, which is appropriate for signaling invalid attribute or method access, aligning with its purpose.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign exception class.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe and standard for its intended purpose.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports' consensus.",
