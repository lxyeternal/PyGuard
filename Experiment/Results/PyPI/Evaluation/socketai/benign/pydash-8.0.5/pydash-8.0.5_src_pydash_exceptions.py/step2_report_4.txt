  "review": "Let's review the reports carefully and analyze the code's security implications step-by-step.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code defines a simple custom exception class `InvalidMethod` inheriting from `AttributeError`.\n   - It imports `annotations` from `__future__` for compatibility.\n   - It specifies `__all__` to expose the exception class.\n   - The class includes a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - No external inputs, outputs, or data processing are present.\n   - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a straightforward, benign exception class with no issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent, detailed, and agree that the code is simple, well-documented, and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly identify the code as non-malicious and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and do not contain mistakes.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk scores assigned are 0, indicating no security concern.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - No external data handling or code execution is involved.\n\n**Conclusion:** No justification exists for higher risk scores; current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n   - The class is a standard exception class.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score is correct at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code as a benign, standard exception class.\n\n**Conclusion:** No questionable claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard exception class intended for use within a larger library.\n- No security issues, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, well-documented, and free of security concerns. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
