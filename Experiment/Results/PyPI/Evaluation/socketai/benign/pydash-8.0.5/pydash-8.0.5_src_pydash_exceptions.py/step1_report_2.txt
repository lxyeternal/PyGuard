  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class InvalidMethod for use within the pydash library, specifically when an invalid method is invoked.",
  "sources": "The class definition itself; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class does not process data or interact with external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python practices for defining exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations for compatibility, defines __all__ for exports, and creates a subclass of AttributeError with a descriptive docstring. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or code execution functionalities. The class is meant to serve as a specific exception type for the pydash library. The code is simple, clean, and adheres to standard conventions without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception class definition intended for use within a larger codebase. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation present.",
