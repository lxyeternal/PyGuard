  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and determine appropriate scores based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** The report states \"Empty response\" with no raw response data. No detailed analysis is provided.\n- **Assessment:** Since there's no information, we cannot confirm any issues, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Given the lack of data, malware and obfuscated scores should be 0. The security risk is minimal; a score of 0.2 might be slightly high but acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity. The report is essentially a placeholder.\n\n**Adjusted scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2 (acceptable)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** The report claims the code is a comprehensive list utility library with no malicious behavior, highlighting safe usage of external libraries like pydash, and no network or system calls.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily data manipulation with no network, file, or code execution involved. Use of pydash functions for dynamic property access and iteratees is standard, and no malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Scores justification:** The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected. Obfuscated is 0, given no obfuscation or hidden code. Security risk is low (0.2), considering potential misuse if external data is malicious, but overall safe.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the report's assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Adjusted scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2 (consistent)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** Similar to report 2, emphasizing standard list operations, no external threats, no network, no file I/O, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a typical utility library. The use of pydash and internal helpers is standard. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n- **Scores justification:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0. given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard utility code.\n\n**Adjusted scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** Again, a list utility library with no malicious behavior, no external communication, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code operates solely on in-memory data structures, uses open-source libraries, and has no network or system calls.\n- **Scores justification:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0. The report's confidence is high, and the analysis is sound.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Adjusted scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe, standard list operations with no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a straightforward utility module. No network, file, or code execution. Use of open-source libraries like pydash is standard.\n- **Scores justification:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1 (very low).\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and benign.\n\n**Adjusted scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all are 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign utility nature of the code.\n\n### **Final estimation:**\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, the code is a standard, open-source list utility library with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements.\n\n**My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal risk, mainly due to potential misuse if external data is malicious, but the code itself is safe)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior. The existing scores are appropriate, and I recommend maintaining them at the low end.",
