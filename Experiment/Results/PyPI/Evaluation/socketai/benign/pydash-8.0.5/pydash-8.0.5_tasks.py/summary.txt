  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured project management CLI script with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1–0.2), justified by the controlled execution environment. The assessments across all reports are consistent and appropriate."
