{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for operating on lists and dictionaries, including iteration, grouping, sorting, and data extraction.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, standard libraries (functools, random, typing), external library pydash, local helpers, and types modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses random.choice and random.sample for random data selection; no other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User inputs or external data flow into functions like group_by, order_by, filter_, find, map_, etc., which process and return data; no data is sent externally or over network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of random for sampling is benign, and functions operate purely on provided data. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code offers a suite of data manipulation functions typical of utility libraries. It uses external libraries responsibly, with no evidence of malicious intent. No operations involve network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration. Random functions are used for sampling, which is standard. The code processes data passed as arguments and returns processed results; no external or hidden data flows or injections are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility library for list and dict operations without any malicious behavior or sabotage. There are no signs of malware, data leakage, or supply chain attacks. It is a benign, well-structured module for data manipulation.",
