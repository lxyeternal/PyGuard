  "purpose": "Collection of utility functions for list and dict operations, including mapping, filtering, grouping, sorting, and reduction.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, external libraries (pydash), standard Python modules (random). No external data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'random.choice', 'random.sample', 'random.shuffle' for randomness; 'pyd.invoke' for dynamic method invocation.",
  "flows": "Data flows into functions that perform data transformations, sampling, shuffling, and dynamic method calls. 'pyd.invoke' can invoke arbitrary methods if inputs are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of 'pyd.invoke' and randomness functions are standard but could be misused.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility library for data manipulation with no malicious payloads. The primary security concern is the use of 'pyd.invoke' within 'invoke_map', which can execute arbitrary methods if provided with untrusted input. No network activity or system modifications are present. The use of randomness functions is benign in this context. The code is transparent and well-structured, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the potential for misuse but do not indicate active malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility library with no signs of malware or sabotage. The potential security risk stems from the dynamic invocation feature, which should be used cautiously with untrusted inputs. Overall, the code is safe for general use, and the scores are appropriate.",
