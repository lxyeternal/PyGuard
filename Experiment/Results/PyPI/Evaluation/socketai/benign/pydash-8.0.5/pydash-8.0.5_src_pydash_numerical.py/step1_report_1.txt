{
  "purpose": "The code provides a collection of numerical and mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, mean, median, max, min, standard deviation, z-score, and related utilities for data processing and analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from collections such as lists, dictionaries, and iterables via functions like iteriteratee, iterator, iterator_with_default, and pyd.map_.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data transmissions are present; the functions operate entirely within the local environment, performing calculations and returning numerical results.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (collections, inputs to functions) through processing steps (e.g., iteration, mathematical operations) to return numerical outputs. For example, collection elements are processed via iteratee functions, then calculations like mean, median, or z-score are performed, returning numerical results.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to implement standard mathematical operations with support for multiple data types, including decimal and list processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous numerical functions with type annotations, overloads, and safeguards. It uses safe operator calls and exception handling in functions like call_math_operator. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. The functions perform standard mathematical calculations, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. All inputs and outputs are consistent with typical data processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard mathematical utility module designed for numerical computations. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The functions are well-structured, and there are no signs of malware or malicious data leaks. The code appears safe for use within a data processing context.",
