  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and the consistency of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a collection of standard numerical functions, no external data transmission, no suspicious patterns, and uses safe practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's behavior. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature, safe data handling, and lack of external operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Again, consistent with the code. No issues detected. The zero risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the mathematical nature, safe operations, no network or file I/O, and benign patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely computational, with no malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the standard numerical functions, safe data processing, no external data leaks, and standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (still low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) but still very low, considering no external or malicious activity. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, standard data handling, no external side effects, and safe operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent. The code performs straightforward numerical computations with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low across all reports, justified by the code's nature—no external communication, no file I/O, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly because of the use of float('inf') and some dynamic operator usage, but these are standard and safe in context)\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a well-structured numerical utility library. It employs safe programming practices, uses standard libraries, and performs computations in-memory without external side effects. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable, and I agree with their conclusions. The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation detected.",
