{
  "purpose": "This code provides a collection of numerical and mathematical utility functions, operating solely on in-memory data without external data flows or network interactions.",
  "sources": "The functions read data from collections, iterables, and parameters passed directly to each function, with no external data sources or input streams.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks such as network connections, file I/O, or environment variables are present; all operations are in-memory calculations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through computations within functions, with no external data transmission or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code behaviors are detected. Use of float('inf') is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of numerical functions such as addition, subtraction, mean, median, standard deviation, and others, relying on standard Python libraries and safe practices. No external communication, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. Helper functions are used but their implementation isn't suspicious. The functions process data passed as arguments, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The overall structure is clear, well-documented, and adheres to safe coding standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign numerical utility library with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the safe and standard nature of the implementation.",
