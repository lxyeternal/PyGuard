{
  "purpose": "Provides numerical and mathematical functions for data analysis, including operations like addition, subtraction, mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistical calculations.",
  "sources": "Input data collections for functions such as sum_, mean, median, min_, max_, zscore, moving_mean, etc., which read elements from lists, iterables, or mappings.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data transformations occur in functions like call_math_operator, rounder, and scale, where untrusted or manipulated inputs could be converted or used in calculations. However, there are no direct data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input collections (sources) pass through functions (like mean_by, median, zscore), possibly undergoing iteratee transformations, then used in calculations that generate numeric outputs. No external system calls or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The code performs standard mathematical operations with input validation. No obfuscated code, malicious network connections, or unauthorized data access are detected. Helper functions are imported, but their implementation isn't shown, so some risk remains if they are malicious; however, based on provided code, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple mathematical utility functions with extensive type annotations and overloading for flexibility. Input validation relies on external helper functions, but no dangerous behavior like network access, file modification, or secret exfiltration is apparent. Operations are standard arithmetic or data processing routines. The code appears to be legitimate for numerical analysis purposes. No evidence of malicious code, sabotage, or security exploits is identified based on the provided content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of numerical computation functions with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs typical data analysis tasks securely, assuming helper functions are safe. Overall, it is low risk, with no malware indications.",
