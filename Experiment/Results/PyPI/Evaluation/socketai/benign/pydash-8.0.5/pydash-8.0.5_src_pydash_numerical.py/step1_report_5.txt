{
  "purpose": "The code provides a collection of numerical and mathematical utility functions such as addition, subtraction, mean, median, standard deviation, and others, intended for data processing and analysis.",
  "sources": "Code reads data primarily from input parameters passed to functions, such as collections (lists, dictionaries), points (tuples/lists), and optional iteratees for data transformation.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from source inputs to outputs, typically involving calculations or transformations. No direct sinks like network connections or file writes are present. No untrusted data handling outside of parameter inputs, which are processed locally.",
  "flows": "Input data is retrieved from function arguments, optionally processed through iteratees, then calculations are performed (e.g., mean, median, variance). Results are returned directly, with no external data transmission or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of third-party library 'pydash' is for utility functions, not inherently malicious. No obfuscated or misleading code features detected. Exception handling is minimal but standard for numerical operations.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically implements common mathematical functions with proper handling of collections and optional iteratees. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Functions perform calculations within expected parameters, using standard Python modules and practices. No suspicious code or behaviors are identified; the code appears to be a straightforward utility module for numerical data analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious utility module for mathematical operations. It does not contain any malware or security risks. It securely processes data passed as function arguments and returns results without external side effects. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
