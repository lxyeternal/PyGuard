  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard numerical utility library with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The confidence is high (0.95), malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.1).\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code performs standard math functions with no signs of malware. The reasoning is sound, noting the absence of network, file, or dynamic code execution. The low security risk score is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Verdict:** The malware score of 0 and security risk of 0.1 are reasonable. The confidence level is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature, standard operations, no malicious behavior, and safe practices. The confidence is even higher (1), malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The use of external libraries like 'pydash' is standard.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a mathematical utility library with no external data leaks, network operations, or malicious patterns. The analysis emphasizes safe use of standard libraries and absence of obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The only minor note is the use of float('inf') for INFINITY, which is benign. No suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n- **Verdict:** Malware score of 0 and security risk of 0 are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The functions are standard, with no network or file I/O, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets. The analysis is thorough, with a focus on safe data handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The only potential concern is reliance on helper functions (like 'pydash') and their safety, but given the context, no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Verdict:** Malware score of 0 and security risk of 0.2 are reasonable. Slightly higher risk score due to reliance on external helpers, but overall low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward mathematical utility with no malicious behavior, no external data leaks, and standard practices.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n- **Verdict:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, confidence high.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious patterns, network access, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports rate this as 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation—most are very low (0.1 to 0.2), which is appropriate given the benign nature. The slightly higher risk (0.2) in report 4 is justified due to external helper functions, but overall, the code remains safe.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to external dependencies, but no actual risk.\n\n**Note:** The code is a well-implemented numerical utility library with no malicious or obfuscated components. The scores are appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The scores reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No changes are necessary.",
