  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a collection of numerical functions, operating solely on in-memory data, with no external data flows or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, as the code is standard math utilities.\n- **Analysis:** The functions are standard, well-structured, and rely on safe libraries. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data processing with no external communication or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — safe for in-memory data processing.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, code is straightforward.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The scores align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard mathematical functions with no external data flows or malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — purely computational.\n- **Analysis:** No network, file I/O, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment—functions for numerical calculations, no external data leaks or malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — still low, as the functions are standard, but slight concern over reliance on helper functions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected; the only minor concern could be the helper functions, but based on provided code, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard data processing functions with no external or malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — safe for data analysis.\n- **Analysis:** No network, file, or external data access. Functions operate on inputs only.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the absence of external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard numerical utility library. No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external data leaks, and no malicious behavior are evident. The use of helper functions is standard, and their implementation isn't provided, but nothing in the visible code suggests malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to the potential for misuse if helper functions are malicious, but unlikely given the context.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe for use in any data processing or analysis context.",
