{
  "purpose": "This module provides various numerical and mathematical functions, including statistical calculations, arithmetic operations, and data transformations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments such as collections, points, and arrays. It also imports functions from external libraries (math, operator, pydash, and internal helpers).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of eval-like functions (none present), network communication (none present), or unsafe data handling (none observed). No data leakage points are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through processing functions, with no external data outputs or network operations. Computations are purely in-memory.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic functions like operator functions, but no obfuscation or malicious control flow is present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are identified. The only potential concern is the use of float('inf') for INFINITY, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements mathematical operations, statistical calculations, and data transformations with no network or file I/O, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials. It relies on standard libraries and safe programming patterns. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage. The functions are straightforward, and no suspicious data handling or external communication is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate mathematical utility library with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs numerical computations safely and does not include network or I/O operations that could be exploited. There are no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious code.",
