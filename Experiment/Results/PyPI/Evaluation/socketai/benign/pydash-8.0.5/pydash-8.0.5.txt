The potential security risk stems from the dynamic invocation feature, which should be used cautiously with untrusted inputs. Overall, the code is safe for general use, and the scores are appropriate."

The minimal security risk score (0.1) is justified by the potential for misuse if functions are misapplied, but no actual vulnerabilities exist. All reports agree on the absence of malware and obfuscation, and the low risk score is appropriate."
