  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for functional programming, path manipulation, random number generation, retries, stubs, and other helpers used in larger projects.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments, environment variables (indirectly via imported modules), and constants. Uses regex to parse path strings, and reads built-in modules for time, random, datetime, etc.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'random' functions (randint, uniform) for random number generation; potentially influences randomness but not malicious. Calls external functions passed as arguments (e.g., on_exception, iteratee), which could be malicious if untrusted, but this is user-supplied, not in the code itself.",
  "flows": "Path parsing functions extract data from string or list inputs; 'attempt', 'retry', 'memoize', and similar functions execute user-provided callables or lambdas. No direct data exfiltration or network activity present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden network activities detected. Random number generation is standard. Functions like 'unique_id' increment a global counter without external influence. Path parsing uses regex but no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. 'retry' includes jitter and delay logic but nothing suspicious. No code performs data exfiltration, system modification, or network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for functional programming and path manipulation. No embedded or obfuscated malicious code, no network activity, no system modifications. The use of regex for path parsing is standard. Functions accept user-supplied callables but do not contain any malicious code themselves. The global ID counter is simple and not malicious. Randomness functions are standard. The retry decorator includes sleep delays with jitter but no harmful effects. Overall, the code appears to be a benign collection of helpers without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of general-purpose utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard operations such as path parsing, retries, memoization, and random number generation. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The overall security risk is very low.",
