{
  "purpose": "The code provides a collection of utility functions for functional programming, path parsing, retries, memoization, randomness, and other helpers. It is designed to facilitate common programming patterns without any malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Functions read input parameters, global variables, and internal data structures; no external data sources or system calls are involved.",
  "sinks": "Data flows are internal; no untrusted data is written to network, files, or environment variables. No sinks that could lead to data leaks or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (parameters, internal variables) are processed within functions; no external or unsafe data flows are detected. Path parsing and random number generation are self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. Regex and string manipulations are straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions with standard implementations, including retries with delays, path conversions, memoization, random number generation, and function composition. No network activity, system modifications, or obfuscated code are evident. The functions behave as expected for utility purposes. The use of delays and randomness could be misused in specific contexts but are typical in such libraries. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module with no malicious behavior or security risks. The minor potential for misuse (e.g., in 'retry') is inherent to utility functions and not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
