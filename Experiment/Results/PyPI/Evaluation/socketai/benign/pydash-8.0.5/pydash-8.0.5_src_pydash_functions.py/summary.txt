  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility library for function manipulation with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to the presence of timing utilities which are common in such libraries. The assessments in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior and structure."
