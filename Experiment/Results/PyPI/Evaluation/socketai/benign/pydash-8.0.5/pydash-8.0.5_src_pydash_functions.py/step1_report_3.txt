{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of function decorators and wrappers for functional programming constructs such as currying, composition, memoization, throttling, and argument manipulation.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from function arguments, internally defined functions, and imported modules; no external input sources or user data inputs are directly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Function calls and data passing occur within the wrapper classes and functions, with no evidence of untrusted data handling or external data transmission; no sinks for external data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Function definitions serve as sources; wrapped function calls are the flows; there are no external or network flows, nor data exfiltration points observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The code mostly contains standard function wrappers with typical argument handling. No suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of various function wrappers implementing common functional programming patterns: decorators for call-limited, argument-capped, argument-rearranged, composition, negation, and throttling. The classes and functions are designed to wrap existing callables and do not perform any external communication, file access, or hidden operations. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code's structure is consistent with open-source utility libraries, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of standard libraries and the absence of suspicious patterns suggest low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of function wrappers for functional programming paradigms with no detectable malicious behavior. It appears to be an open-source utility module designed for safe use in larger projects. No indicators of malware or security risks are identified.",
