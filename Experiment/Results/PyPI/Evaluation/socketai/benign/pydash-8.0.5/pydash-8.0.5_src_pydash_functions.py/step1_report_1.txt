{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for function wrapping, composition, and argument manipulation in Python, aimed at enhancing functional programming capabilities.",
  "sources": "Inputs are primarily read from function arguments within each class's __call__ method and the parameters passed to the utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calls to the wrapped functions (e.g., self.func(*args, **kwargs)), which execute arbitrary passed-in callables; however, these are standard in such utility libraries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs (function arguments) into wrapper classes, which then invoke the user-supplied functions, potentially with argument transformations or rearrangements, but no external data sources like network or file IO are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code extensively uses standard function wrapping and composition techniques. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present. No external or hidden network connections, data leaks, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple wrapper classes and functions for common functional programming patterns such as currying, composition, argument manipulation, throttling, debouncing, and negation. All operations involve standard function calls and argument handling without any external data access, network operations, or system modifications. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. The use of third-party libraries appears confined to utility functions (e.g., pydash) for time and iteration management. The functions operate solely on input arguments and user-provided callables, with no suspicious code pathways or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a utility library for function manipulation with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs typical patterns for functional programming without any suspicious or malicious behaviors. No security risks or malware signatures are identified.",
