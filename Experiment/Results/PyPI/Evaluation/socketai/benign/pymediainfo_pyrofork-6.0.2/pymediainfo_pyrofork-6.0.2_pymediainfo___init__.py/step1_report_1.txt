{
  "purpose": "This module acts as a wrapper around the MediaInfo library to analyze media files and extract metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads input from file paths, file-like objects, environment variables, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Uses external media libraries via ctypes, potentially receiving untrusted data from files or network sources.",
  "flows": "Media file data flows from input files or buffers through the MediaInfo library functions, then parsed into Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code found. No evidence of obfuscated code or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily wraps a native media analysis library using ctypes. It handles file input, buffer reading, and library option settings carefully. No suspicious network activity or system modifications are present. The library loading process is robust with exception handling. Data is parsed and exposed via Python objects with no evident malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or harmful commands are detected. The code adheres to standard practices for dynamic library loading and media data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate media metadata parser wrapper with proper safety measures. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The potential risks are limited to the use of external native libraries and untrusted media files, which are outside the scope of this code itself. Overall, the code appears safe.",
