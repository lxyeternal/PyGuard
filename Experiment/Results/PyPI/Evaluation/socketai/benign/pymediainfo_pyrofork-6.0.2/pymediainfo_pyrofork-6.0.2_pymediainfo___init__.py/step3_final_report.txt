{
  "purpose": "A wrapper around the MediaInfo library for extracting media file metadata, supporting file, buffer, and URL inputs, and parsing XML output into Python objects.",
  "sources": "Reads media files (via filename, URL, or buffer), environment variables, package metadata, and user-supplied options.",
  "sinks": "Calls external libmediainfo functions via ctypes; outputs structured data or JSON; no network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Media files or buffers are processed through libmediainfo functions, with data flowing into Python data structures; options influence library behavior but are controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code. Library loading is dynamic but standard; passing user options is flexible but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured wrapper around libmediainfo, with proper error handling, version checks, and resource management. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. Library paths are checked dynamically, and data flows are controlled. Passing arbitrary options is a feature, not a vulnerability. No network activity or code injection detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe wrapper for libmediainfo, with no malicious intent or sabotage. The low risk score (around 0.2) reflects the inherent risks of external library handling and untrusted media input, which are typical for such tools but do not indicate malicious behavior.",
