  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report, verifying the claims, the scoring, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a legitimate wrapper around MediaInfo, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. It emphasizes proper handling of native libraries, safe data flow, and absence of suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code review. The code's purpose is to interface with an external C library, which is standard for such tools. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation is found. The low security risk score is appropriate, considering the external library's trustworthiness and the controlled data flow.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe library loading, parsing, and data handling. No malicious intent or code detected. The use of external libraries and dynamic loading is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is a standard wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity. The very low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the use of `libmediainfo` functions, handling of options, and media file analysis. Notes that passing untrusted options via `mediainfo_options` could be a concern but is intended for configuration.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies that the code's purpose is to interface with an external library, with potential concern over user-supplied options. However, this is a legitimate feature, not malicious. The risk score remains low, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a standard wrapper, with careful handling of library loading, input, and XML parsing. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that the code processes media files or URLs, uses dynamic library loading, and manages data securely. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is a legitimate media info wrapper, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious activity, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, which is correct. The code is transparent and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The scores are low, mostly around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concerns. The only potential concern is the passing of arbitrary options via `mediainfo_options`, but this is a feature, not a vulnerability.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented wrapper around an external native library. It handles input, library loading, and data parsing securely. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The potential risks are inherent to any external library usage and handling untrusted media files, but these are outside the scope of the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code appears safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified given the context.",
