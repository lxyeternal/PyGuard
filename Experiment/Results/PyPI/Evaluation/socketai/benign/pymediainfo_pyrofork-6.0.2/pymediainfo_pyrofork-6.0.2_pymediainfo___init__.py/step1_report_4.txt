  "anomalies": [
    "Uses of warnings.warn to warn about unsupported options on older mediainfo versions",
    "Dynamic loading of libraries based on platform, potential for incorrect library paths",
    "Handling of media files via filename or file-like object, with explicit binary mode check",
    "Graceful handling of library version differences, but no apparent obfuscation or suspicious code"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code functions primarily as an interface to the libmediainfo shared library, with comprehensive handling of media file analysis, including dynamic library loading, version checks, and XML parsing into structured data objects. It uses ctypes to call native functions and manages file/buffer input correctly, including error handling and resource cleanup. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network connections, or suspicious code patterns are present. The only areas to note are standard configuration options and library loading procedures, which are typical for such wrappers. The implementation appears clean, transparent, and consistent with legitimate usage, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured Python wrapper around libmediainfo, designed for extracting media metadata. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage indications. Its actions are limited to configuration, file handling, and XML data processing for legitimate purposes. Overall security risk is minimal.",
