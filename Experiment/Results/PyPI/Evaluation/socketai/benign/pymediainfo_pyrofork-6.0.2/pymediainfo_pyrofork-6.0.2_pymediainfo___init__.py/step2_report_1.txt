  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the module as a wrapper for MediaInfo, reading from files, environment, and package metadata.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses external libraries via ctypes; data flows from media files/buffers to parsed Python objects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Library loading is robust, with exception handling. No network activity or system modifications.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; the code appears safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to external library handling)  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the class structure, XML parsing, and library handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows involve reading media files/XML, processing via libmediainfo, and returning structured data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious intent. Library paths are checked dynamically; no suspicious network activity. The use of ctypes is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, safe handling)  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the wrapper's role, with media files and options.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** User options via `mediainfo_options` are passed to the native library; files/buffers are processed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The ability to pass arbitrary options could, in theory, be misused, but this is a feature, not malicious. No network activity or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly assessed; no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (acceptable, considering flexibility)  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a wrapper with detailed handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Library calls, filename/buffer processing, XML parsing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Library loading is dynamic but standard; no suspicious patterns. No code injection or network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; code is legitimate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal)  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the wrapper's functions, input types, and library handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from input files/URLs/buffers into libmediainfo functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The main concern is the ability to process URLs and pass user-defined options, which could be misused if inputs are malicious. However, this is typical for media analysis tools, not malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is appropriate; no malicious behavior or sabotage is evident.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (acceptable given the context)  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a legitimate, well-structured wrapper around libmediainfo.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — the code is a standard media info wrapper, no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — low, primarily due to the use of external libraries and the ability to process URLs or pass custom options, which is standard but could be misused if inputs are malicious.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is safe, with minimal security risk inherent in its external dependencies and flexible input handling, which is typical for such media processing libraries.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage. The code is a legitimate, well-implemented wrapper for libmediainfo.",
