  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'pymediainfo' project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'os', 'setuptools_scm', and conditional import of 'importlib.metadata'; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes configuration variables; there are no data flows or processing of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard Sphinx configuration; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual variable manipulation is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation, setting various options for HTML, LaTeX, manual pages, and other output formats. It imports necessary modules for versioning and path handling, with conditional import to support different environments. There are no input sources, no untrusted data handling, nor any code execution based on external data. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The only notable aspect is the use of 'setuptools_scm' to fetch version info, which is common for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling mechanisms. The overall security risk is negligible.",
