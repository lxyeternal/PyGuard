  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building project documentation using Sphinx for the 'pymediainfo' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly 'setuptools_scm' and 'importlib.metadata' / 'importlib_metadata', and any dynamic version retrieval via 'setuptools_scm.get_version()'.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'setuptools_scm.get_version()' retrieves version info dynamically, but this is a standard practice and not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Source: Import statements and version retrieval; Sink: Version variable assignment 'version' and 'release'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no external network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file. It imports necessary modules, sets configuration options, and retrieves version info dynamically using 'setuptools_scm.get_version()'. All code appears to be for legitimate configuration purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The only potentially dynamic element is version retrieval, which is standard and safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are detected.",
