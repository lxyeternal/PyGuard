{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building project documentation using Sphinx for the 'pymediainfo' Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements (os, setuptools_scm, importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata), version retrieval via setuptools_scm.get_version.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Import and version retrieval flow, with no data flowing from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration constants are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The version is obtained from setuptools_scm, which is standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with typical imports and settings. The only dynamic code executes 'setuptools_scm.get_version' to determine the project version, which is a common practice. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network calls, and no data manipulations indicative of malicious activity. The file is purely for documentation build setup, with no malicious behaviors or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal configuration file for documentation purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily imports modules and sets configuration options, all of which are standard and safe.",
