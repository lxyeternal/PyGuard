  "purpose": "This code is a configuration script for Sphinx documentation build setup, defining parameters such as extensions, theme, version retrieval, and output options.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration variables and imports modules (`os`, `setuptools_scm`, conditional import of `importlib.metadata`) for version management.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially harmful operations; no external data or network activity is present.",
  "flows": "The only dynamic flow is retrieving version info via `setuptools_scm.get_version()`, which is a standard, safe practice and does not involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical static configuration file for Sphinx documentation, importing standard modules and setting parameters. The dynamic version retrieval via `setuptools_scm.get_version()` is common and safe. No user input, network activity, or code execution based on untrusted sources is detected. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
