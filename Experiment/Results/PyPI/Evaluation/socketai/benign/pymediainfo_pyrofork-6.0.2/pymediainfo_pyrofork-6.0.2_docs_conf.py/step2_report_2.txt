  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file for the 'pymediainfo' project.\n- It primarily imports modules (`os`, `setuptools_scm`, conditional import of `importlib.metadata`) and sets configuration variables.\n- The only dynamic element is the use of `setuptools_scm.get_version()` to retrieve the project version, which is a common and safe practice.\n- No user input, network activity, or data processing from untrusted sources is present.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or malicious functions are detected.\n- The configuration is static and intended solely for documentation build purposes.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a configuration script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risk:** All reports assign scores of 0 for malware and security risk, which is appropriate.\n- **Dynamic version retrieval:** While dynamic, using `setuptools_scm.get_version()` is standard; no reason to suspect malicious intent.\n- **Potential assumptions:** Some reports mention \"potential vulnerabilities\" or \"suspicious code\" based on the dynamic version retrieval, but this is a standard practice and not inherently risky.\n- **Inconsistencies:** All reports are consistent in their analysis and scoring.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a benign, standard configuration file.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and reasonable.\n- The analysis in all reports aligns with the code's actual content.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:** Given the detailed review, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is entirely benign.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code poses no security threat.",
