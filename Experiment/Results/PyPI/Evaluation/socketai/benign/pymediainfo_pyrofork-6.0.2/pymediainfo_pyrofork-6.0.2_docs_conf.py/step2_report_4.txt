  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file for building documentation for the 'pymediainfo' project.\n- It imports common modules ('os', 'setuptools_scm', 'importlib.metadata' / 'importlib_metadata') with fallback handling.\n- Uses 'setuptools_scm.get_version()' to dynamically retrieve version info—this is a common practice.\n- No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution based on untrusted data.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or signs of malware.\n- The configuration solely manages static setup parameters for documentation generation.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation.\n- Findings: No suspicious code, no data leaks, no anomalies.\n- Conclusion: Completely benign, no malware or security risk.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard configuration.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to above, focusing on version retrieval via 'setuptools_scm'.\n- Findings: The dynamic version retrieval is standard; no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign code.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Standard Sphinx configuration.\n- Findings: No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no network activity.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is purely configuration.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Documentation build setup.\n- Findings: No untrusted data, no network calls, no anomalies.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard setup.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No security concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar configuration, focusing on static setup.\n- Findings: No data flows from untrusted sources, no suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Completely benign.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Security Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. The code contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is clear, readable, and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5 or below. The code is purely configuration, with no dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** No signs of malicious code, no obfuscated code, no external network calls, no code injection.\n- **Obfuscated:** The code is straightforward; no obfuscation or concealment.\n- **Risk:** The only minor concern could be the dynamic version retrieval, but this is a common, safe practice and does not pose a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The overall security risk of this code is negligible.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe analyzed code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identified its harmless nature.",
