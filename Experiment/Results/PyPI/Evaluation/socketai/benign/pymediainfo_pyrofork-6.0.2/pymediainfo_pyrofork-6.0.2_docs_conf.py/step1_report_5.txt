  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building project documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import statements, setuptools_scm.get_version call, and any file paths or environment variables used in configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with import statements, setup for extensions, paths, theme options, and output formats. It imports 'setuptools_scm' to determine project version, which is a typical approach for versioning documentation. There are no user inputs, no data reading from untrusted sources, nor any network or file operations that could pose security risks. The file strictly manages static configuration data without executing dynamic or potentially malicious code. All imported modules are common, and no dangerous functions or code injection points are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe configuration script for documentation generation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs standard setup tasks without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
