  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation of the pymediainfo project",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, setuptools_scm, importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata, and configuration variables",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output affecting system security",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; configuration variables are static",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious imports; all code appears to be standard configuration setup for documentation",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with imports, extension setups, project metadata, and output options. The imported modules are standard for versioning and metadata, with fallback handling for importlib_metadata. No user input, network activity, or malicious functions are present. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected; the code solely manages documentation build settings.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
