{
  "purpose": "To demonstrate how to call the pymediainfo library to extract media file information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the media filename from command-line arguments (sys.argv[1]).",
  "sinks": "The code processes the filename by passing it to MediaInfo.parse(), which reads the media file.",
  "flows": "Input filename from command-line -> MediaInfo.parse() -> processes media file -> outputs media track info and duration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of standard library and open-source pymediainfo library. No unusual or obfuscated code. No external network activity or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward media info extractor that takes a filename as input, parses media info using pymediainfo, and prints track data and duration. The code has no code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices. It does not handle untrusted data maliciously nor contains any hidden or malicious logic. The use of third-party library is standard and does not by itself raise suspicion. The flow of data is direct and transparent, with no external communication or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign demonstration script for media info extraction. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
