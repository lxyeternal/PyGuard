  "purpose": "Demonstrates how to call pymediainfo to parse media files and display track information.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1] (media file path provided as command-line argument)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no output is sent to external systems or network destinations",
  "flows": "Input from command-line argument -> MediaInfo.parse() -> output via print and pprint",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated or malicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The script accepts a media file path as input, uses pymediainfo to parse its metadata, and displays the information in a formatted manner. It handles user input with basic argument checking, prints media track info, and shows durations. There are no signs of malicious data handling, external network activity, or suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be a straightforward utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign media information parser with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as a simple, well-structured demonstration of pymediainfo usage.",
