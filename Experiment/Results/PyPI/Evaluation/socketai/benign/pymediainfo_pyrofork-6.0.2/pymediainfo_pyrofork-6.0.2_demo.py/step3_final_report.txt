{
  "purpose": "A media info extraction script that parses media files using pymediainfo and displays track data and duration.",
  "sources": "The filename provided via command-line argument, used by MediaInfo.parse() to read media metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads and prints data without writing or transmitting untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> MediaInfo.parse() -> media tracks -> print output; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of pymediainfo, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured utility that reads a media filename, parses metadata with pymediainfo, and prints track info and duration. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. The code uses standard libraries and has no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the script. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 accounts for potential risks of processing untrusted media files but does not reflect any actual vulnerability or malicious intent in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and poses no malware or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
