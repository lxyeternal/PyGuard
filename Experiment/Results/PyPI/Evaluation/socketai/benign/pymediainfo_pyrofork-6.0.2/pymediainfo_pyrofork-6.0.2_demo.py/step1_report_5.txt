  "purpose": "To analyze media files using the pymediainfo library and display media track information.",
  "sources": "Input media filename provided via command line argument (sys.argv[1]).",
  "sinks": "MediaInfo.parse(fname) processes the file; print statements output data; pprint displays track data.",
  "flows": "User supplies filename -> process() calls MediaInfo.parse() -> tracks are iterated and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads a media file path from command-line arguments and uses the pymediainfo library to parse media information. It then prints the data in a formatted manner. The process involves reading input from the user, processing it via a trusted library, and displaying output. There are no suspicious data flows, code injection points, or malicious activities. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple media info extractor utilizing a reputable third-party library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard operations with no indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious payloads.",
