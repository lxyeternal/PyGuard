{
  "purpose": "The script demonstrates how to call pymediainfo to extract media information from a given media file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the media file path from command line arguments (sys.argv[1]) and uses pymediainfo.parse() to process the file.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the call to MediaInfo.parse(fname), which processes the input media file; the output is printed to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input file path from command line -> MediaInfo.parse() processes the file -> output data is printed via pprint and print_frame functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, and no obfuscated code. The code simply processes media info without performing network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code securely takes a filename argument and passes it to pymediainfo.parse(), which is a standard library call. There are no visible indications of malicious behavior such as network access beyond local file processing, code injection, or data leakage. The process is straightforward, focusing solely on media info extraction and display. The code does not contain suspicious imports or functions, nor does it handle untrusted data beyond the media file name. No backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign demo script for extracting media information. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behaviors. It reads a media file path from the command line, processes it using a legitimate library, and prints information. No security issues or malware are detected.",
