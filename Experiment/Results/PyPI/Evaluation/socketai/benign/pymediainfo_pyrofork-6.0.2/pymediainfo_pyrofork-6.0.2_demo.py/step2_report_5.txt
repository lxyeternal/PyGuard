  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The script reads a media filename from command-line arguments.\n- It uses `pymediainfo` to parse media file metadata.\n- It prints track information and duration.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- No network activity, data leakage, or malicious logic is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code functions as intended, with no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Malicious behavior?**  \n  No. The code does not perform network calls, write to external systems, or execute obfuscated/malicious code.\n\n- **Anomalies?**  \n  None. The code is standard and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the script is a benign media info extractor.\n- They mention the code's straightforward nature, lack of suspicious patterns, and proper handling of inputs.\n- They assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores mostly at 0 or 0.1.\n- Confidence is high (1) in all.\n\n**Critical observations:**\n- The only slight concern in some reports is the `securityRisk` score of 0.1, which is very low and likely reflects minimal risk due to reading potentially untrusted media files, but not due to code itself.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The reasoning is sound, with no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Justifications for scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0 or 0.1 — Minimal risk, mainly due to processing untrusted media files, but no active security issues.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n- The scores seem appropriate given the evidence.\n- The slight security risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, acknowledging that processing untrusted media could pose risks outside the scope of this code (e.g., media file exploits), but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect potential issues with untrusted media, but not due to code maliciousness)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, well-structured media info extractor with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the actual code analysis.",
