{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to use the pymediainfo library to parse media files and display metadata information.",
  "sources": "Input filename received from command line argument (sys.argv[1])",
  "sinks": "Parsing the media file with MediaInfo.parse(fname) potentially reads untrusted media files; no direct data leakage or network sinks are present",
  "flows": "Command line input -> media file parsing -> media info extraction and display; no data is sent externally or written to system beyond local display",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and well-structured",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and pymediainfo, takes a media filename as input, parses it, and displays metadata. No network activity, no handling of sensitive information, and no unsafe code practices are present. The media file input could be malicious, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions or malicious data processing. The code only reads and displays metadata locally.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign demonstration of using pymediainfo to extract media metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. It appears safe for use.",
