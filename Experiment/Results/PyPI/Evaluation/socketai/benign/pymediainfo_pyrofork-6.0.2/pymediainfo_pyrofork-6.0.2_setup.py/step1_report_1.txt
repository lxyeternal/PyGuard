{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package 'pymediainfo-pyrofork', intended to build, package, and distribute the library, including handling platform-specific wheel creation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README file, checks for the existence of a license HTML file, and conditionally includes DLL and media info files; also imports from setuptools and wheel for packaging.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks, network communications, or code execution based on untrusted inputs; no sensitive data is handled or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading files ('README.rst', 'docs/License.html') into variables; conditional inclusion of files based on file existence; configuration of build commands and packaging metadata without untrusted data influence.",
  "anomalies": "The code conditionally extends packaging commands but does not perform any suspicious or unusual operations beyond standard package setup. No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens are present. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading a README file, conditionally including documentation and media files, and customizing build commands via 'bdist_wheel' subclassing if the wheel module is available. The try-except block safely handles missing optional dependencies. No malicious or suspicious code, such as network communication, code injection, or credential handling, is present. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured setup script with no anomalies or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appropriately manages optional dependencies and package data without exposing sensitive information or executing untrusted code.",
