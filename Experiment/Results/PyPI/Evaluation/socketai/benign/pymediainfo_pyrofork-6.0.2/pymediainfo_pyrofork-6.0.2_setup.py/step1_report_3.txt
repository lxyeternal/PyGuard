  "purpose": "Set up configuration and packaging details for the 'pymediainfo-pyrofork' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description, checking existence of 'docs/License.html', importing 'wheel.bdist_wheel' if available.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data outputs or unsafe data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading local files for package metadata and conditional import of wheel extension for building platform-specific wheels.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of 'wheel.bdist_wheel' and overriding its methods to force platform-specific wheel tagging are somewhat unusual but common in customized build scripts. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup, including conditional logic for building platform-specific wheels and including license and binary data files. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling occurs. No obfuscated code, code injection, or suspicious behavior detected. It adheres to standard Python packaging practices. No anomalies related to malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration and build customization. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
