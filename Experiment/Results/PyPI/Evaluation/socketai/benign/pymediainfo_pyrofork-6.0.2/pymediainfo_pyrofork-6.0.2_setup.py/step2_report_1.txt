  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- The code performs typical tasks: reading files, conditional inclusion of files, customizing build commands, and setting package metadata.\n- No untrusted data inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The only notable \"anomaly\" is the conditional subclassing of `bdist_wheel` to mark wheels as platform-specific, which is a common practice in packaging for non-pure Python packages.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:**  \n   All reports confirm no malicious code, backdoors, or secret tokens are present.\n\n2. **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns:**  \n   None detected; the code is straightforward.\n\n3. **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not rely on assumptions; they analyze the code's actual operations.\n\n4. **Scores assigned:**  \n   All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard packaging script with no security issues.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The conditional subclassing of `bdist_wheel` is a common technique to ensure platform-specific wheels, not malicious.\n- File checks (`os.path.exists`) are safe and standard.\n- No dynamic code execution or external data handling occurs.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup script is typical and safe. No adjustments needed.",
