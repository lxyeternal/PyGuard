  "purpose": "A setup script for packaging the 'pymediainfo-pyrofork' Python library, handling file inclusion, custom wheel build behavior, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long description, checks for 'docs/License.html', and conditionally includes license and media files; imports 'setuptools' and 'wheel' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution; local file operations only.",
  "flows": "File existence checks and file reads lead to package data configuration; subclassing 'bdist_wheel' customizes wheel metadata without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional subclassing of 'bdist_wheel' to mark wheels as platform-specific is a common packaging pattern, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: reading files, conditionally including data, and customizing build commands. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure code is present. The use of try-except for optional dependencies and file existence checks are safe practices. The overall structure and operations are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and reports align in indicating a safe and straightforward implementation.",
