{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'pymediainfo-pyrofork'. It manages dependencies, package data, and build options for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long description, checking existence of license file, importing setuptools and wheel modules, and user-defined variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, network, or sensitive data. Setup process primarily involves local file operations and package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reading README -> Checking files -> Configuring build options -> Executing setup() with package info and options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden behaviors, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard setup tools and benign file checks. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package. It reads a README file, conditionally includes license and DLL files, customizes wheel building to mark the package as platform-specific, and calls setup() with package metadata and options. All operations are standard for Python packaging. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script with standard packaging procedures. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks detected.",
