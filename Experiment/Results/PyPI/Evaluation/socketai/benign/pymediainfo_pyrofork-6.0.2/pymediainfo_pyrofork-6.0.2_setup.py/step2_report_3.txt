  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup configuration for 'pymediainfo-pyrofork', reading README, checking license file, and optional wheel extension.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity; straightforward file reads and package setup.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior. The use of try-except for optional dependencies is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, standard setup script, high confidence, malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. No issues found. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; correctly notes the setup process and conditional inclusion.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or dynamic code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The dynamic subclassing of `bdist_wheel` is common in customized builds; no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate assessment; no malware or security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned, appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script's role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data, no network or sensitive data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The conditional import and method override for wheel building are standard practices for platform-specific wheels.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, consistent with code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the setup process.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard setup code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate, no risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others; correctly identifies the setup nature.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code's operations are typical for packaging scripts, including conditional file inclusion and customizing wheel builds.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct assessment; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Analysis:** The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package. It reads files for metadata, conditionally includes data files, and customizes wheel building for platform-specific packages. All operations are static and controlled, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated are appropriate.\n- **Security Risks:** No evident security risks; the setup script is benign.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n- **Potential for Higher Risk:** Only if the code included dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling would the risk scores be higher. None are present here.\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security concerns)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure to review new or modified setup scripts for any dynamic code execution or network activity, but this particular code is benign.",
