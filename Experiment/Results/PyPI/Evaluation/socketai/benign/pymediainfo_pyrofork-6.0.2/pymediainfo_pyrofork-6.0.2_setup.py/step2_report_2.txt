  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup configuration for 'pymediainfo-pyrofork'. The code reads 'README.rst' and checks for 'docs/License.html'—accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network operations, only file reads and configuration. Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious operations; standard practices used.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states no malicious behavior, which aligns with the code. The custom wheel class is a common pattern for platform-specific wheels.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** The dynamic class definition for 'bdist_wheel' is standard for customizing wheel tags.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; the code customizes wheel metadata, which is common.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** The conditional import and method override are typical for customizing build behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious behavior; standard setup script.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Usage of 'os.path.exists' and conditional logic are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; the script performs expected packaging tasks.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid; safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data, no network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** The custom wheel class is a typical pattern for marking platform-specific wheels.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the code's operations.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package. It reads files, conditionally includes data, and customizes build commands—all typical tasks. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup script is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are thorough and accurate.",
