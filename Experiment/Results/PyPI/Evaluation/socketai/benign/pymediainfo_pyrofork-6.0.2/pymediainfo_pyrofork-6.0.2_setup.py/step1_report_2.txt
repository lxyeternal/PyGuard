{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library 'pymediainfo-pyrofork'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long description, checks existence of a license HTML file, and conditionally modifies build commands.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations; setup parameters are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "Reads external files for metadata, conditionally extends build commands, and passes configuration to setuptools without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of 'wheel.bdist_wheel' and dynamic class definition are standard practices; no unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or code injections present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup configuration with conditional extensions based on environment. It reads a README file for description and checks for the existence of a license file before adding data files. It conditionally defines a custom wheel build class. No untrusted input processing or dynamic code execution that could be malicious. All operations are related to package setup, and no malicious behaviors or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It correctly handles conditional dependencies and file inclusion. Overall, it appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
