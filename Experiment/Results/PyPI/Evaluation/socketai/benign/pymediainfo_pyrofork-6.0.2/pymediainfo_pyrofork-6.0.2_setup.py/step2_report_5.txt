  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code reads 'README.rst', checks for 'docs/License.html', and conditionally includes DLL/media files. It imports 'setuptools' and 'wheel' modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity; file operations are local and controlled.\n- **Anomalies:** The conditional subclassing of 'bdist_wheel' is standard for customizing wheel builds.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code performs typical package setup tasks with no malicious behavior. The report's confidence is high, and the malware/security risk scores are 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; reads README, checks for license, modifies build commands.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of conditional import and class extension is common in setup scripts.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no secrets. The assessment is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; reads README, license, imports wheel, modifies build.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network operations.\n- **Anomalies:** The custom 'bdist_wheel' subclass is somewhat unusual but standard in certain packaging contexts.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. The report's high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup with license and media files, custom wheel class.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of custom wheel class is common for platform-specific wheels.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or obfuscation; standard packaging code.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reads README, license, manages package data, and customizes wheel build.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network operations.\n- **Anomalies:** The custom wheel class is typical for non-pure Python packages.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code does not exhibit any malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate.",
