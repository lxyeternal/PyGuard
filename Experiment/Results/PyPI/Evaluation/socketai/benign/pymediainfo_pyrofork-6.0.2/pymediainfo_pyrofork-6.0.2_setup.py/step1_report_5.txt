{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'pymediainfo-pyrofork', used to configure package metadata and build options for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long description; checks for existence of 'docs/License.html'; imports modules; uses environment variables indirectly via 'os.path.exists'; gathers package files and optional wheel build class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; setup process handles static metadata and package data without processing user input or external data.",
  "flows": "Reads file system for license file; conditionally adds data files; optionally defines a custom build class; executes setup with static and derived configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code follows standard Python packaging conventions without obfuscation or malicious flow.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for packaging a Python module, including conditional inclusion of license and media info files. It defines a custom wheel distribution class to mark wheels as platform-specific, which is typical for non-pure Python packages. The import statements, file checks, and setup configurations are all standard and do not exhibit malicious intent. No data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or obfuscation patterns are present. All actions are confined to package setup and metadata management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly handles package configuration and data inclusion without performing any unsafe or malicious operations.",
