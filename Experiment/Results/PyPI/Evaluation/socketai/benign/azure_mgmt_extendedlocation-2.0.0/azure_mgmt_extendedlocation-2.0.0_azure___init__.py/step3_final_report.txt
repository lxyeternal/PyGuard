  "purpose": "Namespace extension for supporting Python namespace packages.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' via __import__ and access to __path__, __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data, connect externally, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call 'extend_path' -> modify '__path__' variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for namespace packages, straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends '__path__' for namespace support, a common and benign pattern in Python packaging. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. All reports correctly identify this as a standard, safe practice. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for namespace extension with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and their scoring is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
