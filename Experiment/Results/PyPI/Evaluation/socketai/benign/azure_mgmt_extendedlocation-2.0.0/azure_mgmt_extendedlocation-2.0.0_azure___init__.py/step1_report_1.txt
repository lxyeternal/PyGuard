  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path to include sub-packages, facilitating package namespace management.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' module and use of '__import__' to dynamically load 'pkgutil'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call 'extend_path' -> modify '__path__' for package namespace extension.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs a standard namespace extension without any obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses its 'extend_path' function to extend the module's search path for package resolution. This is a common pattern in namespace package management. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The usage of '__import__' is standard for dynamic imports, and the function serves a typical purpose in package management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package extension pattern without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not introduce security risks beyond typical package management practices.",
