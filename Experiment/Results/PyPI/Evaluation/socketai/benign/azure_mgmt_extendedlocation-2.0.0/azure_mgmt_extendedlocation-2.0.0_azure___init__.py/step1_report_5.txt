  "purpose": "Extend the current module's search path to include additional locations for package discovery.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' to modify '__path__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only modifies the module search path.",
  "flows": "Imports 'pkgutil', calls 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__' to modify module search paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a standard package extension operation without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends '__path__' for a package, which is a common technique to support namespace packages or add additional locations for package data. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and aligns with typical package management patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard practice in Python package namespace extension and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior.",
