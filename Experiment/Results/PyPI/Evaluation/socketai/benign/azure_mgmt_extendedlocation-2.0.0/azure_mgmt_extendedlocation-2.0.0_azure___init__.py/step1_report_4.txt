  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for namespace packages using pkgutil",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' on '__path__' and '__name__'",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is used or output",
  "flows": "The code modifies '__path__' for package namespace extension without external input",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for namespace packages; no unusual behavior or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends the module's search path, which is a common practice for namespace packages in Python. There are no sources of untrusted data, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior. The code's simplicity and use of standard library functions indicate normal behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages and does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues.",
