  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support using pkgutil",
  "sources": "The __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__) call",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only modifies __path__",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module dynamically and calls extend_path() to support namespace packages by extending __path__ with additional locations. This is a common pattern in Python for namespace package management. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. It does not read input, write output, or interact with external systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for supporting namespace packages in Python. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The code is simple and intentionally designed for package structure management.",
