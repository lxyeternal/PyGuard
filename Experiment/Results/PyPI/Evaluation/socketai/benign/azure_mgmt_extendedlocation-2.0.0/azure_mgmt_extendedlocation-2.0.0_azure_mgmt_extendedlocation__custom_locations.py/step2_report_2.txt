  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a Python class for Azure SDK client interaction with the CustomLocations API.\n- The code is auto-generated, uses standard Azure SDK patterns, and involves typical request handling, serialization, and policy management.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are mentioned.\n- The request copying, URL formatting, and network request flow follow standard, safe practices.\n- The scores assigned to malware are all zero, and the security risk scores are very low (~0.1), indicating minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code appears to be well-structured, following Azure SDK conventions, with no evident errors or security flaws.\n\n- **Scores evaluation:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis. The security risk scores are low (~0.1), reflecting standard SDK code with no apparent vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Justification for high risk scores (>0.5)?**  \n  None of the reports justify a risk higher than 0.5. Given the thorough analysis and the nature of the code, such high scores would be unjustified.\n\n- **Malware scores and malicious activity?**  \n  All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their conclusions on observed code structure, standard practices, and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (~0.1), consistent with the code being a standard SDK client.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, auto-generated SDK code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, standard SDK code with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a typical, auto-generated Azure SDK client implementation with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores reflect this assessment correctly.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; the code is safe, and the scoring aligns with the detailed analysis.",
