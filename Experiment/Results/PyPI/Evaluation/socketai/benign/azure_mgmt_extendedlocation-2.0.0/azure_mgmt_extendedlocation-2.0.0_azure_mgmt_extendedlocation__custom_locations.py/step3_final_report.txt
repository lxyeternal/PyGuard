{
  "purpose": "The code defines an Azure SDK client class for managing CustomLocations resources, handling configuration, policies, serialization, and network requests in a standard, auto-generated manner.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as credential, subscription_id, and optional kwargs; internal policies and configuration objects; network request construction and URL formatting.",
  "sinks": "Network request dispatch via self._client.send_request, with request copying and URL formatting; no untrusted data directly influencing request payloads or URLs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> configuration and policies -> request serialization -> request copying and URL formatting -> network request via send_request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors; use of standard SDK patterns; no dynamic code execution or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, auto-generated Azure SDK client class that manages network requests through a chain of policies, serializes requests, and handles responses. It employs standard practices such as deepcopy for request safety and URL formatting to prevent injection. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's structure and behavior, reflecting minimal inherent security risk typical of SDK components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated Azure SDK client with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score appropriately reflects the minimal inherent risk, and the malware score remains zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat in the supply chain context.",
