  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward SDK setup script with import statements, versioning, and patching. No data flow from untrusted sources, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The score of malware=0 and risk=0 is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard SDK initialization with safe handling of optional patches. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected. The malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The scores are consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The only concern raised is the use of a wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`), which can be risky. However, it's wrapped in a try-except block, mitigating the risk. No other suspicious activity or data leaks are identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 (slightly elevated due to wildcard import concern), obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification:** The wildcard import, while generally discouraged, is handled safely here. No malicious behavior is present.\n- **Verdict:** The overall risk score could be slightly increased from 0 to around 0.2 due to the import style concern, but not significantly. Malware remains 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, standard SDK setup with safe import handling, no external data, or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard SDK initialization with no malicious activity or data leaks. The patching mechanism is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0, with Report 3 assigning 0.2 due to the wildcard import. This is reasonable, but perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is benign; no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The only minor concern is the wildcard import, which is handled safely here but could be flagged for best practices. If stricter standards are desired, the risk score could be increased slightly to 0.2.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to the wildcard import, but not enough to be significant)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard SDK boilerplate, with no security issues or malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate, with a slight adjustment for the import style if desired.",
