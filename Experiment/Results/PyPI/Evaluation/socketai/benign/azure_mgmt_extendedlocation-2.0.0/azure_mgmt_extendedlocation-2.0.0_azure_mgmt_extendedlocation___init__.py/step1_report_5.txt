{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a generated SDK for Microsoft services, setting up module imports, versioning, and patching mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_custom_locations, _version, _patch). No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks. The code primarily manages imports and module initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; standard SDK module setup. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly boilerplate for an SDK, importing modules, setting version, and applying patches if available. The try-except block gracefully handles missing patch modules. The __all__ list manages public API exposure. The _patch_sdk() call likely applies runtime modifications but is standard for SDK patching mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical generated SDK setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. It appears safe and purposeful for SDK initialization.",
