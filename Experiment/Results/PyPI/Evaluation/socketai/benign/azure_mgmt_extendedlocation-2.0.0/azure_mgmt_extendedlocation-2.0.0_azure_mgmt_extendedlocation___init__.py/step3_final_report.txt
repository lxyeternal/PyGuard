  "purpose": "SDK initialization and module import setup for the package, including versioning and patch application.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version assignment, optional patch import within try-except.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Importing modules and applying patches; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`) which can be risky but is safely enclosed in try-except.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated SDK setup script that imports modules, sets version info, and applies optional patches. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The wildcard import is a known risk but is handled safely with try-except, mitigating potential issues. No obfuscation or secrets are detected. The code is straightforward and typical for SDK initialization, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate generated by a tool, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor concern about the wildcard import is mitigated by safe handling, and overall, the code poses no security risk.",
