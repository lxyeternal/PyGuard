  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SDK setup script with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious patterns, data leaks, or obfuscation detected. The code is typical for SDK initialization.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard SDK setup with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Also standard SDK boilerplate code. Slight concern about the wildcard import, but it's safely handled.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (slightly higher due to wildcard import, but justified)\n- **Comments:** The risk score is slightly elevated due to the wildcard import, but the try-except block mitigates potential issues. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Typical SDK initialization code, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Comments:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard boilerplate for SDK setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code is purely import/setup routines with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports indicate no obfuscation, which is correct given the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** The highest risk score is 0.2, justified by the wildcard import in Report 3. Given the context, this is a minimal concern, not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code appears benign, standard SDK boilerplate generated by a tool.\n- The wildcard import, while potentially risky in other contexts, is safely enclosed in a try-except block, reducing concern.\n- No evidence of data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, primarily due to the wildcard import, but it's handled safely)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores provided are reasonable and align with the analysis.",
