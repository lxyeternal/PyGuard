{
  "purpose": "The code sets up module imports, versioning, and patching for a Python SDK, primarily configuring the module's public API and importing optional patches.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (_custom_locations, _version, _patch) and the VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly handles module setup and import logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code comments and structure indicate standard SDK initialization.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version and patch modules, assigns the version, conditionally imports patch functions, and extends the public API list with patches if available. The code appears to be standard SDK boilerplate with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The try-except block safely handles missing optional patches without exposing any vulnerabilities or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical SDK initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and designed to prepare the SDK for use and optional patching.",
