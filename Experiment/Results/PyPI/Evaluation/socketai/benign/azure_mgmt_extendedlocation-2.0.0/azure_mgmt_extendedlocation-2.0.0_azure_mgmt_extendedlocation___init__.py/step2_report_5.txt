  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SDK setup script with import statements, version setting, optional patch import, and a call to `_patch_sdk()`.\n- **Findings:** No data flows from untrusted sources, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity, or malicious patterns.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code appears benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing module setup, optional patch import, and versioning.\n- **Findings:** No data leaks or malicious behavior, standard boilerplate.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Also describes SDK initialization, with a note on the wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`).\n- **Findings:** The wildcard import is potentially risky but is handled safely within a try-except block. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — a slight concern due to the wildcard import, but overall the code is safe.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The minor risk score reflects the potential danger of wildcard imports, but since it's handled safely, the overall risk remains low.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard SDK setup, no external input, no suspicious code.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no external data handling.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Boilerplate SDK code, with import statements, versioning, and patching.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear and generated, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0, with one report (Report 3) assigning 0.2 due to the wildcard import. Given that the wildcard import is within a try-except block and the code performs no other risky operations, this is reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical auto-generated SDK initialization script.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no external input, no network activity, no cryptography, no secrets.\n- The wildcard import, while potentially risky, is safely handled, and the code's overall behavior is benign.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a minimal concern due to the wildcard import, but overall very safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign SDK boilerplate with no security issues. The risk score could be slightly increased from 0 to 0.1 to reflect the wildcard import, but it's not necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No further action is needed.",
