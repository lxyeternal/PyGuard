{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures a Python package, importing specific modules, handling optional patch imports, and setting version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'VERSION' from an internal module, and optionally imports '_patch' components if available.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output points are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, setting the version, and conditionally importing patch components, then calling '_patch_sdk()'.",
  "anomalies": "The use of wildcard import ('from ._patch import *') can be risky, but is wrapped in a try-except block to prevent import errors. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be boilerplate setup code generated by a code generator. It imports internal modules, manages optional patching, and sets module exports. The wildcard import is potentially risky but is safely handled with a try-except block. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The code's structure and behavior are typical for SDK setup code, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard SDK setup boilerplate with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is the wildcard import, but it is safely enclosed in a try-except block. Overall, the code appears safe.",
