{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated Python module for a SDK, setting up imports, versioning, and patching mechanisms for a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_custom_locations, _version, _patch), and the VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is processed from untrusted sources, nor are there output sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs import and setup routines.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior detected. The code appears standard for SDK initialization and patching.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various local modules, sets versioning, and performs conditional import of patch functions with fallback. The final call to _patch_sdk() executes a function from an imported module, likely to modify SDK behavior. No user input, network activity, or cryptographic operations are present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical auto-generated SDK setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It performs standard import and patching routines without any suspicious activity.",
