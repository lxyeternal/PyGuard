{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable sanitization for testing purposes, specifically masking sensitive Azure credentials and cookies in test recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), headers, and response bodies during testing.",
  "sinks": "Sanitization functions that replace sensitive data in logs or recordings to prevent leaks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are retrieved and passed to sanitization functions which then mask these values in logs and responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; the code properly sanitizes sensitive data during testing. No hardcoded secrets beyond placeholders, no obfuscated code, no malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables related to Azure credentials, then applies regex sanitizers to mask these values in test recordings, headers, and response bodies. All data handling is confined to sanitization for testing purposes. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious code detected. Usage aligns with standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs sanitization of sensitive environment variables and headers in test recordings, which is a standard security practice. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware. The code appears safe and intended for protecting sensitive data during testing.",
