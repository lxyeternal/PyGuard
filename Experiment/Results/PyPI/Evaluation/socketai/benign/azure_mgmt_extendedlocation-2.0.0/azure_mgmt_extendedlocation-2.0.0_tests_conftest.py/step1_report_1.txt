{
  "purpose": "The code sets up test environment sanitizers to anonymize sensitive information in test recordings, specifically for Azure credentials and tokens.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for Azure credentials (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET).",
  "sinks": "Uses sanitizers to replace sensitive data in logs, recordings, and HTTP headers or bodies.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and then sanitized in test recordings; sanitizers replace real credentials with placeholders in logs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; standard sanitization procedures for test environments. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables related to Azure credentials, then applies regex-based sanitization to mask these secrets in test recordings and logs. It also sanitizes headers and specific JSON keys such as 'access_token'. The code adheres to standard testing practices, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is designed solely for data sanitization during testing, and no data exfiltration or malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing utility for sanitizing sensitive information in logs and recordings. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The purpose is to protect credentials during testing, and the implementation is appropriate and safe.",
