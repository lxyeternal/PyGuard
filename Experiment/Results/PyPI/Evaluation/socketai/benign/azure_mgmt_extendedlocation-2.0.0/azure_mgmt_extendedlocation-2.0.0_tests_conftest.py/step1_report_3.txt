{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable sanitization for testing purposes, specifically sanitizing sensitive Azure credentials and HTTP headers in test recordings.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for Azure credentials and secrets, including AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET.",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers apply replacements to regex matches in recordings, sanitizing sensitive data like subscription IDs, tenant IDs, client IDs, secrets, cookies, and access tokens.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources, then sanitizers modify data in test recordings to prevent sensitive info leaks, acting as sinks for the sanitized data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected; code appears standard for sanitizing test recordings with no hardcoded secrets or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables containing potentially sensitive Azure credentials. It uses sanitizers to replace these values in test recordings with dummy placeholders, preventing sensitive data leaks during test runs. The sanitizers also mask cookie headers and access tokens in HTTP interactions. All actions are related to test data sanitization and do not involve malicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard security measure for sanitizing sensitive data in testing environments. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to protect sensitive information during automated testing.",
