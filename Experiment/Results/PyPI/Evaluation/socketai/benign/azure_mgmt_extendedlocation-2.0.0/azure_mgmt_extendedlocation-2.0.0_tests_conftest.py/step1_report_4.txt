{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up environment sanitizers to mask sensitive information in test recordings, specifically for Azure credentials and cookies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET); headers and response body in test recordings.",
  "sinks": "Sanitized output in test logs or recordings to prevent sensitive data leakage.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used to populate sanitizers, which then mask sensitive data in logs, headers, and response bodies.",
  "anomalies": "The code stores sensitive credentials in environment variables and applies sanitizers to mask them, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are observed; the code is configuration for testing sanitation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and sets up environment variable loading. It then defines a fixture that adds sanitizers to mask environment variables and HTTP headers or response data containing sensitive information. The sanitizers replace actual sensitive values with a placeholder. There are no malicious functions, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code's purpose is to prevent sensitive data exposure during test recordings. The overall structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard security measure for testing environments to mask sensitive credentials and cookies. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
