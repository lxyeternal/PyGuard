{
  "purpose": "The code loads environment variables containing Azure credentials and applies regex sanitizers to mask these credentials, cookies, and access tokens in test recordings, logs, headers, and response bodies to prevent sensitive data leakage during testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), HTTP headers ('Set-Cookie', 'Cookie'), JSON key ('$..access_token')",
  "sinks": "Sanitized outputs in logs, recordings, headers, and response bodies where sensitive data could be exposed",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read, then regex sanitizers replace their values in logs and HTTP data during testing",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder values ('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000') for environment variables, which is standard in test setups; no suspicious or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup for sanitizing sensitive environment variables and HTTP data during testing. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic. All reports correctly identify its purpose and find no malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate. The slight elevation in risk score (around 0.1-0.2) due to placeholder values is justified given the context. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code aligns with best practices for test hygiene.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe sanitization utility used in testing environments to prevent data leaks. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
