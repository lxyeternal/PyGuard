{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load environment variables and add sanitizers to obfuscate sensitive information in test recordings to prevent exposure of credentials and session tokens.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), which are used as input data for sanitization",
  "sinks": "Sanitizer functions that modify or mask sensitive data in recordings, headers, and JSON bodies; no direct data leaks or malicious output sinks present",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and passed to sanitizers; sanitized data is used in testing fixtures to prevent sensitive info from being recorded or exposed",
  "anomalies": "Use of default placeholder values for critical credentials (all set to zeroed UUIDs), but this appears intentional for testing sanitization rather than malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables related to Azure credentials and applies regex sanitizers to mask these values in test recordings. The sanitizers replace actual sensitive data with placeholder strings. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward and focused on security hygiene, specifically sanitizing sensitive info in testing contexts. There are no suspicious external calls, obfuscated logic, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and intended for security hygiene in testing environments. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, but it handles sensitive information sanitization responsibly. The use of placeholder values suggests a focus on preventing accidental exposure of real credentials in test logs.",
