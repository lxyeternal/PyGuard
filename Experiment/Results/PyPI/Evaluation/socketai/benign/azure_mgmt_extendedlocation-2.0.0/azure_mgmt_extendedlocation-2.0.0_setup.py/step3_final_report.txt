  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python library, reading version info from local files, and collecting documentation for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from version.py or _version.py files, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs processed; static file reads and data passed to setuptools.setup().",
  "flows": "Reads version and documentation files, then calls setup() with collected data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; regex for version extraction is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks with static file reads and regex extraction. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present. The regex used for version extraction is straightforward and typical. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior is observed. The code is consistent with a benign setup script intended for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
