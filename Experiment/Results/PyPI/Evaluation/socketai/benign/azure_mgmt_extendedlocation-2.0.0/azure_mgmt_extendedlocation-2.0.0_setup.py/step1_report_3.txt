{
  "purpose": "This script is used to configure and setup the packaging for the 'azure-mgmt-extendedlocation' Python library, including version extraction, metadata definition, and dependency specification.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from version.py or _version.py, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description, and imports standard modules like os, re, and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the script primarily reads static files and sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads version information from files -> uses regex to extract version -> passes version and other metadata to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; straightforward package setup script with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version data from specific files within the package directory, extracting the version string with a regex. It then reads markdown files for description content and configures package metadata with setuptools. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are used. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or cryptic obfuscation. The code appears to be a standard setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It safely reads static files and sets package metadata. No malware or security risks identified.",
