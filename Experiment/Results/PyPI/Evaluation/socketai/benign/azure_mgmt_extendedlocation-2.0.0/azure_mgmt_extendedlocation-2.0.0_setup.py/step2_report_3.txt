  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- It reads version info from local files, reads documentation files, and calls `setuptools.setup()` with static data.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing is present.\n- The regex for version extraction is straightforward.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:** Confirms the code is a standard setup script, safe, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (low, due to minimal risk in file handling, acceptable)\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup operations, safe, no suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (acceptable)\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:** Also confirms standard setup, no malicious activity, straightforward code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:** Again, standard package setup, no suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a typical setup.py script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The minimal security risk score (0.1) is appropriate, considering the script reads local files and performs package configuration.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to minimal file handling, no external inputs, and standard practices)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. The reports are consistent with my analysis.",
