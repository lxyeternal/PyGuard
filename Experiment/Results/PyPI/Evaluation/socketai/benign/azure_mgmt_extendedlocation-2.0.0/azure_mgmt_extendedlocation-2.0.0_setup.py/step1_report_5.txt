{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, specifically for building and distributing the 'azure-mgmt-extendedlocation' SDK.",
  "sources": "File reads for version.py or _version.py, README.md, CHANGELOG.md",
  "sinks": "None observed that directly lead to data leaks or security issues; mainly standard file I/O and package setup functions",
  "flows": "Reading version info from version files -> Setting package metadata -> Invoking setup() with package details",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The version extraction uses regex but appears standard. No obfuscated code or malicious obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads version information from local files, reads documentation files, and then calls setuptools.setup() to prepare the package for distribution. All file reads seem standard, with no external input influencing the process. The regex used for version extraction is straightforward. No network activity, no use of untrusted data, and no malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It only performs package configuration and metadata collection, which are typical operations for package distribution. No suspicious behaviors or malware indicators are detected.",
