  "purpose": "Define a version constant for the package or module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths detected, as the code only assigns a constant string.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; no unusual code patterns or hidden behavior. The comment about code generation suggests automated process but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version assignment with licensing and generated code notices. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communication functions. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The licensing comments and auto-generation note are typical in SDK or API client code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple version declaration with licensing comments, showing no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
