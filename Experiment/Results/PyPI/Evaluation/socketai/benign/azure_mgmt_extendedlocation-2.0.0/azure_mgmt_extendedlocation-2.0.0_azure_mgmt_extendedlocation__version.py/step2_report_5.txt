  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions are justified, whether the scores align with the evidence, and if any adjustments are necessary.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a very simple code snippet: a comment block followed by a version string assignment.\n- No input/output, data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated, which is common in SDKs or API client libraries.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Findings:** No issues detected; code is a simple version constant with licensing comments.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully justified. No change needed.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Findings:** Same as above; a straightforward version declaration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully justified. No change needed.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Findings:** Similar, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still justified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The slightly lower confidence is acceptable given the minimal code complexity.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Findings:** Same benign assessment; auto-generated version info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct and justified.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Findings:** Same as others; benign, minimal code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n- **Malware score:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** All zero, as there is no security concern.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's content.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- My own estimate aligns with the reports: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0**.\n\n**Summary:** The reports correctly identify this as benign, auto-generated version declaration code with no malicious or security issues. The scoring reflects this accurately.",
