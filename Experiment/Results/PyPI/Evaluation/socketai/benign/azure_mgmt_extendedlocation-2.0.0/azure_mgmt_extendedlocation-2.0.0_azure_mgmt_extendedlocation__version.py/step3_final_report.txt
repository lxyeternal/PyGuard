{
  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a version declaration with licensing comments, likely auto-generated for SDK or API client libraries.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, data, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code is a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single assignment of a version string. It does not perform any input/output, network communication, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, auto-generated boilerplate with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores and analysis are consistent and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
