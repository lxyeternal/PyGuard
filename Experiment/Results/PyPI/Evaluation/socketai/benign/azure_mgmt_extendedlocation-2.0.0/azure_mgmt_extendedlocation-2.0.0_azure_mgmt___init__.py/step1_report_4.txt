{
  "purpose": "Extend the current package's search path using pkgutil to support namespace packages or package extensions.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses __import__ to load it dynamically.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data or output is generated.",
  "flows": "The code flows from dynamic import of 'pkgutil' to calling 'extend_path' with __path__ and __name__.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import and extension of __path__, which is standard in namespace package setups; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and calls 'extend_path' to modify __path__, which is typical for namespace packages that span multiple directories. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is minimal and appears legitimate, serving a common purpose in package management. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for namespace package support in Python, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
