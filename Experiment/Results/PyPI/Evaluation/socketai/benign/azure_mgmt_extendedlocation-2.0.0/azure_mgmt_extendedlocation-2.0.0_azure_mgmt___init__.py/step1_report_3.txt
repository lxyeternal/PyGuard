  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ for package resource loading",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks",
  "flows": "Importing 'pkgutil' and extending __path__ with extend_path method",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; standard package resource handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module dynamically and uses its 'extend_path' function to modify the __path__ variable, which is used to specify package search paths. This is a common pattern in Python packages to support namespace packages, enabling multiple directories to contribute to a single package namespace. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks in this snippet. No user input or untrusted data is involved, and there are no suspicious operations or data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard package namespace extension and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical pattern used in Python packaging for namespace packages.",
