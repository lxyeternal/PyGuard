  "purpose": "Support for namespace package extension by modifying __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' via __import__ and use of extend_path with __path__ and __name__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, untrusted input, or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call extend_path with __path__ and __name__ -> assign to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard namespace package pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' with a string literal, then calls extend_path to modify __path__, which is a common pattern in Python for supporting namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code performs a legitimate package management function. The use of dynamic import here is standard and safe. No data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk near 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern used in Python packaging for namespace support. No malicious intent or security issues are present. The scores are accurate; the minimal security risk score in one report (0.1) can be adjusted to 0 for clarity, but it is acceptable as is.",
