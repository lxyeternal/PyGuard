  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a minimal, benign template for SDK customization.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns are identified.\n- The purpose is solely to provide a hook (`patch_sdk`) for future user modifications.\n- Confidence is high (1) across all reports, with no anomalies or security risks detected.\n\n**Confirming the Code:**\n- The provided code contains only:\n  - Licensing comments.\n  - A module docstring with a URL.\n  - An import statement (`from typing import List`).\n  - An empty list declaration (`__all__`).\n  - A single function `patch_sdk()` with a docstring, but no implementation.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the code is a harmless template with no security issues.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- Risk score: 0, since there's no security risk or vulnerability.\n\n**Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that the code remains a simple template and does not include hidden malicious logic. This is reasonable given the code content.\n- The only point of potential concern would be if this template were exploited to insert malicious code later, but as provided, it is safe.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, minimal SDK customization scaffold.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments.\n- I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a benign, well-structured SDK template with no security concerns. No further action or scrutiny is necessary.",
