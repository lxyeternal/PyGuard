  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n- No external input, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose is to provide a placeholder function (`patch_sdk`) for future user modifications.\n- No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or vulnerabilities:**\n   - The code contains only import statements, a list declaration, a function stub, and comments.\n   - No data flows, sinks, or sources that could lead to data leaks or code injection.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or external data reading.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: the code is benign, minimal, and intended as a template.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of malicious activity or security risks.\n   - The reasoning is sound: static, well-structured boilerplate code with no active logic.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - Malware score: 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - Risk score: 0, reflecting no security concern.\n   \n   These scores seem reasonable and justified based on the code's content.\n\n4. **Potential for higher scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely a template with no malicious or risky elements, elevating the scores would be unjustified.\n   - The only reason to consider a higher score would be if the code had hidden or obfuscated malicious logic, which it does not.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign SDK customization template with no security issues. The reports' evaluations are accurate and reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe, minimal, and intended as a placeholder.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n- No evidence supports raising these scores.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
