{
  "purpose": "A minimal SDK customization template with licensing, documentation, and a placeholder function for user modifications.",
  "sources": "No data inputs, external sources, or dynamic code; only static definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, external calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static code with no runtime data movement or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, boilerplate code with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, static template intended for SDK customization. It contains licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty list declaration, and a placeholder function 'patch_sdk' with documentation. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK scaffold with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports accurately assess its benign nature, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.",
