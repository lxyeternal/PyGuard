{
  "purpose": "This code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, specifically for Microsoft Azure SDKs in Python.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; no user input or external data access present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations; the code is solely defining a function and metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code consists of static definitions and a placeholder function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, well-structured, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard template with a licensing header, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty __all__ list, and a single function 'patch_sdk' with documentation. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or sensitive operations. It appears to be a harmless customization point for SDK code generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template intended for SDK customization. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
