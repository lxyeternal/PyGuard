{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a template for customizing generated SDK code, primarily providing a placeholder function for future modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads only static import statements and comments; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; there are no points where untrusted data could be leaked or executed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code contains only definitions and comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard template with no unusual or suspicious constructs. The only notable feature is the placeholder function `patch_sdk`, which is explicitly documented for customization purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard licensing comments, imports, a list for public objects, and a single placeholder function with an explanatory docstring. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The purpose seems to be to allow future customization, not to perform any active operation. No obfuscation or malware-related elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template intended for future SDK customization. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and appears to be a standard, intentionally minimal scaffold.",
