  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, specifically in a Microsoft Azure SDK context.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present as the code does not process data or execute untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only boilerplate template functions and import statements with no executable logic or malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, well-structured template meant for SDK customization. It includes a licensing notice, a docstring with a URL, an import statement, an empty list declaration, and a function intended for user customizations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The only notable aspect is the placeholder function for SDK modifications, which is standard in SDK templates.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template intended for SDK customization. It contains no malicious code, suspicious patterns, or security risks.",
