  "analysis": "The code is minimal and primarily consists of licensing comments, a docstring, an import statement, and an empty function meant for SDK patching. There are no data input points, no data processing, and no external communication or suspicious behavior observed. The purpose is clearly for SDK customization without any embedded malicious intent or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for SDK customization with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is standard boilerplate code with no evident security concerns.",
