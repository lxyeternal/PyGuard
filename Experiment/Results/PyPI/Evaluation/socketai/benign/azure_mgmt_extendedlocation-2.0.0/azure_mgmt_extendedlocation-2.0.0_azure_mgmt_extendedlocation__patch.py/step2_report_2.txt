  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n- It contains licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty list declaration, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk`.\n- There are no active data flows, input/output operations, or logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose is clearly to serve as a customization hook, not to perform any runtime logic or data processing.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code as a template for SDK customization.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, a scaffold for SDK customization.\n- **Analysis:** No active functionality, no external data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Same, a placeholder for future modifications.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Similar, a template with a hook for SDK customization.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no data flows.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Same as others, a placeholder.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe boilerplate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches all reports' descriptions; no active logic, no external input, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is straightforward and typical for SDK customization points.\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or security risks are evident.\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a safe, standard SDK template with no security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the reports are consistent and correct.",
