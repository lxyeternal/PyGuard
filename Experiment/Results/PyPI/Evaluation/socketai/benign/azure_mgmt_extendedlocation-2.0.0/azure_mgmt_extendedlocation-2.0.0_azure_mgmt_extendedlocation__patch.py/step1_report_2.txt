{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a template or scaffold for customizing generated SDK code, specifically for a Python package, with no active functionality or logic implemented.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any input or external data; it only imports 'List' from 'typing' and defines a function 'patch_sdk'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code where untrusted data could cause vulnerabilities or leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists, as the code contains only definitions and no execution of data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or hidden code are present. The code is straightforward and typical for SDK customization templates.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a minimal template with a license comment, a docstring, an import statement, a list declaration, and an empty function intended for SDK patching. There are no active data inputs, outputs, or operations that could be malicious. The code's purpose is to serve as a placeholder for future customizations, and it contains no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign template file used for customizing SDK behavior with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It contains no code that could harm or compromise systems.",
