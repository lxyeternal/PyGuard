  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - The code is a minimal template with no executable logic, data processing, or external input/output.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - The `patch_sdk()` function is intended as a customization hook, not for executing malicious code.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate for SDK customization, with no signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment, emphasizing the benign and template nature of the code.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows, sources, sinks, or anomalies.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n   - The `patch_sdk()` function is a placeholder for user customization, not for executing code.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are cautious and based on static analysis.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the code is clearly a template.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The reports correctly reflect the benign, template nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless SDK customization scaffold.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.\n\n**Personal Estimation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' assessments.",
