  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the provided code:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a minimal template with licensing info, a docstring pointing to customization guidance, an import statement (`from typing import List`), an empty list `__all__`, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with documentation.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code does not process any data, read external sources, or execute any logic beyond defining a function.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Security Risks**:\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is purely boilerplate for SDK customization, with no active logic or external interactions.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with confidence scores of 1 and malware scores of 0.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Analysis of Reasoning & Logic**:\n   - The reports are consistent, thorough, and accurate.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a harmless template with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond the code's apparent purpose; the conclusions are justified.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - No issues are apparent. The reports are accurate and align with the code's content.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Recommendations**:\n   - The code is a standard, benign SDK customization scaffold.\n   - No modifications to scores are necessary.\n   - The detailed reasoning in the reports supports that this code poses no security risk.\n\n**Final Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action is required.",
