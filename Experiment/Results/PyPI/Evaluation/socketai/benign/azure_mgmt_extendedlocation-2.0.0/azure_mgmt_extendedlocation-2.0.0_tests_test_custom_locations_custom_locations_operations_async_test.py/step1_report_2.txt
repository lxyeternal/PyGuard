{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for Azure SDK management operations related to CustomLocations, used for testing Azure resource management APIs asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Reads resource group names from the test framework, imports modules and classes related to Azure SDK and test utilities.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or system command executions present.",
  "flows": "The test methods invoke SDK client methods which interact with Azure cloud APIs, but no user-controlled or untrusted data is passed directly into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Code appears to be auto-generated and standard for Azure SDK tests.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard Azure SDK modules and test utilities, defines a test class with setup and test methods decorated for asynchronous execution. It creates a management client, then performs API calls to list operations and resource groups, asserting responses. No external input handling, no command execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors are observed. The code is typical for automated SDK testing and is not obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Azure SDK test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious behaviors. The code is safe for use, primarily serving as an automated test for Azure resource management APIs.",
