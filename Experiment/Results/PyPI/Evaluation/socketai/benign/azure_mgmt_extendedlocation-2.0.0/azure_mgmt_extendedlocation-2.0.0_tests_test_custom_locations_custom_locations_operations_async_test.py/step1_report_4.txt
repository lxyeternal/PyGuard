  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for Azure SDK's CustomLocations management client, using pytest and Azure test utilities, to test listing operations at subscription and resource group levels.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pytest', 'azure.mgmt.extendedlocation.aio', and 'devtools_testutils' modules; use of resource group names; responses from Azure management client methods.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on responses; no direct sinks for untrusted data or security-critical operations.",
  "flows": "Calls to Azure SDK methods retrieving resource data flow from Azure API responses into test assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed; code structure is typical for test modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Azure SDK and testing utilities, sets up a test class with async methods to list custom locations, and performs assertions on the responses. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data processing occurs within this code. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code's purpose is standard testing for Azure management APIs, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for Azure SDK's CustomLocations management operations. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code performs typical API calls and assertions with no indication of sabotage or malware.",
