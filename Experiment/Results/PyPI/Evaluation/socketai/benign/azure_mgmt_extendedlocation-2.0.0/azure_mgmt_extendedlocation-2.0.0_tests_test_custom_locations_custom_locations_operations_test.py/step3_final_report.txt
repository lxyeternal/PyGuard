  "purpose": "A test suite for Azure SDK custom locations management, performing API calls and assertions to verify functionality.",
  "sources": "API responses from azure.mgmt.extendedlocation.CustomLocations methods, resource group names from test framework.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or written; responses are handled internally within the test assertions.",
  "flows": "API calls (sources) lead to response handling and assertions without external data leakage or modification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated test suite for Azure SDK operations, utilizing standard libraries and practices. It performs API calls to list operations, by subscription, and by resource group, with assertions to verify responses. No malicious patterns, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is benign, intended for testing SDK functionality. The security implications are minimal, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign test suite for Azure SDK management operations. It shows no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
