{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test suite for Azure Custom Locations management using the Azure SDK, pytest, and recorded test utilities.",
  "sources": "Reads are performed on Azure SDK client methods and resource group data provided by the testing framework.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Test setup retrieves the client, then calls list operations on the Azure SDK client, with resource group data used in method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard testing code for SDK operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and Azure SDK classes to perform management operations on Azure resources. It sets up a test class with methods to list custom locations, using resource group names supplied by the testing framework. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are handled insecurely. The code does not include any network connections outside the SDK's internal mechanisms, nor does it process unvalidated external input. There are no obfuscated or malicious code constructs. The purpose is clearly to verify SDK functionality, not to execute any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for Azure SDK operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows.",
