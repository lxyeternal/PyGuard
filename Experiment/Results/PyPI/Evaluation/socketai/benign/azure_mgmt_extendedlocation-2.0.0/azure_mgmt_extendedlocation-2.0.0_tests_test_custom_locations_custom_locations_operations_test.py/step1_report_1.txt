{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for Azure SDK management of custom locations, intended for automated testing of Azure resource management APIs.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pytest', 'azure.mgmt.extendedlocation', and 'devtools_testutils'; uses resource group names and response objects as data sources.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and response processing; no data sinks or external data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Test methods call Azure SDK methods, process responses, and assert conditions; data flows from API responses to assertions but no untrusted data manipulation or external transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs detected; code appears standard for testing Azure SDK functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a testing environment, invokes Azure management API methods, and asserts expected outcomes. It uses standard libraries, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The use of hardcoded location 'eastus' is typical for testing. No data leaks, credential handling, or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for Azure SDK operations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard API calls and assertions relevant to Azure resource management without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
