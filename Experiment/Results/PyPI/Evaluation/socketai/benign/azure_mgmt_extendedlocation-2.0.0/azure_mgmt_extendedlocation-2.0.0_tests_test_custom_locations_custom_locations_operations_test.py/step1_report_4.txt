{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for Azure Custom Locations management API, using pytest framework and Azure SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries (pytest, azure.mgmt.extendedlocation, devtools_testutils), uses environment variables for resource group names, and calls Azure SDK methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Azure SDK methods which send requests over the network; no data sinks involve untrusted data being stored or executed.",
  "flows": "Test methods initiate SDK calls that send requests to Azure services; no user input or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code is a straightforward unit test with standard structure and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for Azure SDK, importing pytest and Azure management libraries. It sets up a client, runs tests that invoke Azure API endpoints, and asserts responses. No external data inputs are processed directly; the code does not handle or process untrusted data, nor does it include obfuscated or malicious code patterns. No network or system-level malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test suite for Azure resource management. It uses standard libraries and follows typical testing patterns without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
