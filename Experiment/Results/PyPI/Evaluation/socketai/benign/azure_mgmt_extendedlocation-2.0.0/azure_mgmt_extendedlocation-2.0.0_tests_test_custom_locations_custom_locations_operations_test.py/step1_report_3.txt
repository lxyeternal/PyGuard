{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for Azure management SDK, specifically testing operations related to Custom Locations in Azure.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, azure.mgmt.extendedlocation, devtools_testutils; usage of environment variables and resource group names.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is written or used in a way that would lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Test functions call Azure SDK methods, which are external API calls; data flows from these calls into assertions, with no evidence of untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or obfuscated code; all functions seem to perform standard SDK testing routines.",
  "analysis": "The script is a structured test suite using pytest for Azure SDK operations related to custom locations. It uses standard practices such as resource group preparation and recorded proxy for tests. There are no indications of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code does not handle untrusted input in a harmful manner, nor does it contain any suspicious code constructs. Its purpose appears to be legitimate testing of Azure SDK functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate test suite for Azure SDK features with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
