{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for Azure management SDK, specifically testing custom location operations.",
  "sources": "import statements (pytest, azure.mgmt.extendedlocation, devtools_testutils), function parameters (resource_group), response data from API calls.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause leaks; mainly calls to Azure SDK methods and assertions.",
  "flows": "The code reads data from Azure management API responses and verifies responses through assertions; no untrusted data flows or dangerous data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite leveraging Azure SDK and testing utilities. It imports public SDK modules and uses test decorators. The code makes API calls to list operations and resource groups, then asserts on responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate test code with no embedded malicious or maliciously intended instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for Azure SDK operations, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
