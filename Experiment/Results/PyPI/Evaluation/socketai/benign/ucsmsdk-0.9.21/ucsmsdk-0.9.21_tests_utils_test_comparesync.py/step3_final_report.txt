  "purpose": "Unit testing for UCS SDK object comparison and synchronization.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded IP addresses, usernames, passwords, and object attributes within test setup and object creation.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded credentials into object instantiation and comparison functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials ('192.168.1.1', 'admin', 'password') in test code; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for UCS SDK object comparison, with no malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors. The hardcoded credentials are typical for testing environments but pose security risks if exposed outside controlled settings. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code and the security concern of credential management in testing contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign test code used for UCS SDK validation. The only security concern is the use of hardcoded credentials, which should be secured or removed in production environments. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are detected. The scoring accurately reflects the risk profile.",
