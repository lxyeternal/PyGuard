  "sources": "There are no data sources; the code contains only comments with licensing information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no executable code or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is purely a comment block with no runtime or data transfer activities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard license header with no suspicious or unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments with no executable statements, data input, or output. There are no sources, sinks, or flows that could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The comments are standard legal notices, and the code does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. The confidence level is high due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign licensing comment header with no security implications. All reports correctly identify its nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
