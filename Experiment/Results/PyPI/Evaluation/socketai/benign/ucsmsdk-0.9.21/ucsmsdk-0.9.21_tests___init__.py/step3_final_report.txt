  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external communications, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, system commands, file operations, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from sources to sinks via data flows, potentially through dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Potential presence of eval/exec functions, unvalidated inputs, suspicious external communications, lack of code or minimal code.",
  "analysis": "Most reports lack actual code, relying on summaries; where code is suspected (Report 3), unvalidated inputs and dynamic execution are flagged as risks. Scores are generally low, with some suspicion in Report 3. Without concrete code evidence, the likelihood of malicious behavior remains low. The reasoning is consistent across reports, with appropriate confidence levels and scores aligned with the evidence or lack thereof.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign overall, with no confirmed malicious activity. The slight suspicion in Report 3 warrants cautious monitoring but does not justify a high malware score. The assessments are reasonable given the limited code context.",
