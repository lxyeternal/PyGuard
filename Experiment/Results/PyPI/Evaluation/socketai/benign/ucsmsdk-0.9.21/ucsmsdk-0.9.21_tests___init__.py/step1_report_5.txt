  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing, but without specific comments or context, its purpose is unclear. It may be intended for data analysis or communication.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly evident; potential data sources could be external files, environment variables, or network inputs if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or environment modifications if such code exists elsewhere.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are visible in the provided snippet. The code does not demonstrate data movement from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated sections, or unusual code patterns evident. The code structure appears straightforward without hidden dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows standard Python code with no signs of malicious intent. There are no obfuscated parts, suspicious imports, or risky operations like system calls, network communications, or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any dangerous or privacy-intrusive actions. Lack of explicit external input handling limits the assessment, but nothing in the visible code suggests malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code seems benign and performs standard operations without any suspicious or harmful activity.",
