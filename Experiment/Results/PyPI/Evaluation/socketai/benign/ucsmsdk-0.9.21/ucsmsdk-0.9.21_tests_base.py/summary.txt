  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, following standard testing patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only issue is a minor bug in tearDown() that should be fixed. The external functions' safety cannot be confirmed but are likely legitimate based on their naming. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0 and a very low risk score (~0.1)."
