  "purpose": "Define a base unit test class for setting up and tearing down test environments with custom functions.",
  "sources": "import statements, 'custom_setup()', 'custom_teardown()', 'get_skip_msg()' functions",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves calling 'custom_setup()' during setup and 'custom_teardown()' during teardown; no untrusted data flow is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard test setup code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a unittest.TestCase subclass with setup and teardown methods that invoke external functions. These functions are imported from another module, and their implementation is unknown. The code's purpose is to facilitate testing, and there is no indication of malicious behavior or anomalies within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical testing base class with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a test framework, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
