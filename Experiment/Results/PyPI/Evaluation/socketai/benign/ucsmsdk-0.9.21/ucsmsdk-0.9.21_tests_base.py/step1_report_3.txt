  "purpose": "Define a base unittest class with setup and teardown procedures for testing.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tests.connection.info' module: custom_setup, custom_teardown, get_skip_msg.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "The handle from custom_setup is used in setUp and passed to custom_teardown, but no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code follows standard unittest structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and defines a test class with setup and teardown methods. It uses custom functions to initialize and clean up test resources. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard testing boilerplate with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical unit test setup with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Overall security risk is negligible.",
