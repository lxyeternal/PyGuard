  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python SDK package for Cisco UCS",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'requirements.txt', 'test-requirements.txt', 'README.md', and 'HISTORY.rst'",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data being used in security-critical operations",
  "flows": "Input files are read into variables; these are then used in the setup() function without modification",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious operations",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading requirement files and documentation files, then configuring the package with setuptools. All operations are straightforward file reads and data assignments. No code injection, no network activity, and no security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py file for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
