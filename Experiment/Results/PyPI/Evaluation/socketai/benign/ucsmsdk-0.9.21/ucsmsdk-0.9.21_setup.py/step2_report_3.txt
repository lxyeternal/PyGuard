  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- The code only reads static files (requirements, README, HISTORY) and passes data to `setuptools.setup()`.\n- No untrusted data is processed at runtime, no network activity, no code injection, and no obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations are identified.\n- The license field contains a URL, which is typical for setup scripts, not a security concern.\n- The overall structure and behavior are consistent with normal Python packaging scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious logic.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; all reports concur on this.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code present.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; the script performs only static file reads and package setup.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The license URL being a string URL rather than license text is unconventional but not malicious.\n- The reports do not identify any vulnerabilities or suspicious activity.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified as the script performs standard package setup without any security issues.\n\n### Justification:\nSince all reports agree, and the code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious operations, the scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign setup.py script for packaging a Python SDK. No issues or risks are present based on the provided analysis.\n\n**Would you like me to generate a summarized report or further analyze any specific aspect?**",
