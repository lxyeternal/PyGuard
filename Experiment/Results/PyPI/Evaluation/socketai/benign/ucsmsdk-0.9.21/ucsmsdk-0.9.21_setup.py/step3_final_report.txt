{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'ucsmsdk', reading static dependency and metadata files to configure package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt', 'test-requirements.txt', 'README.md', and 'HISTORY.rst' files for dependencies and descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications; static data used only for package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads static files (sources) and passes their content directly into setuptools.setup() (sink) without dynamic processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; license URL as a string is standard practice, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script that loads static files for package metadata and dependencies. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The license field contains a URL, which is typical in setup scripts. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. All scores—malware, obfuscated, and security risk—are correctly set to 0, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of the code.",
