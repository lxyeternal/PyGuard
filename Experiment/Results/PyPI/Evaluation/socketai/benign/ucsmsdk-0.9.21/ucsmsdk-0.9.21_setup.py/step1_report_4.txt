{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'ucsmsdk' Python package, managing dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements.txt, test-requirements.txt, README.md, and HISTORY.rst files for configuration and description data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or execution points that process external inputs at runtime.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script primarily reads static files and calls setup() with the collected data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, reads dependencies and documentation files, and invokes setup() with package metadata and requirements. No untrusted inputs are processed at runtime, and all file reads involve static, predefined files. The setup process itself is standard for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely loads static files for package configuration and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
