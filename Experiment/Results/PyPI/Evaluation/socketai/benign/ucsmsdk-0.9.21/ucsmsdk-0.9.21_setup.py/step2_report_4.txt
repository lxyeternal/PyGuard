  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the provided code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python SDK.\n- It reads static files (`requirements.txt`, `test-requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `HISTORY.rst`) and passes their contents to `setuptools.setup()`.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing is evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The license URL is a string pointing to a URL, which is common in setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code performs standard setup operations; no issues or malicious behavior are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n\n**All reports agree on these points.**\n\n---\n\n### Specific points on scoring:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign `0`, which is accurate.\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- All reports assign `0`, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Potential discrepancies or points of contention:\n\n- **License URL as a string:** Some reports mention this as unusual, but it's standard practice in setup scripts to specify license URLs as strings. No security concern here.\n- **No untrusted data or dynamic code execution:** Confirmed across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned (`malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`) are reasonable and justified.\n- No modifications needed based on the provided code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThis is a typical, benign `setup.py` script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No further action is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** In a real-world scenario, if any of the setup files or dependencies were fetched from untrusted sources or contained malicious code, the scores would need to be adjusted accordingly. But based on the current static code and reports, the current scores are appropriate.",
