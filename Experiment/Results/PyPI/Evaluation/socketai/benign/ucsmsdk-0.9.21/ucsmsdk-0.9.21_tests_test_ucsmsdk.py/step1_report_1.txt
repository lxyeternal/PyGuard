  "sources": "No input or data reading; standard import of unittest module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; test methods are placeholders",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures; only boilerplate test code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test skeleton with standard licensing comments. It imports unittest, defines a test class with setup, teardown, and a dummy test method. There are no external data sources, no untrusted data handling, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic present. The code appears to be a template or initial test structure with no malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless test skeleton with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
