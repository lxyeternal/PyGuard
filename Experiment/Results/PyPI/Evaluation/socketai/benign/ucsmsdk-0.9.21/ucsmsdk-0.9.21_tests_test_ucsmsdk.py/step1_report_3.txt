  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test skeleton for the 'ucsmsdk' module, including licensing comments and a simple test class with no actual test logic. It imports only the 'unittest' library and defines an empty test case. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communications. The code appears to be a benign template with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, harmless test scaffold with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It merely sets up a testing class with no active logic, thus no security concerns.",
