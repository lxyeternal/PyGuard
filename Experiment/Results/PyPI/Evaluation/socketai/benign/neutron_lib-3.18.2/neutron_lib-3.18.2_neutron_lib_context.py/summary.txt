  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-maintained context management module with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are justified primarily by routine deprecation warnings, not actual vulnerabilities. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
