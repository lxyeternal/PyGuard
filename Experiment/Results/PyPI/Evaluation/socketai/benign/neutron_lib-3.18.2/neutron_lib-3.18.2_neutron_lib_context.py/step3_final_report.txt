  "purpose": "Defines context classes for security, user identity, roles, and session management within an OpenStack/Neutron environment.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, class attributes, from_dict method, deprecated parameter warnings.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in class attributes, converted into dictionaries for policy evaluation, session creation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> class attributes -> to_dict()/to_policy_values() -> external policy checks or session handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated tenant_id/tenant_name with warnings; no suspicious code patterns, no external network communication, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of context management classes used in OpenStack projects. It handles user and project identification, roles, and session management with well-established patterns. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The deprecation warnings are routine notices for API evolution, not security issues. External libraries used are standard for the environment. Data flows are internal, with no external effects or leaks. The code's structure is clear and maintainable, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-maintained context management module with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are justified primarily by routine deprecation warnings, not actual vulnerabilities. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
