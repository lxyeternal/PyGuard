It includes a license and no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The dependencies are standard, and the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears safe and is typical for Python package distribution.",
