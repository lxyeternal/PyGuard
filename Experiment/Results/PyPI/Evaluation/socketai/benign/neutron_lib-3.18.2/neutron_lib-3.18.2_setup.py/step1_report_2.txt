  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Python package setup file. It imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup' with parameters that specify build requirements ('pbr>=2.0.0') and enables pbr. There are no data input operations, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The content aligns with typical package setup files and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
