  "purpose": "Static configuration constants, network statuses, prefixes, regex patterns, protocol mappings, and network parameters for OpenStack Neutron.",
  "sources": "Definitions of constants, prefixes, regex patterns, protocol mappings, and class attributes; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; static data only.",
  "flows": "Purely static definitions; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constants, regex patterns, protocol mappings, and configuration parameters. There are no dynamic code segments, no input handling, no external communication, and no obfuscation. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are justified based on the static, configuration-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module for OpenStack Neutron, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis and accurately reflect the low threat level.",
