  "purpose": "Manage worker processes, set process titles, and handle process counts within a service framework.",
  "sources": "Reads process ID via os.getpid(), class attributes, optional description parameters.",
  "sinks": "Calls setproctitle.setproctitle() to modify process title based on internal logic.",
  "flows": "Reads system PID, determines whether to set process title, constructs title string, and applies it.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; process title setting is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a service worker base class, managing process counts and titles. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no external network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The process title manipulation is controlled and typical for daemon processes. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for process management in service components, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The current low malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
