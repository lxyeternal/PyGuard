  "sources": "os, sys modules, configuration variables such as extensions, paths, and project info.",
  "sinks": "Path modifications (sys.path.insert), configuration variable assignments.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of configuration parameters; no data from untrusted sources processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, suspicious code patterns, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, declarative configuration file for documentation generation, involving path setup, extension inclusion, and project metadata. It does not perform any network activity, process untrusted input, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. All variables and imports are standard, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and standard for its purpose. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
