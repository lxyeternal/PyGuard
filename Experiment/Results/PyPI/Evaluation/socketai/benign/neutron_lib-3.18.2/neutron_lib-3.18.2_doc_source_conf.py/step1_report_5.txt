  "purpose": "Configuration and setup for Sphinx documentation generation for the Neutron Library project.",
  "sources": "os and sys modules, configuration variables, and extension lists.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains sinks that process untrusted data or user input directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily sets configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; standard configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file. It imports os and sys modules to set up directory paths and modifies sys.path for module discovery. It specifies project metadata, themes, extensions, and output options. There are no network operations, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. All modifications are static and related to documentation build setup. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Sphinx documentation configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
