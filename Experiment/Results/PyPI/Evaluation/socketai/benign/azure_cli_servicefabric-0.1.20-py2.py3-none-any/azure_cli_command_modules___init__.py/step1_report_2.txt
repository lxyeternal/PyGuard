  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for the package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Importing and calling pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code declares a namespace, which is a benign operation.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of namespace declaration is common in namespace packages; no anomalies or malicious indicators observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, only importing pkg_resources and declaring a namespace. This is typical for Python namespace packages and does not involve any data input, network activity, or sensitive operations. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code appears safe and standard for namespace packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration using pkg_resources and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
