  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, enabling it to be part of a namespace package.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing 'pkg_resources' and the call to 'declare_namespace(__name__)'",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or user input",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares a namespace",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; standard namespace declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' with '__name__'. This is a standard pattern used to declare a namespace package in Python, allowing multiple packages to share a common namespace. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no data input/output handling, and no obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration without malicious intent or security concerns. It is a typical component of Python package setup and does not pose security risks.",
