  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only declares a namespace without data flow",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual patterns; standard namespace declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' with '__name__', which is a common pattern for defining namespace packages in Python. There are no dynamic or suspicious operations, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data processing. The license comment indicates compliance with open-source licensing. No malicious behaviors or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks.",
