  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only declares a namespace without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard namespace declaration pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace with declare_namespace(__name__). It is a minimal, standard pattern used in Python packaging. No data processing, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. Scores assigned by the reports are all zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are appropriate given the benign nature. The code poses no security threat or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no malicious activity or security concerns. The scores are accurate and consistent with its purpose.",
