  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, likely part of a larger package or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only executes namespace declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace declaration; no anomalies or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace using 'declare_namespace', which is a standard practice in Python package development for namespace packages. No malicious or suspicious operations are present. The code does not read external input, write data, or perform any network or system operations. It appears to be a typical namespace declaration without obfuscation or hidden intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is part of a package's namespace setup and does not contain any malicious or suspicious code.",
