  "purpose": "This code defines help documentation and command metadata for Azure Service Fabric cluster management CLI commands. It provides usage examples and descriptions for various cluster operations.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of help text and command examples; no data input or external data reads present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; the code primarily contains static strings and command syntax descriptions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive functions; the command examples are static and do not process external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hidden behaviors, or obfuscated code; no hardcoded secrets or credentials detected in the static strings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of static help documentation for CLI commands related to Azure Service Fabric management. The command examples are predefined and do not involve dynamic data processing, user input handling, or network operations within this code snippet. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The presence of placeholder URLs in command examples is standard for documentation purposes and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static help documentation script for CLI commands. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It serves solely as user guidance for Azure Service Fabric management operations.",
