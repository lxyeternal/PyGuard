  "purpose": "Define help documentation and command-line interface (CLI) commands for managing Azure Service Fabric clusters and applications.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'knack.help_files', help documentation strings for CLI commands and groups.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly contains static help documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present in the code. The only potentially sensitive information is in the example command strings, which are not executed but serve as documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily static help documentation for a CLI tool managing Azure Service Fabric. It imports a module for help strings, and assigns multiple help strings to various command groups and commands, with example usage provided for some commands. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data processing. The help strings include placeholders for secrets or identifiers, which are typical in documentation but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, code injection, or data leaks are present. No signs of obfuscation or malware are evident. The overall structure and content suggest a straightforward CLI help documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static help documentation for Azure Service Fabric CLI commands with no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks identified. It contains no executable code or sensitive data beyond placeholder examples. The overall security risk is negligible.",
