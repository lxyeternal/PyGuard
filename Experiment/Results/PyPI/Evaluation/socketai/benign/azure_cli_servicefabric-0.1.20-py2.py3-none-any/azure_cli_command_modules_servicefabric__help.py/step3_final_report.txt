  "purpose": "Static help documentation strings for Azure Service Fabric CLI commands, providing command summaries and examples.",
  "sources": "Help string definitions and command example texts within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; static strings with no data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; static help strings with placeholders for secrets, which are standard in documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static help strings and command examples for Azure CLI. No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or executable logic is present. The placeholders for secrets are typical in documentation and do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, embedded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static help documentation for Azure Service Fabric CLI commands, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are justified and should remain as is.",
