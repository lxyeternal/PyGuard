{
  "purpose": "Defines help documentation for Azure Service Fabric CLI commands and groups, providing descriptions and usage examples.",
  "sources": "The code reads only static strings, command descriptions, and example texts; no external input sources or data ingestion points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present; the code does not process or handle untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is purely static documentation definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. It mostly consists of string definitions and comments.",
  "analysis": "The script is a set of static help documentation for CLI commands related to Azure Service Fabric. It includes command descriptions, examples, and groupings. There are no dynamic data processing, user input handling, network operations, or credential management within this code. The only notable aspect is the presence of example strings containing URLs with placeholders for secrets and key vaults, which are typical in documentation but do not execute or handle secrets directly. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code appears to serve purely informational purposes without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign static documentation for CLI commands, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not process or handle untrusted data and contains no malicious code or obfuscation.",
