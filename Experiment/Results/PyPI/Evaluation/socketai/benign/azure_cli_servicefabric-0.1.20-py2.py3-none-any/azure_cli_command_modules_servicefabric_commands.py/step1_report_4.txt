{
  "purpose": "Defines CLI command groups and commands for managing Azure Service Fabric clusters and application certificates.",
  "sources": "Import statements, command group and command definitions, client factory functions",
  "sinks": "Function calls to client factory, command execution functions (e.g., get, list, add, remove, update)",
  "flows": "User or system invokes CLI commands -> commands call specific functions like 'get', 'list_cluster', 'add_app_cert' -> functions interact with Azure management API via client factory",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious logic observed. The code primarily sets up command interfaces without handling sensitive data directly.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines command groups with associated operations, and registers various commands related to Service Fabric cluster management and certificates. All command handlers are referenced by name (e.g., 'get', 'list_cluster', 'add_app_cert') but are not implemented within this snippet. There is no evidence of data manipulation, data leakage, or malicious activity. The code appears to be a typical CLI command setup for Azure SDK extensions, relying on external functions and factory methods. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for Azure CLI commands related to Service Fabric. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious behaviors. The only potential security concern could relate to the functions invoked (e.g., 'add_app_cert'), but these are external and not part of this code snippet. Overall, it appears safe and intentionally designed for managing cloud resources.",
