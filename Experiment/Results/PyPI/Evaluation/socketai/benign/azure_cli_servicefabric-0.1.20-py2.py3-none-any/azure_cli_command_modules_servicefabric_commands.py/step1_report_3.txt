{
  "purpose": "Defines CLI command groups and commands for managing Azure Service Fabric clusters and application certificates.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core.commands and local module _client_factory; command definitions within load_command_table function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network operations, file writes, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static command registration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up command groups and commands for Azure CLI extensions related to Service Fabric. It uses a client factory for creating service clients and defines multiple commands such as 'show', 'list', 'create', and certificate management commands. There are no network operations, data processing, or handling of untrusted input within this code. All commands appear to be standard CLI command registration without any suspicious logic or embedded malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard CLI command registration code for Azure Service Fabric management, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified.",
