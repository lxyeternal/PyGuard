  "purpose": "Register CLI commands for Azure Service Fabric management, including cluster and application certificate operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, command group definitions, and command registrations invoking external handler functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; the code primarily maps commands to functions.",
  "flows": "Command group creation → command registration → invocation of external handler functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI extension setup for Azure Service Fabric, registering command groups and commands with associated handler functions. It contains no user input processing, network activity, or sensitive data handling within this snippet. External functions are assumed to be implemented securely. No malicious or obfuscated code patterns are present. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the reports (around 0.1) are justified given the benign nature of the code. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The overall structure indicates a safe, standard infrastructure code for CLI command registration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
