{
  "purpose": "Defines CLI command groups and commands for managing Azure Service Fabric clusters and certificates.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core.commands and local module ._client_factory.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; commands are defined for Azure resource management, potentially accepting user input parameters.",
  "flows": "User invokes CLI commands; command functions interact with Azure SDK and services.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up command groups and associates them with specific handler functions. It imports required modules, defines command groups, and registers commands for cluster and certificate management. The commands are linked to functions such as 'get', 'list_cluster', 'add_app_cert', etc., which are assumed to be implemented elsewhere. No dynamic code execution, insecure practices, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure aligns with standard CLI extension practices for Azure SDK.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard CLI command registration script for Azure Service Fabric management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment. Its purpose is to facilitate cluster and certificate operations in Azure.",
