{
  "purpose": "Define command groups and commands for Azure Service Fabric CLI extensions, primarily for managing clusters and certificates.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules and functions; references to client factory functions; command definitions with command names and associated function handlers.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as there is no untrusted data input, network communication, or sensitive data handling shown.",
  "flows": "The code initializes command groups and maps commands to handler functions; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected. The code appears standard for CLI command registration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines command groups with specific command mappings, and associates commands with handler functions. No user input processing, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs here. All functions and variables are used in standard CLI extension registration. The code structure is typical for Azure CLI extensions and does not contain suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard CLI command registration script for Azure Service Fabric, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It primarily maps commands to handler functions without processing untrusted input or performing unsafe operations.",
