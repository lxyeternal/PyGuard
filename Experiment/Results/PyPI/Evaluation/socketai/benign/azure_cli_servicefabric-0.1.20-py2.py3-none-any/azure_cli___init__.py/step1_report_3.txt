  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for the package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Importing the pkg_resources module and calling declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simply declares namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the use of declare_namespace is a standard namespace declaration, no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and uses declare_namespace(__name__) to declare a namespace for package resources, which is a common practice for Python namespace packages. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious intent. No input/output operations, data leaks, or external communications are present. The only potential concern is if the package is used maliciously in a broader context, but this code alone does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears as standard boilerplate code for a namespace package.",
