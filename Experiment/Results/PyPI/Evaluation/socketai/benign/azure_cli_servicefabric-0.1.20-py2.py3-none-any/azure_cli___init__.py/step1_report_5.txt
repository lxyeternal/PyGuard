  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package to allow extension and modularization.",
  "sources": "import statement: pkg_resources (a package used for resource access and plugin management).",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present; the code only declares a namespace without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard namespace declaration typical in Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace using 'declare_namespace'. This is common in namespace packages to enable extension. There are no indications of malicious behavior, no input/output processing, and no suspicious code structures. The code is minimal and appears legitimate and standard for a namespace package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code used in packaging and does not perform any harmful actions.",
