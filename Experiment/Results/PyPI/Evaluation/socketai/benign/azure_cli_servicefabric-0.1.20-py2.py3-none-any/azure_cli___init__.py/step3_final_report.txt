  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import pkg_resources -> declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward namespace declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace using declare_namespace(__name__). This is a standard pattern in Python packaging for namespace packages. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, external communications, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal, clear, and widely used in open-source projects. No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security issues are present. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated score as 0, and security risk score as 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration used in Python packaging, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
