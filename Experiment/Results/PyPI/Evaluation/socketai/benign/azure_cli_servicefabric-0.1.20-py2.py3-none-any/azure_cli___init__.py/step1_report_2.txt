  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources for modular packaging.",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources and calling declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only declares a namespace",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a standard namespace declaration with no suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and calls declare_namespace, which is a typical pattern for creating namespace packages. No input handling, no data processing, no network or file I/O, and no use of environment variables or credentials. The code is very minimal and standard for Python namespace packages, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package declaration with no malicious intent or security issues.",
