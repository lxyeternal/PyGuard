  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, enabling the distribution of a package without a specific implementation, typically used for plugin systems or modular packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __name__ variable to declare a namespace.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The namespace declaration is static; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of namespace declaration is standard; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages. It imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace, which is common for modular packages. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns are present. There are no input or output operations that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace declaration for packaging purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
