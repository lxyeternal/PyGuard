{
  "purpose": "Declare namespace for the package, enabling it to be part of a larger namespace package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely declares a namespace; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace for the current package. This is a standard practice for namespace packages in Python. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data processing, no code injection, or any other suspicious activity. The code is minimal and follows conventional patterns for namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical namespace declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves to support namespace packaging, which is a legitimate and common practice.",
