  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for a Python project, allowing the distribution of sub-packages across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) to declare a namespace.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, there are no data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code simply declares a namespace without any additional logic or data handling; no suspicious or unusual code behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and calls declare_namespace with __name__, which is a standard way to set up namespace packages in Python. It contains no input handling, data processing, or external communication. The license comment is standard for open-source projects. Overall, this is typical package initialization code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
