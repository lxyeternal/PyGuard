{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, likely part of a larger package distribution.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import pkg_resources' reads the package_resources module from setuptools, which is an external library.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or sensitive operations are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is identifiable, as the code only imports and declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current package as a namespace, which is common in Python packaging for modular distribution. There are no input sources beyond the import, and no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present. The purpose appears solely to facilitate namespace packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration used in Python packaging, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
