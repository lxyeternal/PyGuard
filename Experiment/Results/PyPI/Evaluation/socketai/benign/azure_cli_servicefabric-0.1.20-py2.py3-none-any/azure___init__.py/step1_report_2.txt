  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, typically used for modular packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'pkg_resources.declare_namespace' is an uncommon pattern in newer Python packaging but not inherently malicious; no other unusual activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace with '__name__', which is a standard practice for namespace packages in Python. This pattern is often used for modular distribution of packages and is supported by setuptools. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. It is a minimal, benign snippet solely for package namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is typical boilerplate code used in Python packaging systems.",
