  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communications",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input or output",
  "anomalies": "Standard namespace declaration; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module from setuptools and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a common pattern for creating namespace packages in Python, allowing multiple distributions to contribute to the same package namespace. No input/output handling, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a standard purpose of namespace declaration in Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears as boilerplate code for package setup with no security concerns.",
