  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources' declare_namespace method.",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication; code is declarative.",
  "flows": "Import pkg_resources -> call declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward namespace declaration with no suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and calls declare_namespace(__name__), a standard pattern for namespace packages in Python. It involves no data input, output, external communication, or dynamic code execution. The code is minimal, clear, and aligns with common practices. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious intents. Slight elevation to 0.1 in some reports' risk scores appears unwarranted given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign boilerplate for namespace declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its benign nature; the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The security risk score should be adjusted to 0 for consistency, as no vulnerabilities are present.",
