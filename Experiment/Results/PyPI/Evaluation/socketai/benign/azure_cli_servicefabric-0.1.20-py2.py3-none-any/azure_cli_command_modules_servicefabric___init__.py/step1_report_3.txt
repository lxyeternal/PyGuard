  "purpose": "Define a command loader class for Azure Service Fabric CLI commands and import related modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for azure.cli.core, azure.cli.command_modules.servicefabric, and internal modules for command table and argument loading.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code; no dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements to class definition, class methods to loading command tables and arguments; no untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard Azure CLI modules and class inheritance appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from AzCommandsLoader, which customizes command loading for Azure Service Fabric. It imports necessary modules and sets up command type and resource type, then provides methods to load command tables and arguments. All imports are standard for Azure CLI extension development. No network calls, no data manipulation, and no execution of untrusted input are present. The structure and content are typical for CLI command loader implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Azure CLI extension module for Service Fabric with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It primarily sets up command loading infrastructure and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
