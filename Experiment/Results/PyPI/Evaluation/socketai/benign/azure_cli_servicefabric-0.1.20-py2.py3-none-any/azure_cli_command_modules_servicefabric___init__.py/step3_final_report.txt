  "purpose": "Defines a command loader class for Azure Service Fabric CLI commands, setting up command types and loading command tables and arguments.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core, azure.cli.command_modules, and external functions load_command_table and load_arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of command type, loading command table, and loading arguments functions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a CLI command loader, importing standard modules, initializing command types, and calling external functions to load command tables and arguments. It contains no network calls, data leaks, or malicious patterns. The code structure is typical for Azure CLI extensions, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior. The scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, and the security risk is minimal (0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of an Azure CLI command loader for Service Fabric, with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
