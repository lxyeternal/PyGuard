  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is a standard Azure CLI command loader for Service Fabric, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** Given the code is straightforward, importing standard modules, defining a class, and loading command tables and arguments without any network or data exfiltration, these scores seem appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's straightforward nature, standard imports, and lack of suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The securityRisk is slightly above zero, but given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions, this seems a conservative but acceptable score.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a typical CLI extension loader with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; standard command loader setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Slightly elevated securityRisk score, but justified given the code's nature.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; standard pattern, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The minor securityRisk score reflects a conservative stance but aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, matching the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the conservative approach, but the code itself does not warrant higher scores.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal concern, but consistent with the benign code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns well with the code's nature. No further adjustments are necessary.",
