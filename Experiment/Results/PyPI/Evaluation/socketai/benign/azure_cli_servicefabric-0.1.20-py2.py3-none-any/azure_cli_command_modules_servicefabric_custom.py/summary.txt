  "conclusion": "The code is complex and interacts with sensitive Azure resources, including certificates and secrets. It contains several security concerns such as hardcoded defaults, insecure waiting mechanisms, and potential exposure of sensitive data in logs. The certificate management functions are critical points where malicious certificates or secrets could be introduced, leading to privilege escalation or data exfiltration. Overall, the code exhibits high security risks, especially in certificate handling and secret management, warranting strict review and secure coding practices."
