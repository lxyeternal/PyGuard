  "purpose": "Define argument parsers and CLI command configurations for managing Service Fabric clusters via Azure CLI.",
  "sources": "User input via CLI arguments, configuration files, environment variables (implied through CLI parameters).",
  "sinks": "Configuration parameters passed to CLI commands; no direct sink of untrusted data to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "User provides input to CLI -> arguments parsed -> passed to Azure SDK functions (not shown) for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration detected. Use of helper functions like get_json_object for JSON config parsing is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI argument setup for Azure Service Fabric management. It imports Azure CLI core modules and defines argument contexts for various subcommands, specifying argument types, help descriptions, and validation functions. No data is processed insecurely; no network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The functions and arguments are aligned with expected CLI configurations. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are identified. The code appears to be benign and solely for CLI argument definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical argument parser setup for CLI commands related to Azure Service Fabric management. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The structure and content are standard, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
