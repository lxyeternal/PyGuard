  "purpose": "The code defines CLI argument configurations for Azure Service Fabric management commands, setting up parameters, help texts, and validation functions.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, helper functions like get_enum_type, get_json_object, and argument registration calls within argument_context blocks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external calls, or network operations; only argument definitions and validation functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from CLI invoke validators and are used in command execution; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs. Use of standard Azure CLI validation functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward CLI argument registration for Azure Service Fabric commands. It uses standard modules and functions, with no external calls, network activity, or data exfiltration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The parameters are typical for configuration scripts, and the code structure is clear and well-organized. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to handling of sensitive parameters like certificates, but this is standard in such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score should be very low, around 0 or 0.1, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI argument setup for Azure Service Fabric management. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security threat present. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate. The risk score can be maintained at 0 or 0.1, with 0 being more accurate given the benign content.",
