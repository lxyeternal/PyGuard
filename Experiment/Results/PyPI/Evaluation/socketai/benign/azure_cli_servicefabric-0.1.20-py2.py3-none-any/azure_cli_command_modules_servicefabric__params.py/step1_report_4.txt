  "purpose": "Defines argument parsing configurations for Azure CLI commands related to Service Fabric clusters.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from azure.cli.core and reads command-line arguments for various CLI commands.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive operations or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from command-line interface are assigned to command context arguments; no flow to external systems observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of get_json_object with file loading is legitimate for configuration, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets up CLI argument parsers for Azure Service Fabric management commands. All arguments are related to configuration options, such as resource names, files, and parameters. There are no operations involving data processing, external network connections, or dynamic code execution. The use of get_json_object to load JSON configurations from files is standard. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI argument setup script for Azure Service Fabric, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard, benign configuration code.",
