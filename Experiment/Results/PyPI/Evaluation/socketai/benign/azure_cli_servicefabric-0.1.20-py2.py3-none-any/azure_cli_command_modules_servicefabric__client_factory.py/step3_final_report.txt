  "purpose": "Factory functions to create Azure management service clients for various resource types using the Azure CLI context.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'cli_ctx' and 'kwargs' passed into functions; imported modules from azure.cli.core and azure.mgmt packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions return client objects without processing untrusted input or performing data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (cli_ctx, kwargs) flow into get_mgmt_service_client calls, returning resource management clients; no further data flow or external communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward factory functions importing Azure SDK modules and returning management clients via get_mgmt_service_client. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as standard SDK usage with no security issues. The functions rely on parameters typical for Azure CLI extensions, and no data leakage or malicious activity is evident. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, safe Azure SDK client factory functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
