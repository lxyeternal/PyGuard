  "purpose": "Factory functions for creating Azure management service clients for various resource types.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and functions for client creation, and defines functions that invoke these imports with parameters.",
  "sinks": "The functions return client objects obtained via get_mgmt_service_client; these clients could potentially be misused if their interfaces are exploited, but the code itself does not perform such actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (cli_ctx, kwargs) are used to invoke get_mgmt_service_client, which returns client objects; these objects could then be used elsewhere for management tasks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward factory pattern implementation. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple factory functions importing modules and creating service clients for Azure resource management. All imports are standard Azure SDK modules, and function calls are simple wrappers passing context and parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The pattern is typical for SDK client setup in management scripts. No anomalies or suspicious activities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard factory functions for creating Azure management clients. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this code segment.",
