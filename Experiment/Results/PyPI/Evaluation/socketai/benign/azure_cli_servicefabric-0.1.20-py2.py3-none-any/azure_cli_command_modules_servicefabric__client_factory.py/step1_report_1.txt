  "purpose": "Define factory functions to create various Azure service clients for managing resources such as Service Fabric, Resource Groups, Key Vault, Compute, Storage, and Network.",
  "sources": "Function definitions that import modules and call get_mgmt_service_client with specific resource types or clients.",
  "sinks": "Calls to get_mgmt_service_client which could potentially receive untrusted parameters, but in this context, they are function arguments used to create clients.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (cli_ctx, kwargs) are passed into factory functions, which then invoke get_mgmt_service_client with specific resource types, returning client instances.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Use of standard Azure SDK patterns. No data leakage or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of factory functions importing Azure SDK modules and returning service client instances via get_mgmt_service_client. All functions use standard SDK practices, with no data manipulation, network activity, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The structure is straightforward, aimed at resource management in Azure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate set of client factory functions for Azure SDK resource management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs standard resource client creation based on provided context and resource types.",
