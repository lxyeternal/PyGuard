  "purpose": "Define factory functions to create Azure management service clients for various Azure services.",
  "sources": "Imports within functions, function parameters (cli_ctx, kwargs), and the return statements calling get_mgmt_service_client.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows through get_mgmt_service_client calls, but these are standard SDK calls; no external data used directly in sinks.",
  "flows": "Input 'cli_ctx' flows into get_mgmt_service_client calls, which instantiate service clients for Azure management APIs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling are present. Code follows standard factory pattern for SDK clients.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple factory functions for creating Azure service clients using Azure CLI context. All imports are standard, localized within functions, and only invoke SDK methods. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors are observed. The functions are straightforward wrappers around SDK client instantiation. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The structure and imports are typical for Azure SDK client setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Azure SDK client factory code with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and serves the purpose of providing authenticated service clients within the Azure CLI environment.",
