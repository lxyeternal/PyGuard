  "purpose": "Provide factory functions to create Azure management service clients for various resources.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (cli_ctx, kwargs) used as input for client creation.",
  "sinks": "Returning the result of get_mgmt_service_client, which is a client object; no data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into get_mgmt_service_client calls, which instantiate client objects; no data leakage or processing of untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The code strictly imports Azure SDK modules and returns client instances. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no data exfiltration or malicious actions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple factory functions that import necessary Azure SDK modules and invoke get_mgmt_service_client with context parameters. All functions are straightforward and do not process or store data beyond creating service clients. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injections. The code appears to be standard SDK usage for managing Azure resources, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of factory functions for creating Azure resource management clients. It exhibits no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It is standard, safe SDK usage without obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
