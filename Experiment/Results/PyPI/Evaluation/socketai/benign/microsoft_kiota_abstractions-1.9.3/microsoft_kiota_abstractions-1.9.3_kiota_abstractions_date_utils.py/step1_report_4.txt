  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to parse ISO8601 durations, timedelta strings, and ISO-formatted date/time strings into timedelta, datetime, and time objects.",
  "sources": "Input parameters of functions: text strings in ISO8601 or hh:mm:ss formats.",
  "sinks": "Uses built-in Python functions like datetime.fromisoformat and time.fromisoformat; no dangerous sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed via regex or built-in functions, with no untrusted data flowing into system calls or external resources.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code appears to perform standard parsing operations with fallback mechanisms for older Python versions. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns to parse ISO8601 durations and timedelta strings. It uses built-in functions like datetime.fromisoformat and time.fromisoformat with workarounds for Python versions <= 3.10. No data is transmitted externally, and no suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The functions handle input validation and error raising appropriately. Overall, the code performs utility parsing without any malicious intent or dangerous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for parsing date and time strings with version compatibility considerations. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious patterns are detected. It appears safe and legitimate.",
