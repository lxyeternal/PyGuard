{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse ISO8601 duration, timedelta, and datetime strings into timedelta, datetime, and time objects, respectively, supporting compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: 'text' strings for parsing.",
  "sinks": "Uses built-in parsing methods such as datetime.fromisoformat() and time.fromisoformat(), which do not involve untrusted data directly affecting system state or leaking data.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into parsing functions, which process the data through regex matching and built-in parsing methods. No untrusted data flows into system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regex to handle time and duration strings for compatibility, but does not perform any suspicious or unusual operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Compatibility code for older Python versions is standard and transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for parsing ISO8601 duration and datetime strings, including fallbacks for older Python versions. It relies on standard library functions like re, datetime, and sys, with regex used for string transformations. No external calls, network operations, or suspicious manipulations are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are detected. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for robust parsing with compatibility considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for parsing date and duration strings with Python version compatibility support. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. It functions solely as utility parsing code without side effects.",
