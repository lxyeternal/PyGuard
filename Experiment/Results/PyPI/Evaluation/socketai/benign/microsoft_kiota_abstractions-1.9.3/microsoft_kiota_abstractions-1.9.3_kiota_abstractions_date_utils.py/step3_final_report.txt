  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing ISO8601 durations, datetime, and time strings with compatibility support for Python versions below 3.11.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to parsing functions: ISO8601 duration strings, hh:mm:ss format, ISO8601 datetime strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into system calls, network, or external data sinks; parsing functions process input strings locally.",
  "flows": "Input strings are matched and processed via regex and standard library functions; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for compatibility adjustments is standard; no suspicious or obfuscated code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for parsing ISO8601 durations, timedelta strings, and datetime/time strings, with fallback handling for older Python versions. It uses regex patterns for parsing, with error handling and compatibility adjustments. No external system calls, network operations, or data leaks are present. The regex and parsing logic are straightforward and standard. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The compatibility code for fractional seconds is a known workaround and does not introduce vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for date/time parsing, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal security risk score reflects the standard regex compatibility handling, which is safe. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
