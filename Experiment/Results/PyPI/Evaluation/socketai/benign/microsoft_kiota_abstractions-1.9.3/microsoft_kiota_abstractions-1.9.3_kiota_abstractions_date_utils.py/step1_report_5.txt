  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing ISO8601 duration, timedelta, datetime, and time strings, supporting compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Regular expressions for matching duration and timedelta formats; system version info; input strings for date/time parsing.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input directly into sensitive operations; mainly parses strings into datetime objects.",
  "flows": "Input strings (e.g., ISO8601 durations, datetime strings) are matched with regex patterns, then parsed into timedelta, datetime, or time objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; use of regex for parsing is straightforward and safe; no suspicious network or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines regex patterns and functions for parsing date/time strings with compatibility support for Python versions below 3.11. It uses standard library modules (sys, re, datetime) and handles input validation carefully. The parsing functions include version checks and regex-based fixes for fractional seconds. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The functions are for safe string parsing; no external or untrusted data is directly executed or transmitted. No obfuscation or malware patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of safe utility functions for date/time parsing with version compatibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is a standard implementation for parsing ISO8601 durations and datetime strings with fallback support for older Python versions.",
