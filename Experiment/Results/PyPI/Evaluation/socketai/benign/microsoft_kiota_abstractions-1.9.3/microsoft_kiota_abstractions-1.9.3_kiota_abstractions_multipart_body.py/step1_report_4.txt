  "purpose": "Defines a MultipartBody class for constructing and serializing multipart HTTP request/response bodies, supporting various data types such as strings, bytes, and Parsable objects.",
  "sources": "Reads from method parameters (part_name, content_type, part_value, filename), accesses self.parts dictionary, uses request_adapter to obtain serialization writers.",
  "sinks": "Writes serialized multipart data to provided SerializationWriter; potentially writes to network or files depending on writer implementation.",
  "flows": "Method add_or_replace_part: source is method arguments, sink is self.parts dictionary; serialize method: source is self.parts, sink is writer.write_* methods for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries and methods appears normal. No data exfiltration, network communication, or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a multipart body builder with methods to add, remove, and serialize parts, supporting various data types. It relies on external request_adapter and SerializationWriter for output. No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or malicious data flows were found. The methods are straightforward, with validation checks for input parameters and proper handling of data serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for constructing multipart HTTP messages, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as a utility class for serialization tasks. Overall, no security threats or malware behaviors are evident.",
