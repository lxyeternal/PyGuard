{
  "purpose": "Defines a generic MultipartBody class to construct and serialize multipart HTTP request or response bodies, supporting various data types and parts.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters, including part_value, part_name, and file-like objects (io.IOBase). Uses request_adapter to get serialization writers.",
  "sinks": "Writes serialized multipart data to the provided SerializationWriter, which may output to network or file systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (part_value, filenames) flows into add_or_replace_part() -> serialize() -> writer methods, with potential intermediate serialization via request_adapter for Parsable parts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code properly handles different data types for multipart parts and uses standard UUIDs for boundaries. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed. No suspicious network activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a multipart request builder, with methods to add, remove, retrieve parts, and serialize them. It uses type safety and proper validation. It leverages existing serialization infrastructure without executing untrusted code directly. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or harmful actions. The logic appears straightforward, focusing on multipart data assembly and serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a multipart HTTP body builder with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for assembling multipart data, with appropriate input validation and structured serialization. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
