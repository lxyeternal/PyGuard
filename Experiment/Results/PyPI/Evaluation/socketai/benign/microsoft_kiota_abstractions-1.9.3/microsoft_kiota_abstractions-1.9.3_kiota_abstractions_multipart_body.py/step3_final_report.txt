{
  "purpose": "This class constructs and serializes multipart HTTP request or response bodies, supporting various data types for each part.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (part_name, content_type, part_value, filename), internal parts dictionary, external request_adapter and serialization interfaces.",
  "sinks": "SerializationWriter's write methods (write_str_value, write_bytes_value, write_object_value), which output the multipart content.",
  "flows": "Parts are added or replaced in the internal dictionary, then serialized by writing boundaries, headers, and content to the writer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; standard multipart serialization logic. External dependencies (request_adapter, writer) are typical but could be attack vectors if compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation on input parameters, manages parts with normalization, and serializes data supporting multiple types. It does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. The reliance on external serialization interfaces is standard for such frameworks. No signs of malicious behavior or security flaws are present. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and align with typical multipart handling utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of multipart data serialization with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
