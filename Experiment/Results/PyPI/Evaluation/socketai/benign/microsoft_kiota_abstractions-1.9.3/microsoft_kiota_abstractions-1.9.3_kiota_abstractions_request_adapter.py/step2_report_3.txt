  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the Reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as an abstract base class/interface for an HTTP request adapter, with no concrete implementations.\n- They consistently note the absence of executable logic, data handling, or network activity within this snippet.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is purely structural, serving as a contract for subclasses to implement.\n\n**Code Confirmations:**\n\n- The code contains only class and method signatures, with no runtime code, data processing, or network calls.\n- All methods are abstract, meaning no executable logic exists here that could be malicious.\n- Imports are standard or internal modules, with no external untrusted data sources or suspicious imports.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident in this abstract class.\n- The reports do not identify any anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is well-structured and follows standard design patterns for an SDK interface.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of executable or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Consistently 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign a very low or zero risk score, which aligns with the code's nature as an abstract interface.\n\n**Potential Risks or Concerns:**\n\n- Since this is an abstract class, its security implications depend on the concrete subclasses and how they handle data.\n- However, the interface itself is safe and standard.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured abstract interface for an HTTP request adapter.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are present in this snippet.\n- The consistent, cautious scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering potential misuse in subclasses, but given the abstract nature, 0 is justified)\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is purely structural, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. It does not contain any malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The security posture of this component is neutral and depends on implementation, which is not part of this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, non-malicious abstract interface for an HTTP request adapter, posing no security risk.",
