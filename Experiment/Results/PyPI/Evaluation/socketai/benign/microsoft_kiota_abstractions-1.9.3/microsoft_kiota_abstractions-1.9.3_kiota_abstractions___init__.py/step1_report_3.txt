  "sources": "Importing VERSION from a local module ._version",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs",
  "flows": "Importing VERSION into __version__, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no suspicious or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module and assigns it to __version__. There are no input/output operations, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The structure is minimal and typical for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages version information for the package.",
