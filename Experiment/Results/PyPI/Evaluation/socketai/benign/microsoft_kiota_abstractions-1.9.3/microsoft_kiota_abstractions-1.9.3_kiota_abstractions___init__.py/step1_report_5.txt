  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version value from a local module and assigns it to __version__, which is typical in Python packages. No external data input, no suspicious logic, and no obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for Python package versioning, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
