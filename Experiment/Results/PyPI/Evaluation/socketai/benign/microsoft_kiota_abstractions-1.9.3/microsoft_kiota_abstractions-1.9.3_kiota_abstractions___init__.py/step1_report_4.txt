  "purpose": "Defines core abstractions for kiota generated libraries in Python, primarily setting the version.",
  "sources": "Imports VERSION from a relative module '_version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the import statement to setting __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module and assigns it to __version__. There is no input/output, no processing of untrusted data, and no suspicious behavior. The code is typical for module versioning and metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and appears to serve as metadata for the library. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
