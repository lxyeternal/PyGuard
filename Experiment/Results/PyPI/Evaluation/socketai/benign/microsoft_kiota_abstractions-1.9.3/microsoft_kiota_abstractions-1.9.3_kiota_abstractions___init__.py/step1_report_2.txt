  "purpose": "Define and set the version information for the kiota generated Python library",

  "sinks": "Assigning __version__ with VERSION (potential exposure if VERSION is maliciously set)",
  "flows": "VERSION from ._version -> __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code imports a VERSION variable from a local module and assigns it to __version__. This is a standard practice for defining package version information. There are no suspicious imports, data flows, or unusual code constructs. The source is a local module, which reduces the risk of external malicious input. The code appears to be straightforward version handling without any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and benign, serving to define the package version. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
