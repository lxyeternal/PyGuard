  "purpose": "Set the package version information by importing a version string from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version module where VERSION is defined.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__ variable; no untrusted data or external input involved.",
  "flows": "Import of VERSION from local module -> assignment to __version__",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a VERSION variable from a local module and assigns it to __version__, a common pattern in Python packaging. There are no signs of external data input, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code's simplicity and the use of a local module minimize security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The potential concern about maliciously set VERSION is theoretical and unlikely unless the local module is compromised, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version assignment pattern with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
