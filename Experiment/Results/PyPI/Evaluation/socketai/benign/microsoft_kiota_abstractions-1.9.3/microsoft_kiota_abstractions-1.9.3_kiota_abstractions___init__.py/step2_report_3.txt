  "review": "Let's review the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:  \nAll reports describe the same minimal code snippet: importing a version string from a local module (`._version` or `._version`) and assigning it to `__version__`. This is a common pattern in Python packages for version management.\n\n2. **Code Analysis & Behavior**:  \n- No untrusted input or external data flows are involved.  \n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.  \n- The code is straightforward, serving solely to set version information.\n\n3. **Potential Risks & Malicious Behavior**:  \n- Since the `VERSION` variable is imported from a local module, the risk of malicious input is minimal unless the local module itself is compromised.  \n- The reports correctly identify that this is standard package versioning code with no malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.  \n- Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the clear, minimal code.\n\n5. **Any Logical Flaws or Assumptions?**  \n- The reports assume the local module `._version` is safe and trustworthy. If the local module is compromised, it could potentially contain malicious code, but this is outside the scope of the provided code snippet.  \n- The only minor point is the mention of potential exposure if `VERSION` is maliciously set, but since it is imported from a local module, this risk is minimal unless the module itself is malicious.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores**:  \n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.  \n- The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Final assessment**:  \n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is standard, safe, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's simplicity and intent.",
