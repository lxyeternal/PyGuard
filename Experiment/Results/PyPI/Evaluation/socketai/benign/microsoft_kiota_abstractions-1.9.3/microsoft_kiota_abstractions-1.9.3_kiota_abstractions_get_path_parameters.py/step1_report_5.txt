{
  "purpose": "The function 'get_path_parameters' processes input parameters, either as a string or a dictionary, and returns a dictionary of parameters, potentially used for constructing request URLs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: the 'parameters' argument which can be a string or dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The returned dictionary 'result' which may be used later in URL construction or HTTP request handling.",
  "flows": "Input 'parameters' (string or dict) -> function processing -> output 'result' dict",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious external calls, and no data leakage mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward and lacks any suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function that handles input of different types and creates a dictionary of parameters. It performs type checks and assigns input data accordingly. There are no external data sources, no untrusted inputs processed insecurely, and no evident malicious behavior. The usage of 'RequestInformation.RAW_URL_KEY' is a reference key for raw URL data, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple data handling without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility function for request parameter processing.",
