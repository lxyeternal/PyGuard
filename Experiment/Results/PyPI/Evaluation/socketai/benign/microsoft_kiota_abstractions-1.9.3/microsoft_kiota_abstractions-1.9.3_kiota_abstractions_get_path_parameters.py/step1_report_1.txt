{
  "purpose": "The function processes input parameters to produce a dictionary of path parameters, either from a string URL or a dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: either a string or a dictionary passed to get_path_parameters.",
  "sinks": "The function itself does not contain sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "If the input is a string, it is stored under a specific key in the result; if a dictionary, its items are copied into the result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The function performs straightforward data handling without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes a parameter which can be either a string or a dictionary. If a string, it adds it to the result with a key from RequestInformation.RAW_URL_KEY. If a dictionary, it copies all key-value pairs into a new dictionary. No external calls, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no evident malicious logic. The code appears to be standard utility code for handling request parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to be a utility function for processing request parameters. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. There are no anomalies or signs of obfuscation. Overall, the code is safe.",
