  "purpose": "Utility function to process input parameters, either as a string or dictionary, into a standardized dictionary format.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'parameters' (string or dict), internal reference to 'RequestInformation.RAW_URL_KEY' when input is a string.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to the result dictionary; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'parameters' -> type check -> either store in dict under 'RAW_URL_KEY' or copy key-value pairs -> return result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type handling and dictionary operations; no obfuscation or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple type checking and dictionary copying. No external calls, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. It safely processes input data into a dictionary, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The function is a benign utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe, straightforward nature. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report can be adjusted to 0, as no vulnerabilities are present.",
