{
  "purpose": "The function processes input parameters, converting them into a dictionary of path parameters for use in constructing URLs or requests.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'parameters', which can be a string or dictionary, and the imported module 'RequestInformation'.",
  "sinks": "The returned dictionary, which may be used in URL construction or request handling; no external untrusted data sinks are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'parameters' (string or dict) -> processed into 'result' dictionary -> returned for further use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. No dynamic code execution or external network calls are present. The use of a constant 'RAW_URL_KEY' from an imported module appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts either a string or dictionary as input. If input is a string, it is stored under a specific key in the result dictionary. If a dictionary, all key-value pairs are copied into the result. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or complex logic. It appears to be a utility function for request parameter handling without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign transformation of input parameters into a dictionary format suitable for URL or request processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
