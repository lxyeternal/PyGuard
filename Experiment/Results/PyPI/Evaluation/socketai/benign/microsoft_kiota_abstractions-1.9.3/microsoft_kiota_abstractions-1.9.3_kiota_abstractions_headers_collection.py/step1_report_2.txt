{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for managing HTTP headers, allowing addition, retrieval, removal, and inspection of headers and their values.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method parameters such as header names and header values. No external data sources are explicitly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that modify internal state (e.g., add, remove, try_add, add_all), but they do not directly output untrusted data or execute it. No code injection or unsafe evaluation is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs (header names/values) into internal data structures (_headers). No external or untrusted data flows into system commands, network, or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code performs standard collection management with proper input validation. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features. No network connections, file operations, or system calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a headers collection class, with methods for adding, retrieving, removing headers, and checking existence. All input validations are in place, preventing null or empty header names and values. The logic is standard for managing in-memory data structures, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or covert operations. The class does not perform any network, file, or system modifications that could be malicious. No malicious or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign header collection management class with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
