{
  "purpose": "The code defines a HeadersCollection class to manage HTTP headers, allowing adding, removing, and retrieving headers and their values.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method arguments such as header names and values, and from the internal _headers dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the internal _headers dictionary, and raises exceptions on invalid input; no direct data leaks or external system effects are observed.",
  "flows": "Headers are added, retrieved, or removed via method calls that manipulate the internal _headers data structure; no external network or system calls are made.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. The code performs standard collection management without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The class manages headers with straightforward data structures, with input validation and standard methods for adding, retrieving, and removing headers. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only notable aspect is the validation of header names and values, which is standard practice. No external network calls or file operations are present. The code is well-structured, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a headers collection with input validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low. It appears safe for inclusion in larger projects.",
