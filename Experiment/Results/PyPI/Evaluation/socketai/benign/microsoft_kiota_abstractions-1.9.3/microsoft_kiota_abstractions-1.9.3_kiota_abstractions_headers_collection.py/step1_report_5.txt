{
  "purpose": "The code defines a collection class for managing HTTP headers, allowing adding, retrieving, removing, and checking headers and their values.",
  "sources": "No explicit external data sources are read; the code operates solely on internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to security vulnerabilities; the class is for data management only.",
  "flows": "Data flows occur within method calls manipulating the internal _headers dictionary; no external or untrusted input processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. No malicious behavior such as network communication or data exfiltration is present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward implementation of a headers collection with methods to add, retrieve, remove, and check headers. It properly validates input parameters, converting header names to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The absence of network operations, file access, or environment variable misuse reduces the likelihood of malicious intent. The structure is clear, and no anomalies or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard header management class with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and suitable for use in larger applications without security concerns.",
