  "purpose": "A class managing HTTP headers with methods for adding, removing, and querying headers, ensuring case-insensitivity and validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for methods such as header names and values, internal _headers dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network interactions; internal data management only.",
  "flows": "Input validation leads to internal storage; no external data flow or unsafe operations observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an HTTP headers collection, performing validation, case-insensitive handling, and standard data operations. No external system interactions, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The logic is clear, and the methods operate on in-memory data structures with proper validation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured header management class with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate; however, given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is justified. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain use.",
