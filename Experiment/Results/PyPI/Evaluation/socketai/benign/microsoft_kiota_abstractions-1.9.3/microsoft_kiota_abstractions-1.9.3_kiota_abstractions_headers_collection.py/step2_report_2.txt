  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; the code manages headers without external effects. The security risk score is low but not zero, perhaps to account for potential future misuse or overlooked issues.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent, and the scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and standard data management.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning applies; the code is straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is deemed benign with standard header management.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher securityRisk score, possibly reflecting the general caution in supply chain assessments.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Clear conclusion of no malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly low, reflecting standard caution.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, standard risk for header management code)\n\n**My conclusion:** The scores across reports are consistent and justified based on the code's behavior. The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of an HTTP headers collection class with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Recommendation:** No adjustments needed. The overall assessment should remain at malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and risk = 0.1–0.2.",
