  "purpose": "Defines a collection class for managing HTTP headers, allowing adding, retrieving, removing, and checking headers.",
  "sources": "Initialization (__init__), methods that read header data (__get, try_get, get, contains), and parameters passed to methods (header_name, header_value, headers).",
  "sinks": "Methods that modify internal state (try_add, add, add_all, remove_value, remove, clear) and return header data (try_get, get, keys, count).",
  "flows": "Input parameters (header_name, header_value, headers) flow into methods, affecting internal _headers state. No external data sources or network interactions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code. No unusual code behavior observed; code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP headers collection class. It performs basic operations such as adding, retrieving, and removing headers, with proper input validation and case-insensitive handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious side effects. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. The class operates solely in-memory, with no external network or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard header collection implementation with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It does not perform any external actions, data leaks, or malicious modifications. The design appears safe and intended solely for header management.",
