{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'microsoft-kiota-abstractions' package installed in the environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata.version() for the package name 'microsoft-kiota-abstractions'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data transmission.",
  "flows": "The source (package version retrieval) does not lead to any sink or further processing; it's a simple read operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal; no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and retrieves the version of a specified package. This is a standard, safe operation for package version checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. It does not connect to external sources, execute code dynamically, or leak data.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign action—fetching the package version—and shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
