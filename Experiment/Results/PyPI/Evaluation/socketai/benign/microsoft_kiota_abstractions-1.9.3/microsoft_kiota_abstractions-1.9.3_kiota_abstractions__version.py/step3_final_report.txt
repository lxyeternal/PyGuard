  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'microsoft-kiota-abstractions' package using Python's importlib.metadata module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version via importlib.metadata.version('microsoft-kiota-abstractions').",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only reads package metadata without processing untrusted data or performing output operations.",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version() call -> Variable assignment to VERSION.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and retrieves the version of a specific package, storing it in a variable. This is a standard, benign operation with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The logic is simple, and there are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard operation for retrieving package version information. All reports correctly assess its safety, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
