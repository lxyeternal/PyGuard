  "purpose": "Define request configuration classes for an HTTP request handling system, including headers, options, and query parameters.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute initializations, and the __post_init__ method.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted data, execute system commands, or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines data structures and a deprecation warning.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated class with a warning; no malicious or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for request configurations, utilizing type hints and default initializations. It includes a deprecation warning for an older class. No input reading, no output to external systems, and no code injection points are present. The code is straightforward and follows standard design patterns. No anomalies or suspicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of request configuration classes with a deprecation warning. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
