{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration classes for HTTP requests, including headers, options, and query parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes, including type variables, warnings, and custom classes. No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code mainly declares classes and methods without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a deprecation warning in __post_init__, which is normal. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes for request configuration, with one inheriting from the other and issuing a deprecation warning. No external input handling, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be standard, well-structured Python class definitions for request configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on request configuration data structures without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
