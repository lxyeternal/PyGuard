  "purpose": "Define configuration classes for HTTP requests, including headers, options, and query parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines class attributes and default values.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; classes are primarily data containers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated class with a warning; no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines generic data classes for request configuration with default values and a deprecation warning. No data is read from external sources, nor are there any sinks that process untrusted data. The use of warnings for deprecation is benign. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward, with standard Python idioms, and appears to be a normal part of a request-building library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The deprecation warning indicates ongoing maintenance but does not introduce security concerns.",
