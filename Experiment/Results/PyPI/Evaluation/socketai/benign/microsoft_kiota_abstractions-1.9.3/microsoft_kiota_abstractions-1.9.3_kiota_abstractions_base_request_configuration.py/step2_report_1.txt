  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines two data classes (`RequestConfiguration` and `BaseRequestConfiguration`) intended for configuring HTTP requests.\n   - The classes include headers, options, and query parameters, with default initializations.\n   - The `BaseRequestConfiguration` class issues a deprecation warning in its `__post_init__` method, indicating it’s an older class being phased out.\n   - There are no external data inputs, no network or system commands, and no code execution beyond class definitions and warnings.\n\n2. **Potential Issues or Anomalies:**\n   - The use of a deprecation warning is standard practice; no malicious intent.\n   - No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as part of a larger SDK or library.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected; no code suggests malware.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities identified; the code is purely structural.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The deprecation warning is a benign indicator of API evolution, not a security concern.\n\n5. **Consistency & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores assigned in the reports (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed; the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured implementation of request configuration classes with a deprecation warning. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
