{
  "purpose": "Defines request configuration classes for HTTP requests, including headers, options, and query parameters, with a deprecation warning for an older class.",
  "sources": "Class initializations, import statements, and the __post_init__ method issuing a warning.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a deprecation warning in __post_init__, which is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes for request configuration, with default values and a deprecation warning. It contains no external data handling, network calls, or code execution. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard Python idioms. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The deprecation warning is a normal API evolution signal, not a security concern. The scores assigned in the reports (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are consistent with the benign and structural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of request configuration classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. The deprecation warning is benign. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero. The reports' evaluations are accurate and appropriate.",
