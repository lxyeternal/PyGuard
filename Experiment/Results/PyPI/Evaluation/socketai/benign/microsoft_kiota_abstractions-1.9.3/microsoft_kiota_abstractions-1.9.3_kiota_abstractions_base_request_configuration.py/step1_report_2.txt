{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration data structures for HTTP requests, including headers, options, and query parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes such as dataclasses, typing, warnings, and local modules (.headers_collection, .request_option). No external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines data classes and a deprecation warning.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a deprecation warning in __post_init__ with no malicious intent, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes for request configuration, including headers, options, and query parameters. It imports modules safely, and the only runtime action is issuing a deprecation warning. No external inputs, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior. The deprecation warning indicates an API change but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and safe, serving as part of a larger SDK or library. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks are identified.",
