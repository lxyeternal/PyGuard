  "purpose": "Define configuration data structures for HTTP requests, including headers, options, and query parameters.",
  "sources": "No input sources; class attribute initializations and imports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; classes are for data encapsulation only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. Use of deprecation warning in __post_init__ is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes, RequestConfiguration and BaseRequestConfiguration, for configuring HTTP requests. It imports standard libraries and local modules without any suspicious operations. The classes include type annotations and default values. The __post_init__ method in BaseRequestConfiguration issues a deprecation warning, which is typical for deprecating features. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or external data leaks. The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and intended for request configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of request configuration classes with no malicious or suspicious features. It primarily facilitates request setup and maintains compatibility through deprecation warnings. No security risks are present.",
