  "purpose": "Define an enumeration of standard HTTP methods for use in HTTP request handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static class attributes defining HTTP methods.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static enumeration without data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class 'Method' listing common HTTP methods with descriptive comments. It contains no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external data handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is static and purely declarative, serving as a utility for representing HTTP methods. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning high confidence scores (1), and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and clarity support the conclusion that it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enumeration of HTTP methods with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports and scores are consistent and appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
