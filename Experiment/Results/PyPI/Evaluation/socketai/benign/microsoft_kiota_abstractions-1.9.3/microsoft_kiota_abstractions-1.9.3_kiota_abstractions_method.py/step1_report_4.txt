{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for HTTP methods to be used in request handling or API interactions.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; the code defines a static Enum class.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or external interactions; purely a static class definition.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; no source-to-sink data paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Enum class that lists standard HTTP methods with descriptive comments. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no code execution, and no interactions with files, networks, or environment variables. The class appears to be a clean, self-contained definition meant for use in larger codebases. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign enumeration definition for HTTP methods with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
