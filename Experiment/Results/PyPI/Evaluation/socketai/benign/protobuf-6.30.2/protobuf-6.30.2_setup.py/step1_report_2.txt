{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and installs the Protocol Buffers Python package, including compiling C extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'google/protobuf/__init__.py', glob.glob calls to gather C source files for extensions, environment variables and system platform info for configuration.",
  "sinks": "exec() execution of version file content, glob.glob collection of C files, setup() invocation that compiles extensions.",
  "flows": "Reading version info -> exec() executes version file -> glob.glob collects C source files -> setup() compiles extensions with collected sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to dynamically execute contents of a source file for version info; potential risk if the source file is malicious or tampered with. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup, including reading version info via exec() and globbing C source files for extension compilation. exec() is generally safe here because it reads a controlled version file, but it could be risky if that file is compromised. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is standard for a setup script and appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with C extensions. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and uses exec() safely assuming the version file is controlled. No malware or security risks are evident.",
