  "sources": "Reading version info from 'google/protobuf/__init__.py', glob patterns for C source files, environment variables for platform-specific linker args.",
  "sinks": "exec() call for executing version file content, glob.glob() for file collection, setup() function for package installation.",
  "flows": "Reading version file -> Executing code in version file -> Collecting source files -> Running setup() with collected data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to read version, which could execute arbitrary code if the version file is maliciously modified.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version information by executing the contents of a version file, which can be risky if the file is tampered with. It uses glob to gather C source files for building extension modules, which is standard. The setup configuration appears typical for a Python C extension package, with platform-specific linker args. No suspicious network activity, hidden code, or malicious logic detected. The exec() call is a potential security concern but is a common pattern for version reading in setup scripts; if the version file is secure, the risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with C extensions. The only minor concern is the use of exec() to read version info, which could be exploited if the version file is compromised. No malware or malicious behavior detected. Overall, low security risk.",
