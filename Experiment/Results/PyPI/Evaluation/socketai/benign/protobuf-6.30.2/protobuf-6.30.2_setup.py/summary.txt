  "conclusion": "The setup script appears legitimate and standard for Python package configuration. The only potential security concern is the use of exec() to evaluate the version file, which is a known pattern but should be handled cautiously. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain compromise is detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect a low security risk."
