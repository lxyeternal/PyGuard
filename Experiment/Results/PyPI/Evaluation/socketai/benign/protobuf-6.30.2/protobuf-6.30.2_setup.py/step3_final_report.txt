{
  "purpose": "Configure the setup and build process for the protobuf Python package, including source file collection and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'google/protobuf/__init__.py' via exec(); globbing C source files for extension modules; system platform detection for build flags.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network activity or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "exec() reads and executes version file -> extracts __version__; glob patterns gather source files for extension compilation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to evaluate local version file, which could be risky if the file is malicious or tampered with; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks, with the notable pattern of executing code from a local version file. This pattern is common but can be risky if the source is compromised. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The glob patterns and system detection are typical. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the controlled use of exec() and the absence of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears legitimate and standard for Python package configuration. The only potential security concern is the use of exec() to evaluate the version file, which is a known pattern but should be handled cautiously. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain compromise is detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect a low security risk.",
