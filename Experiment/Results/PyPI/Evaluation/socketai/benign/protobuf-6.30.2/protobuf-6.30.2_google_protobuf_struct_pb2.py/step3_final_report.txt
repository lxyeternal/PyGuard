  "purpose": "This code is auto-generated protobuf schema code for Google's 'struct.proto', defining data serialization structures without performing any data processing or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version validation, descriptor registration, and serialized protobuf data",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle input, output, or external data",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs within this code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard, auto-generated protobuf schema with no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated protobuf schema for Google's 'struct.proto', performing version validation, descriptor registration, and message type setup. It contains no user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. All signals indicate this is a benign, standard protobuf definition file, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, auto-generated protobuf schema with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The static analysis confirms a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, consistent with the reports. No further action is necessary.",
