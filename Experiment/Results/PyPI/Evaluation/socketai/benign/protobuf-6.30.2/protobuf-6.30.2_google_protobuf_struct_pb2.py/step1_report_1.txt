{
  "purpose": "This code is generated protocol buffer code for Google's protobuf Struct message, used for serializing structured data.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.protobuf library, including descriptor, descriptor_pool, runtime_version, symbol_database, and internal builder; serialized file data for protobuf definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; code primarily defines data structures and serialization logic.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code sets up protobuf message descriptors and registration without executing data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated logic. The code is auto-generated, following standard protobuf generation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated protobuf definitions for google.protobuf.Struct and related message types. It includes import statements, version validation, message descriptor registration, and serialized protobuf schema data. No user input handling, external data reading, or network communication exists. All components follow standard protobuf code generation practices without signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard, auto-generated protobuf schema code with no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines data serialization structures for protobuf messages.",
