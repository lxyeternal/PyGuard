  "purpose": "Generated protocol buffer code for Google's protobuf 'struct.proto' schema, used for serializing structured data.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.protobuf modules, serialized file data for descriptor creation.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data sources or outputs are present in this static code.",
  "flows": "Initialization of descriptors and registration within protobuf symbol database; no runtime data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be auto-generated and standard for protobuf schema definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated protobuf serialization/deserialization code, including descriptors, message classes, and initialization routines. It imports necessary modules, validates protobuf runtime version, and registers descriptors. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or credential handling observed. No anomalies or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard auto-generated protobuf schema code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is used for data serialization within applications and does not contain malicious intent.",
