  "purpose": "Defines a metaclass and helper functions for creating protocol message classes at runtime for Google's Protocol Buffers implementation in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports modules 'warnings', 'google.protobuf.message_factory', and 'google.protobuf.symbol_database'. No input reading from external sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network connections, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no source-to-sink data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard library imports and setup for Protocol Buffers in Python, including defining a metaclass and a cache dictionary. There are no signs of data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. It appears to be a typical, well-documented implementation component. No code injections, network communications, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard part of Google's Protocol Buffers library for Python, used to create message classes dynamically. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
