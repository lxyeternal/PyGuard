{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up namespace declaration for a Python package using pkg_resources or pkgutil",
  "sources": "Import statements (__import__('pkg_resources') and __import__('pkgutil')) and __path__ assignment",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks",
  "flows": "Imports are conditional; no data flows from external sources to sensitive functions",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ for dynamic imports is common in namespace packages; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace for a Python package. It first tries to import 'pkg_resources' to declare the namespace, and if that fails, it extends __path__ with 'pkgutil'. Both are standard mechanisms for namespace packages in Python. No user input handling, no external data sources, and no obfuscated or malicious code detected. The code is straightforward and intended for package namespace setup, which is a legitimate use case.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard namespace package setup using well-known Python techniques. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
