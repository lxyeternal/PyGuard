{
  "purpose": "This code is used to declare a namespace package in Python, enabling the distribution of a package across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's namespace via __name__ and __path__ variables, which are implicitly provided by Python when the module is imported.",
  "sinks": "The code uses __import__ to load 'pkg_resources' or 'pkgutil', which are standard libraries or common third-party libraries; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to import 'pkg_resources' to declare a namespace, and if that fails, it extends the package path using 'pkgutil'. The flow is straightforward: import, try-except, extend path.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard namespace declaration patterns used in Python packaging. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The usage of __import__ with string literals is common in dynamic imports, but not suspicious here.",
  "analysis": "The code first tries to import 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' on __name__, which is a typical pattern for namespace packages. If 'pkg_resources' is unavailable, it falls back to extending __path__ using 'pkgutil'. Both modules are standard for namespace handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The code is minimal and aligns with common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for setting up namespace packages in Python and does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate package management code.",
