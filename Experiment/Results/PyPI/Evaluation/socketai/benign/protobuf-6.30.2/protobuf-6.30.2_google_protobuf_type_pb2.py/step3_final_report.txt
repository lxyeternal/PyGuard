{
  "purpose": "This code is an auto-generated Python module from the protobuf compiler for 'google/protobuf/type.proto'. It defines protobuf message descriptors, imports necessary modules, and registers message types for serialization/deserialization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads embedded serialized descriptor data and imports protobuf runtime modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions; the code only registers static descriptors.",
  "flows": "The flow involves loading serialized descriptor data into protobuf message classes during module import; no runtime data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard protobuf generated module containing message descriptors and registration logic. It imports protobuf modules, validates runtime version, and loads embedded serialized descriptor data into message classes. There are no runtime data flows involving external input, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns. The code's purpose is solely to define data structures for protobuf serialization/deserialization. The scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, security risk 0, with high confidence (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, auto-generated protobuf schema definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. It poses no supply chain risk or security threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
