  "purpose": "Provides helper APIs for converting between protobuf Timestamp objects and various formats such as JSON strings, epoch units, and datetime objects.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in functions: string inputs for from_json_string; numeric epoch values for from_microseconds, from_milliseconds, from_nanoseconds, from_seconds; system time in from_current_time; protobuf Timestamp objects in conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions convert data internally without external system interactions or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings, numeric values, system time) flows into protobuf conversion methods, producing timestamp objects or formatted strings; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs; parsing untrusted JSON strings could potentially cause errors but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility wrapper around protobuf Timestamp methods, performing safe conversions. It relies on standard libraries and protobuf API, with no network, file, or environment manipulations. The only minor point is parsing untrusted date strings, which is a standard operation and not malicious. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for timestamp conversions with no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
