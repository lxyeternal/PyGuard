  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between various date/time formats and Google's protobuf Timestamp object.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function arguments such as 'value' (date string), 'micros', 'millis', 'nanos', 'seconds', and the current datetime.",
  "sinks": "Returning Timestamp objects, converting Timestamps to string formats or numeric epoch values, and converting Timestamps to datetime objects.",
  "flows": "Input data (date strings or numeric epoch times) -> create Timestamp objects via dedicated functions -> convert Timestamps to strings, numeric epoch values, or datetime objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code uses standard libraries and protobuf methods without any obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions for handling Timestamp conversions. Each function creates or converts Timestamp objects using well-documented protobuf methods. The use of 'FromJsonString', 'FromMicroseconds', etc., are standard and do not introduce security risks. No untrusted input is directly used in dangerous operations like system calls, network access, or data leakage. The functions operate solely on provided arguments and do not process external data streams or environment variables that could be exploited. There is no suspicious or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of timestamp utility functions, safe and free of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on protobuf's well-defined methods and performs simple data conversions without external side effects or data leakage vectors.",
