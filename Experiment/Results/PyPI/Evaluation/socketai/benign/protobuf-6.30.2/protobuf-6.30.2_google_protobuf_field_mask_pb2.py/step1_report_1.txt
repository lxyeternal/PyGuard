{
  "purpose": "Generated protocol buffer code for google.protobuf.field_mask.proto",
  "sources": "Imports from google.protobuf library, serialized file content, descriptor pool",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data could cause harm; standard protobuf generation code",
  "flows": "Imports and descriptor registration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Generated code includes a comment indicating 'DO NOT EDIT' and source annotations; no suspicious or obfuscated code present; no hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated by the protobuf compiler, explicitly stated by comments and standard code patterns. It imports protobuf modules, performs runtime version validation, registers descriptors, and builds message classes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious data flows. The code is typical of protobuf generated files intended for serialization/deserialization of defined message types.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, auto-generated protobuf code snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is used for defining and handling protobuf message types safely.",
