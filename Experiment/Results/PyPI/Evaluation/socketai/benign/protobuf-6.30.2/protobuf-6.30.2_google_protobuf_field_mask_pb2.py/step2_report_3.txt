  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is auto-generated protobuf code; no malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The report correctly states that this is standard generated code.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This aligns with the analysis.\n   - **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; standard protobuf code with no suspicious behavior.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Consistent.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Again, standard protobuf code, no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5? The report states risk=0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** No malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Consistent.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; standard protobuf code.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n   - **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is auto-generated protobuf code with no malicious intent.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- The risk score is appropriately low (0 or 0.5). Since the code is standard, a risk score of 0 is suitable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk from this code)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.",
