{
  "purpose": "Generated protocol buffer code for the google.protobuf.field_mask.proto definition, used for serializing and deserializing data related to field masks in protobuf messages.",
  "sources": "Reads imported modules from google.protobuf (descriptor, descriptor_pool, runtime_version, symbol_database, internal.builder). Uses AddSerializedFile to process protobuf descriptor data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points are limited to data processing functions such as AddSerializedFile, but these are standard protobuf functions used for code generation and data serialization, not for handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> Validates runtime version -> Adds serialized protobuf file -> Builds message and enum descriptors -> Sets descriptor options.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be auto-generated protobuf code with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. Uses standard protobuf patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated protobuf code, including standard imports and functions for handling protobuf descriptors and message definitions. It validates runtime version, loads descriptors from serialized data, and sets descriptor options. All operations are typical for protobuf generated code, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or suspicious operations. The data used for AddSerializedFile is a static byte string representing protobuf descriptors, not untrusted input. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard auto-generated protobuf code with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical protobuf descriptor processing with no anomalies or dangerous behaviors.",
