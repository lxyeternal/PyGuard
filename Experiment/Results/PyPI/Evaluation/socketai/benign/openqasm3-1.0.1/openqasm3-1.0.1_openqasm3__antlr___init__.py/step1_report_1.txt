{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically loads and manages version-specific ANTLR parser files for OpenQASM 3 files, ensuring the correct parser version is used based on the installed ANTLR runtime.",
  "sources": "Reads the installed ANTLR runtime version via importlib_metadata or importlib.metadata, and checks for available parser files in the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Uses importlib to dynamically load version-specific parser modules; no data sinks or external data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> Checks filesystem for parser files -> Raises ImportError if not found -> Dynamically loads parser modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code performs standard dynamic module loading based on runtime version.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages version-specific module loading for parser files generated by ANTLR, using standard Python libraries. It includes version detection, filesystem checks, and dynamic import logic. No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or suspicious code constructs are present. It raises appropriate errors if necessary files are missing. All operations are consistent with legitimate package management and dynamic import patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate version management and dynamic module loader for ANTLR-generated parser files. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior detected.",
