  "purpose": "Setup and dynamic loading of ANTLR-generated parser files for OpenQASM 3 based on runtime version.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version detection (`_version`), directory checks (`_resolved_dir`, `_antlr_dir`), and module import paths (`importlib`, `pathlib`, `sys`).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Version information is retrieved from package metadata, used to determine directory paths, and dynamic module loading redirects to version-specific parser files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code primarily handles version checks, directory validation, and dynamic module loading.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and determining the Python version. It retrieves the version of `antlr4_python3_runtime` to identify the appropriate parser directory. It then verifies the presence of parser files matching this version, raising errors if not found. A custom `MetaPathFinder` class redirects module lookups to version-specific implementations, ensuring correct parser loading. The module's import path is modified to include this custom finder, which influences subsequent module resolution. The overall structure is straightforward, focusing on version-based module management. No malicious or suspicious activity is present; the logic is standard for dynamic version handling and import management.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs version detection, directory validation, and dynamic module import redirection to ensure compatibility with the correct parser version. No malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a safe, purpose-specific module for managing parser imports based on runtime version.",
