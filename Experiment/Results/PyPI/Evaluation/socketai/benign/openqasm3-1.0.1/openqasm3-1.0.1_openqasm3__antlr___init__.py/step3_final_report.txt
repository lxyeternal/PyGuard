  "purpose": "Manage version-specific ANTLR parser files for OpenQASM 3 by verifying presence and dynamically loading appropriate modules based on installed runtime version.",
  "sources": "Reads version info via importlib_metadata or importlib.metadata; filesystem checks for parser files; module import via importlib machinery.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import mechanisms could lead to loading malicious or tampered parser files if filesystem is compromised.",
  "flows": "Version detection -> filesystem validation -> setting up import hook -> dynamic module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Standard version management and import hook setup; no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical version detection, filesystem validation, and dynamic import setup for version-specific parser modules. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The reliance on filesystem integrity introduces a potential security concern if parser files are maliciously altered, which is acknowledged by the risk score of 0.2. The code is straightforward and aligns with common plugin/version management patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and standard for managing version-specific parser modules. No malware or obfuscation detected. The slight security risk score of 0.2 appropriately reflects the dependency on filesystem trust, but no active threats are present.",
