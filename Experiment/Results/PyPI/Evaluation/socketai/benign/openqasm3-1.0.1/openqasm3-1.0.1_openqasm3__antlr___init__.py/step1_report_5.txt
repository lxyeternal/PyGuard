{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically loads ANTLR-generated parser files for OpenQASM 3 based on the installed runtime version, managing module imports and version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads the installed version of the 'antlr4_python3_runtime' package and the presence of specific parser files in the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Imports modules and executes code related to parsing; potential risk if imported modules are malicious or tampered with.",
  "flows": "Version check -> Filesystem verification -> Dynamic import of version-specific parser files -> Module importation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code uses dynamic imports and version management, which is standard for plugin/module loading.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the installed ANTLR runtime version, verifies the presence of corresponding parser files, and sets up a custom module finder to load versioned modules dynamically. The import logic is based on standard Python importlib mechanisms, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The filesystem check prevents execution if required parser files are missing, reducing risk. The code does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or system modifications. The approach is typical for version-dependent module loading and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a version-aware module loader for ANTLR-generated parsers, with no apparent malicious behavior or security issues. It employs standard techniques for dynamic importing and version management, and there are no signs of malware or suspicious activity.",
