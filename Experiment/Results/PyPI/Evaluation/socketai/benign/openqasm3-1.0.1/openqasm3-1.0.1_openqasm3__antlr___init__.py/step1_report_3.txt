  "purpose": "This code sets up dynamic loading of ANTLR-generated parser files for OpenQASM 3, ensuring the correct version is used based on the installed runtime.",
  "sources": "Reads system version info (_version), module imports, filesystem checks for parser files, and package metadata.",
  "targets": "Loader class, import mechanisms, and module imports, which could load malicious code if tampered with or if malicious files are present.",
  "flows": "System version info -> Filesystem checks -> Import hooks -> Module imports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; dynamic import hooking is common but can be exploited if the filesystem or package is maliciously modified. No suspicious external network activity or reverse shells. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically determines the installed ANTLR version and attempts to locate corresponding parser files in the filesystem. If missing, it raises ImportError. It implements a custom MetaPathFinder to redirect imports of specific modules to version-specific files, ensuring compatibility. The approach relies on filesystem integrity and proper package setup. No external network activity, no code injection, no data exfiltration observed. The import hook logic is standard for plugin-like systems but could be exploited if malicious files are present in the filesystem. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for version-specific module loading with no apparent malicious intent. The main risk is dependency or filesystem tampering, which could cause malicious code execution if the parser files are compromised. Overall, the code appears secure and legitimate.",
