{
  "purpose": "The code defines precedence levels for various AST node types and binary operators in a parser or interpreter, likely related to a language or expression evaluation system.",
  "sources": "Reads AST nodes and their classes, specifically 'ast' module classes and instances such as 'BinaryExpression' and 'BinaryOperator'.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'ast' module classes as source nodes but does not include any data sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Retrieves precedence values based on node class/type; no untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code simply maps node types to precedence values and performs lookups.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up precedence mappings for AST nodes and binary operators for expression parsing. It relies on class type checks and a dictionary for precedence retrieval. The 'precedence' function raises an error if an unknown node type is encountered, which is appropriate for debugging or input validation. No external inputs, network access, or suspicious behavior present. The code appears to be a standard parser utility component with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of precedence rules for an AST parser, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It solely involves mapping node types to precedence levels and safely handling unknown node types.",
