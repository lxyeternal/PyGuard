{
  "purpose": "This code defines precedence levels for various AST nodes related to expressions in a programming language parser or interpreter, facilitating correct parenthesis placement in expressions based on operator precedence.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it operates solely on AST node objects passed to the 'precedence' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data; the code does not perform I/O, network operations, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input: AST node objects are passed into 'precedence'; output: an integer precedence value is returned. No external data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, defining static mappings and a simple function.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module 'ast' and defines precedence mappings for various AST node classes and binary operators. The function 'precedence' retrieves the precedence level for a given node, raising an error if the node type is unrecognized. The logic is standard for expression parsing and contains no dynamic code execution, network access, or data handling. The structure and purpose are clear and typical for syntax analysis modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard component of an expression parser or language interpreter, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely maps AST nodes to precedence levels without external interactions or secret handling.",
