  "purpose": "Define precedence levels for AST nodes and operators in a parser or interpreter context.",
  "sources": "AST node classes and operator definitions used within the precedence lookup functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the function only reads node types and operators for lookup.",
  "flows": "Input node or operator type flows into the precedence function, which retrieves corresponding precedence from static tables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is static, straightforward, and lacks suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an 'ast' module, defines static dictionaries mapping AST node classes and operators to precedence levels, and provides a function to retrieve precedence. It performs type checks and raises an exception for unknown nodes. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity is present. The code is a benign utility for parsing, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of precedence mapping for AST nodes. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues. The scores are consistent with its benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and security risk at 0.",
