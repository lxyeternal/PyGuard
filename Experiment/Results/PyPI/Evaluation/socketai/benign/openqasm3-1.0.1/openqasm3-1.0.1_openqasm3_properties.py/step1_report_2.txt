{
  "purpose": "This code defines precedence levels for various AST nodes related to expression parsing in a hypothetical or domain-specific language, likely for use in parsing or formatting source code.",
  "sources": "The code reads definitions and instances of AST nodes and operators from the imported 'ast' module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or execute untrusted data; it only performs lookups and returns precedence values based on node types.",
  "flows": "Input (AST nodes) flows into the 'precedence' function, which then retrieves precedence values from predefined tables, with no external output or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns are present. The code strictly involves static lookups and definitions, with no dynamic execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes precedence values for AST nodes used in parsing. It includes dictionaries mapping node classes and operators to precedence levels. The 'precedence' function retrieves the precedence for a node, raising an exception if the node type is unrecognized. There is no user input, no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The code appears to be straightforward and static in nature, serving a utility role in expression parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for managing precedence in an AST parsing context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious operations. It is a standard implementation of precedence lookup tables with no security concerns.",
