{
  "purpose": "Define precedence levels for various AST nodes in a QASM-like language parser.",
  "sources": "The code reads AST node classes, node instances, and a dictionary for operator precedence.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows or causes data leaks.",
  "flows": "The function 'precedence' takes an AST node and returns its precedence based on type or operator.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an AST module, defines precedence mappings for AST node types, and a function that retrieves precedence values based on node class or operator. It uses straightforward dictionary lookups and type checks, with no dynamic execution or external data processing. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code's structure is standard for such tasks, with no obfuscated or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of precedence determination for an AST, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
