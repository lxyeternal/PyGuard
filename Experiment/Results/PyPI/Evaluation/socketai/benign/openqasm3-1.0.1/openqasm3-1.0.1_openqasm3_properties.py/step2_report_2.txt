  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is a straightforward implementation of precedence mapping for AST nodes in a parser context.\n   - It imports an 'ast' module, defines precedence tables, and provides a function to retrieve precedence based on node type.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or untrusted input processing is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The function raises an exception if an unrecognized node type is encountered, which is appropriate for debugging.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment: they identify the code as benign, static, and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent in the reports.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The reports' conclusions align with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n3. **Scores Given & Justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1.0), justified by the straightforward static analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Justification:**\n   - The code's purpose is to map AST nodes to precedence levels, a common utility in parsers.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or external vulnerabilities.\n   - The only point of concern could be the unrecognized node raising an exception, but this is a typical validation approach, not a security flaw.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - They focus on static analysis, which is appropriate here.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores & Analysis:**\n   - The scores align with the analysis; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Estimated scores based on the overall review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard utility for managing precedence in an AST parser. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No security concerns are present, and the implementation appears correct and safe.",
