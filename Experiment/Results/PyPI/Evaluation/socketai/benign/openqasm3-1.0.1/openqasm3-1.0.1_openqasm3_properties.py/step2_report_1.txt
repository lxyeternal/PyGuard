  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward utility for defining precedence levels for AST nodes in a parser or interpreter context.\n- It involves static dictionaries, type checks, and a simple function to retrieve precedence.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are evident.\n- The code does not process untrusted input beyond the 'node' parameter, which is expected in such utility functions.\n- The reported malware score of 0 aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is benign, with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The logic is straightforward and correct for its purpose.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — accurate, code is clear.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no security concerns identified.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The `raise ValueError` on unknown node types is appropriate for debugging, but in production, it might be better to handle unknown nodes gracefully or log warnings. However, this does not constitute a security issue.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **The code is a benign, standard implementation of precedence lookup for AST nodes.**  \n- **No malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues are present.**  \n- **Scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a minimal potential for future issues if node types change or are extended, but currently negligible)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and suitable for its purpose. The reports correctly identify its benign nature.",
