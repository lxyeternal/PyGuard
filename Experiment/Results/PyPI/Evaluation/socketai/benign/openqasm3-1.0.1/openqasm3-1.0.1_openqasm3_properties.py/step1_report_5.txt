{
  "purpose": "Define precedence levels for different AST nodes representing expressions in a custom language or parser framework.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported 'ast' module, specifically various classes and dictionaries defining operators and literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The 'precedence' function determines precedence based on node class/type, referencing predefined tables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of precedence logic.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes precedence levels for different AST node types, using predefined tables. It handles specific classes in '_PRECEDENCE_TABLE' and binary operators in '_BINARY_PRECEDENCE_TABLE'. The 'precedence' function returns the precedence level for a given node, raising an error if the node type is unrecognized. The code is clean, structured, and avoids dynamic execution or obfuscation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected, and no external data handling or sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for handling precedence of AST nodes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply maps AST node types to precedence levels for use in expression parsing or formatting.",
