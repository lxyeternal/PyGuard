  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward precedence mapping for AST nodes, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is static, does not process untrusted data, and contains no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a utility for precedence determination with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No dynamic code, external data, or malicious patterns. The code is static and benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Confirms the code's purpose as a parser utility with no suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No external data handling, no code execution, no signs of malware.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, describes a standard precedence mapping with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** Static, safe, and straightforward.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, a standard precedence utility with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No dynamic execution, no external data, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code does not exhibit any behavior consistent with malware (e.g., code injection, external data handling, obfuscation, or malicious patterns). **I concur with malware = 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, and the code is clear and straightforward. **Obfuscation is not present.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the above, the risk score should also be 0, as there's no indication of security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code's purpose is purely to map AST node types to precedence levels, which is a common utility in parsers.\n- No dynamic code execution, external inputs, or network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- The code is static, well-structured, and typical for its intended purpose.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.",
