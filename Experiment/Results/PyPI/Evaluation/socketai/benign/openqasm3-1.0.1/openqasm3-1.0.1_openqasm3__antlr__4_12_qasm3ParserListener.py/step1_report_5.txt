{
  "purpose": "This code defines a parse tree listener for a QASM3 parser generated by ANTLR, used for processing quantum assembly language.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'antlr4' and the conditional import of 'qasm3Parser', which is used as the parser class. No input or data reading is evident within this code fragment.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data flows or could lead to security issues; the code mainly defines no-op event handler methods.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as all methods are placeholders (pass) with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class and method definitions with empty method bodies. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated class from ANTLR that acts as a listener for parse tree events. All methods are stubs (pass) intended for user implementation. The import statements include conditional importing based on module context. No external data handling, code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely structural, with no embedded logic or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a boilerplate parse tree listener generated by ANTLR for QASM3 language. It contains no malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity. It is intended as a template for further implementation. Overall security risk is minimal, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
