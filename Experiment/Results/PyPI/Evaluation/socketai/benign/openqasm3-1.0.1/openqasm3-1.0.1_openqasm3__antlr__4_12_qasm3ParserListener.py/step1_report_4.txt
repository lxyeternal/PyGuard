{
  "purpose": "The code defines a parser listener class for a QASM3 parser, intended for use with ANTLR-generated parse trees, and contains placeholder methods for parse tree events.",
  "sources": "The source code itself, primarily method definitions that are invoked during parse tree traversal.",
  "sinks": "The methods themselves do not perform any data processing or sensitive operations; they are placeholders.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted input handling are present in the code; it serves as a structural scaffold with no actual logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of method definitions with 'pass' statements, typical of auto-generated parser skeletons. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated skeleton for a parse tree listener, with no implementation details or logic. It imports necessary modules and defines a class with methods for parse events. The structure is standard for parser listener classes. No malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code is intended to be extended with actual logic in subclasses or during implementation, not as-is.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated parse tree listener skeleton for QASM3 parsing, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and only serves as a structural foundation for further development.",
