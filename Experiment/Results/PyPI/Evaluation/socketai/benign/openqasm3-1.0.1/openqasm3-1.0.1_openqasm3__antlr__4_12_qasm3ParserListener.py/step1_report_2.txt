{
  "purpose": "This code defines a listener class for a parse tree generated by qasm3Parser, used for parsing QASM3 quantum assembly language. Its main purpose is to provide hooks (methods) for entering and exiting various parse tree nodes, but currently all methods are placeholders.",
  "sources": "The code imports the antlr4 library and conditionally imports qasm3Parser. It does not read input or data dynamically during execution; it defines a class structure for parsing logic.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are present. The class methods do not perform any data output, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no active data flows; the class methods are empty, serving as hooks for parser events but do not process or propagate data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. It appears to be a standard parser listener template with no unusual or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a boilerplate generated from ANTLR 4.12.0 for qasm3Parser, defining a listener class with all methods as placeholders (pass statements). The imports and class definitions are standard for such parser listener templates. No runtime data handling, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. It is purely structural and intended for further implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign boilerplate template for a parser listener, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides method hooks for parse tree traversal, currently unimplemented.",
