{
  "purpose": "Auto-generated parser listener class for qasm3 language, serving as a scaffold for further implementation.",
  "sources": "No data sources; methods are placeholders with no data input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, external communication, or side effects present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; all methods are empty and do not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard boilerplate with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated, structurally simple parser listener with all methods stubbed out. It contains no operational logic, data handling, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, boilerplate nature of the code. High confidence is justified given the straightforward, auto-generated structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, auto-generated scaffold for qasm3 parsing with no malicious intent or security risks. It is suitable for extension without concern for security issues.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
