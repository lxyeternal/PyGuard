  "purpose": "Implementations of AST visitor and transformer classes for QASM nodes, enabling traversal and modification of the abstract syntax tree.",
  "sources": "Node attributes within QASMNode objects during traversal and transformation.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or malicious effects identified.",
  "flows": "Traversal from source nodes through visit/generic_visit methods to potential node modifications, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard AST visitor and transformer classes, following common patterns derived from Python's ast module. The visit method dispatches to specific handlers or generic_visit, which recursively processes node attributes. The transformer modifies nodes in-place, handling lists and nested nodes appropriately. No external inputs, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs typical AST operations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of AST traversal and transformation classes for QASM nodes. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
