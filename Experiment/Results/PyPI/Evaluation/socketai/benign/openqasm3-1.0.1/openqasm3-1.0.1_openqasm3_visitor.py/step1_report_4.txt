  "purpose": "Define base classes for visiting and transforming AST nodes related to OpenQASM 3.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and classes (`typing`, `.ast.QASMNode`)",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or external outputs",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is about structure and traversal of AST nodes, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed; standard AST visitor pattern implementation",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes, QASMVisitor and QASMTransformer, for traversing and modifying ASTs. It uses standard design patterns similar to Python's ast module. The methods involve calling visitor functions, recursive traversal, and node modification, all in a controlled manner. No external data input/output, network activity, or obfuscated code present. The purpose appears to be for AST analysis or transformation in a compiler or interpreter context. No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a standard, safe implementation of AST visitor and transformer classes for OpenQASM 3. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
