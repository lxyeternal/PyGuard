  "purpose": "Define base classes for visiting and transforming an abstract syntax tree (AST) of QASM nodes.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library and local 'ast' module; class methods accessing node attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe attribute modifications in 'generic_visit' methods.",
  "flows": "Visit methods access node attributes, possibly modifying or traversing them.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or suspicious obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard visitor pattern for AST traversal and modification. It uses typical Python class structures and type annotations. The 'visit' method dynamically calls specific visitor functions or defaults to 'generic_visit'. The 'generic_visit' method recursively traverses node attributes, modifying them if they are lists or nodes. There are no external inputs, outputs, or network interactions. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign implementation of AST visitors and transformers for QASM nodes. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a standard pattern implementation with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
