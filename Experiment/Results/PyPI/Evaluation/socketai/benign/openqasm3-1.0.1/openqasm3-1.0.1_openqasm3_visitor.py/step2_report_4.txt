  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a straightforward implementation of AST visitors and transformers, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The reasoning aligns with standard patterns; no logical flaws detected.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which are appropriate. Security risk is 0, consistent with benign analysis.\n- **Justification:** The code does not perform any external communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. It is a typical AST utility class.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, it describes standard AST traversal code.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No external data handling or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Again, a standard pattern.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The analysis correctly states that the code is typical for AST processing.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a standard AST visitor/transformer.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.1, which is minimal and acceptable.\n- **Justification:** No external or malicious activity; the slight security risk score might reflect inherent risks in attribute modification, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Standard AST traversal pattern.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. No signs of malicious behavior are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Consistently low or zero, which is appropriate given the benign, utility nature of the code.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0** — The code is a standard AST utility with no security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate. The code is a benign, standard implementation of AST visitors and transformers, with no security concerns or malicious behavior.",
