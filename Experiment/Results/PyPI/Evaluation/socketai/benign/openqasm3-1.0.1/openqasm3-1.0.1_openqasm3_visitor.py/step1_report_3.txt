{
  "purpose": "Define base classes for traversing and transforming abstract syntax trees (AST) of QASM code.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and class definitions, especially the import of QASMNode and the class methods that process AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations; no external calls or I/O are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows through AST node traversal and transformation methods, invoking visitor functions on AST nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or unusual behavior observed. The classes are typical visitor patterns for AST processing.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard visitor and transformer classes for AST manipulation, similar to Python's ast module. It involves method dispatch based on node class names and recursive visiting. No external inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure is typical for AST processing and does not include obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of AST visitors and transformers for a QASM parser, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign utility for AST processing.",
