  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe a standard visitor pattern implementation converting AST nodes into textual OpenQASM 3 code.\n   - No report indicates any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code snippets.\n   - The code's primary function is serialization, with no external system interactions beyond writing to streams.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are identified in any report.\n   - The reasoning in all reports aligns with the code's purpose and structure.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature described.\n   - Obfuscation scores are also 0, indicating no obfuscation or hidden malicious code.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), matching the thorough analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - No report suggests any reason to assign a risk score higher than 0.5.\n   - The code operates solely as a code generator, with no network, file system, or command execution.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malware or malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports base their assessments on the code's content and structure, not on assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code as a straightforward AST serializer.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\nGiven the detailed reviews, the code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of an AST-to-text converter for OpenQASM 3. The utility functions and visitor class are typical for such tasks, with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely for serialization, with no external system interactions, no embedded secrets, and no obfuscation. It operates within a controlled scope, converting AST nodes into code with standard patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and free from malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
