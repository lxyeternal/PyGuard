{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python class for converting an AST representation of OpenQASM 3 into textual code, providing detailed formatting and output control.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the AST nodes passed to visitor methods, especially from external or user-defined AST nodes such as program statements, expressions, and declarations.",
  "sinks": "Output sinks are the stream object (io.TextIOBase) where the generated code is written; no untrusted data is directly written from outside sources, only the AST content is converted and written.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves reading AST nodes (sources) during visit methods, processing their content, and writing formatted code to the output stream (sinks). There are no external data flows or untrusted inputs affecting the output directly.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs. The code uses standard visitor pattern, normal formatting, and routine string operations. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a visitor pattern for serializing AST nodes of OpenQASM 3 into text. It utilizes typical formatting functions, context management, and node-specific visit methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is consistent with a utility library for code generation, with no anomalous or malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, well-structured code generator for OpenQASM 3 ASTs. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It solely focuses on converting AST nodes into textual representations. The overall security risk is negligible.",
