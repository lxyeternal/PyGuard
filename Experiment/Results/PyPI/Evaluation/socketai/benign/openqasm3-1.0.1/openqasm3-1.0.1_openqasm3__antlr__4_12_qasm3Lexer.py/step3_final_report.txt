  "purpose": "Lexer class generated by ANTLR for tokenizing QASM3 source code.",
  "sources": "Serialized ATN array deserialization, input stream fed into lexer.",
  "sinks": "Tokenization process, no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into deserialization and tokenization, resulting in token stream.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; large serialized ATN array is standard for generated lexers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated ANTLR lexer for QASM3, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It deserializes static data, initializes DFA states, and defines token types based on grammar rules. No external communication, code injection, or runtime malicious behavior is present. The large serialized ATN is typical and does not indicate obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk, which aligns with the static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe lexer component for QASM3 language parsing. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's static, generated nature.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
