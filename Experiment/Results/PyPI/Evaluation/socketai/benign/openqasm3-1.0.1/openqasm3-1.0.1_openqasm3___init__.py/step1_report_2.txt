{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python package for handling OpenQASM 3 AST, parsing, and manipulation tools.",
  "sources": "No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are read; module imports are static.",
  "sinks": "No sink points identified; no untrusted data handling or data leak points.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; only module imports and conditional imports based on existing packages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The try-except for optional parser import is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines module exports, version, and conditional import logic for the 'antlr4' package. It attempts to import 'antlr4' and, if successful, imports additional parser components. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling observed. No malicious or suspicious code segments. Overall, the code appears to be a benign package setup with optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "This package is a standard open-source library for OpenQASM 3 AST handling with no signs of malicious behavior. The only noteworthy aspect is the optional import of 'antlr4' which is handled safely. No security risks identified.",
