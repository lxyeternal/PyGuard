{
  "purpose": "Provide reference implementation and tools for parsing and manipulating OpenQASM 3 programs, including AST representation and parser integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements, module documentation, try-except block for optional parser import.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external data handling found.",
  "flows": "Code reads from standard modules, potentially imports 'antlr4' if available, then conditionally imports parser modules.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of 'antlr4' based on availability; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines module metadata, imports necessary submodules, and conditionally imports the parser if 'antlr4' is available. The try-except block is standard for optional dependencies. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The structure appears typical for a Python package setup. No anomalies or malicious code elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script for a Python library related to OpenQASM 3 parsing. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is clean, well-structured, and typical for open-source package setup with optional dependencies.",
