{
  "purpose": "This code defines the abstract syntax tree (AST) classes for OpenQASM 3 programs, representing the syntax and structure of quantum assembly language in a Python class hierarchy.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or inputs are read at runtime; the code only defines data structures for parsing and representing source code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data is written, transmitted over a network, or causes side effects such as file access or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists, as the code only declares data classes and enums without runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward data class definitions with no suspicious patterns, hidden code, or obfuscated constructs. It contains no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and enum declarations for representing an AST structure for OpenQASM 3. language. It uses standard Python features such as dataclasses, type annotations, and enum definitions. There are no functions performing I/O, network operations, or executing code based on external input. All components are purely structural, designed for parsing or processing OpenQASM source code. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are present. No signs of obfuscation or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data structure definitions for representing OpenQASM 3 programs in Python. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for use as part of a parser, compiler, or analysis tool for quantum assembly language.",
