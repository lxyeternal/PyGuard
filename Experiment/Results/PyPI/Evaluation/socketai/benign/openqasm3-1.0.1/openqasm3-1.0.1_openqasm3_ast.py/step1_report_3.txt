{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract syntax tree (AST) structure for OpenQASM 3 programs, enabling parsing, analysis, and processing of quantum assembly code.",
  "sources": "None (code is a data structure definition; no external input handling observed).",
  "sinks": "None (no data sinks or external outputs observed).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow, external data processing, or untrusted data handling observed).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified. No unusual code constructs or obfuscated code present. Code primarily consists of data class definitions for AST nodes, with no runtime logic or external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for various AST nodes used to parse and represent OpenQASM 3 source files. It includes enumerations for language keywords and types, and dataclasses for syntax elements such as statements, expressions, types, and program structure. There are no functions that execute or manipulate data in a way that could introduce malicious behavior. The code lacks any network activity, system calls, or data leakage mechanisms. The design appears to be a standard AST schema for a domain-specific language, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code constitutes a standard, well-structured set of data class definitions for representing the syntax of OpenQASM 3 programs. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The likelihood of malware or malicious intent is effectively zero.",
