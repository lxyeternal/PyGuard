{
  "purpose": "Definition of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for OpenQASM 3 programs, providing data structures for parsing, analyzing, and representing quantum assembly code.",
  "sources": "No direct data input or external data reading; the code defines data structures and class hierarchies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network, file, or system calls present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code consists solely of class and data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. The code strictly defines AST classes and enums without executable or malicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for representing OpenQASM 3 constructs using dataclasses, enums, and type annotations. No runtime code, input handling, or external data processing is present. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious logic. All components serve to model the syntax of quantum assembly language, with no embedded system commands, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard AST data model for OpenQASM 3 programs, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely structural and does not perform any actions or data processing that could be malicious.",
