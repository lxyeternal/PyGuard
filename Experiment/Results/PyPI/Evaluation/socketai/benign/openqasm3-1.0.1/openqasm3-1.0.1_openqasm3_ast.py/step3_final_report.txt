{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive set of Python data classes, enums, and type annotations representing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for OpenQASM 3 programs. It serves as a structural schema for parsing, analysis, or transformation of quantum assembly language code.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data at runtime; it solely declares data structures and enums. No external data sources or inputs are processed.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, file I/O, network operations, or system calls. The code is purely declarative and static, with no runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code contains only class and enum definitions without executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for an AST schema.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured set of data classes and enums modeling the AST for OpenQASM 3. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or network communication. The code is purely declarative, intended for use in parsers or compilers. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and justified given the nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured AST schema for OpenQASM 3 with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for use in parsing, analysis, or compilation contexts.",
