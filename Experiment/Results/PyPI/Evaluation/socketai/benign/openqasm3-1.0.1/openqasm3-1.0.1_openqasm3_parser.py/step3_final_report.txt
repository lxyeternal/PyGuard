{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for parsing OpenQASM 3 programs into an abstract syntax tree (AST), facilitating syntax analysis and AST construction for quantum assembly language.",
  "sources": "Input source code string, tokens from lexer, and parser nodes during syntax analysis.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or storage; data flows from input strings through tokenization and parsing into AST nodes within the process.",
  "flows": "Source input string -> lexer -> token stream -> parser -> AST nodes with span annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of standard error handling and exception raising for syntax errors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard parser implementation utilizing ANTLR-generated classes and a visitor pattern to convert tokens into an AST. It includes error handling via custom exception and error listener, span annotations for nodes, and context management for scoping. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external communication are present. The logic is straightforward, and the code structure aligns with typical parsing workflows. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to processing untrusted input, but no active malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, transparent parser for OpenQASM 3, with no malicious features or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
