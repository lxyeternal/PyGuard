  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code snippet.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward Python module that defines a list of supported versions for the openqasm3 specification.\n   - It contains no external data input, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no malicious constructs.\n   - The code is purely informational and serves as metadata documentation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, static, and free of security issues. This aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - No report suggests any logical flaws or security vulnerabilities that are overlooked.\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as a static data declaration with no malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence score is 1 in all reports, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malware present (`malware: 0`).\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, such as executing external code, handling secrets, or obfuscating logic.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's static and transparent nature.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is a simple, static documentation module with no security issues.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
