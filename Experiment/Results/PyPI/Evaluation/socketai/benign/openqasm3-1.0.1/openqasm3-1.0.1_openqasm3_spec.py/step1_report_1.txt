  "purpose": "Define metadata about supported specifications for the openqasm3 package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the list 'supported_versions'. No external data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies or unusual behaviors; it's straightforward documentation and data definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module documenting supported specification versions for openqasm3. It assigns a list of supported versions as static strings. No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling occurs. The presence of docstrings and comments is standard for documentation purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely for documentation purposes. No malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies are present.",
