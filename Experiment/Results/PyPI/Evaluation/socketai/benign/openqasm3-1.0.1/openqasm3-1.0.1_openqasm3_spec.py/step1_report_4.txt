  "purpose": "Define metadata and supported versions for the 'openqasm3.spec' module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of supported_versions list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of metadata documentation, module export definitions, and a list of supported version strings. There are no input/output operations, external data reads, or potentially dangerous code constructs. The code is straightforward, static, and typical for a Python module defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static configuration or metadata declaration without any malicious intent or security issues.",
