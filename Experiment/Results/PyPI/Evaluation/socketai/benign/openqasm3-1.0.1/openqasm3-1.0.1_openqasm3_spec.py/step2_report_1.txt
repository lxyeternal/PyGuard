  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a simple Python module defining a static list of supported versions with documentation comments. There are no dynamic behaviors, no external data sources, no input/output operations, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The code appears entirely benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports consistently identify the code as a static data definition for documentation purposes, with no security risks. There are no errors or flawed reasoning in their assessments.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. Given the absence of any suspicious activity, these scores are appropriate. The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely static documentation data with no external input, no dynamic execution, and no malicious indicators, there's no justification for higher risk scores. The assigned scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting the lack of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward and clear)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct, no security risk present)\n\n### Additional comments:\nThe code is purely a static metadata module with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall assessment is that this is a benign, documentation-only module.",
