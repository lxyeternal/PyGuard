  "purpose": "The code defines metadata about supported specifications for the openqasm3 package, including a list of supported versions.",
  "sources": "The list 'supported_versions' is a data source indicating supported specification versions.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; the code does not process untrusted input or produce output based on external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely initializes and exposes a static list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports documentation metadata, defines an __all__ list, and assigns a list of supported version strings to 'supported_versions'. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behavior. The code appears purely informational and safe. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module containing metadata about supported specification versions. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
