  "purpose": "Define and document supported specification versions for the openqasm3.spec module.",
  "sources": "No external data input; the code initializes a list variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output susceptible to injection or data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only static list assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module documenting supported versions. It contains no input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data processing. The list 'supported_versions' is static, and the module's purpose is purely informational. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and serves as documentation with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
