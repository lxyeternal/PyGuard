  "purpose": "Define a list of supported OpenQASM 3 specification versions for the package.",
  "sources": "Static list assignment 'supported_versions' and documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, output, or data flow occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data definition with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static Python module that declares a list of supported specification versions with accompanying documentation. It contains no external data sources, no dynamic behavior, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, static, and documentation-oriented. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, and confidence: 1 are appropriate given the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature eliminate any security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All assessments are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
