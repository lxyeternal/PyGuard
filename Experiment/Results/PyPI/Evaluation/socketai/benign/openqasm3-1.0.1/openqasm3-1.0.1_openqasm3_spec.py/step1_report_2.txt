  "purpose": "Define and document supported OpenQASM3 specification versions.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines a list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and mainly consists of documentation and a list definition.",
  "analysis": "The code includes documentation comments, an import statement for '__all__', and a list of supported version strings. There are no dynamic data handling, no external inputs, and no suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be a simple module defining supported versions for a package, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a metadata module for supported specifications. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security issues are present.",
