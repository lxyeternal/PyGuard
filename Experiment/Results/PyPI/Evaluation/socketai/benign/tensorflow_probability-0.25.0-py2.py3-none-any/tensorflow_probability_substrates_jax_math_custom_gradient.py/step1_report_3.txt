{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for specifying custom gradients in TensorFlow Probability with JAX backend, primarily for advanced gradient manipulation in machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Input data originates from the arguments `fx`, `gx`, and `x` in the `custom_gradient` function; these are tensors supplied during gradient customization.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage or malicious effects could occur if untrusted data is used to influence gradient calculations or if the code manipulates data in a way that leaks information, but this code primarily performs tensor operations and gradient handling.",
  "flows": "The flow begins with receiving `fx`, `gx`, and `x`, then possibly applying `stop_gradient` and constructing a custom gradient using `override_grad`, which is combined with the original `fx` to produce the tensor with the custom gradient.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual control flow, obfuscated constructs, or hidden backdoors are present. The code appears to perform a known pattern for gradient modification, with clear documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions, notably `custom_gradient`, which creates tensors with custom gradient behavior via `stop_gradient` manipulations. It checks shapes consistency, constructs override gradient calculations, and returns a tensor with the desired gradient properties. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious code paths are present. The code strictly implements a known mathematical technique for custom gradients, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a legitimate utility for custom gradient definition in TensorFlow Probability with JAX, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be well-documented and purpose-built for advanced gradient handling, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
