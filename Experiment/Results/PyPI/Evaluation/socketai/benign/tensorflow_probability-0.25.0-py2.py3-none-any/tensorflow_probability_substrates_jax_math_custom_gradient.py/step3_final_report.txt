{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for embedding custom gradients into tensors, enabling gradient manipulation via stop_gradient techniques.",
  "sources": "Input tensors fx, gx, x; internal modules for shape assertions and dtype utilities.",
  "sinks": "Local tensor operations; no external data transmission or file/network I/O.",
  "flows": "fx, gx, x are processed with shape assertions and stop_gradient, then combined to produce a tensor with embedded custom gradient behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow detected; code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard techniques for custom gradient implementation, including shape assertions, tensor conversions, and stop_gradient manipulations. It does not perform any network, file, or system operations. The logic is consistent with known methods for gradient override, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific implementation of custom gradient functions in TensorFlow Probability with JAX backend. It poses no security threat, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
