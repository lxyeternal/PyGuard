{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to embed custom gradients into TensorFlow tensors, primarily for use in automatic differentiation and gradient manipulation within TensorFlow Probability.",
  "sources": "Reads input tensors and data for function evaluations (`fx`, `gx`, `x`). No external data sources or user input detected.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies gradient flow using `stop_gradient`. No direct data leaks, network operations, or file modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Input tensors (`fx`, `gx`, `x`) are processed and used to compute custom gradient embeddings via `stop_gradient`. No external or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to implement a known mathematical trick for custom gradients. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious control flows, or obfuscated code. Functionality aligns with standard gradient manipulation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for custom gradient embedding, including `is_list_like`, `identity`, and `custom_gradient`. The core function `custom_gradient` uses `stop_gradient` to control the gradient flow and ensures correct shape matching. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The implementation follows documented mathematical methods for gradient manipulation, with comments explaining the logic. No suspicious or malicious anomalies found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of custom gradient functions for TensorFlow Probability, employing well-known techniques. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The code appears safe and purpose-specific.",
