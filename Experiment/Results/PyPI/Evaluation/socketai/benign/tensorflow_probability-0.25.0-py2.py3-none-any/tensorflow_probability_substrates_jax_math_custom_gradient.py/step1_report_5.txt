{
  "purpose": "Define custom gradient functions for TensorFlow Probability using JAX backend, allowing manual control over gradient computation.",
  "sources": "Input tensors `fx`, `gx`, `x` provided to `custom_gradient`; potential data read occurs during tensor conversions and operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential gradient manipulations and tensor operations, but no external data transmission or file system access is present.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are converted and manipulated; `stop_gradient` is applied to control gradients; the flow leads to output tensor with custom gradient behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns; code is well-structured with clear comments. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom gradient function using TensorFlow operations, relying on `stop_gradient` to manually control gradient flow. It handles list-like inputs, performs shape assertions to ensure correctness, and computes an override gradient accordingly. No external data access, network calls, or malicious behaviors are evident. The logic is consistent with defining custom gradients in TensorFlow, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for custom gradient handling in TensorFlow Probability with no malicious or maliciously intent. It is safe in the context of supply chain security. No suspicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
