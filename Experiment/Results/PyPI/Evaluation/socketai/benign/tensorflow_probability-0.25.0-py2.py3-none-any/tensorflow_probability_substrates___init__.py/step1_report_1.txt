{
  "purpose": "The code initializes lazy loading of certain substrate modules (jax and numpy) for TensorFlow Probability, to be used later in the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and defines internal variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only sets up lazy loading of modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code. The use of lazy loaders is standard for optimizing module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package that uses lazy loading to defer the import of certain modules (jax and numpy). It imports internal utility functions, defines lazy loader instances, and manages symbol exportation. No suspicious or malicious patterns, no data leakage, no external data processing. It appears to be a benign, standard package initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation.",
