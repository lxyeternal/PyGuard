{
  "purpose": "This code is setting up lazy loading of substrate modules (jax and numpy) for TensorFlow Probability, allowing dynamic import and management of dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements from tensorflow_probability.python.internal and lazy_loader.LazyLoader for jax and numpy modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; the code only performs module loading and symbol filtering.",
  "flows": "Imports -> LazyLoader instantiation -> symbol filtering with remove_undocumented.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code employs standard patterns for module import management and does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility modules from TensorFlow Probability to manage substrate dependencies. It uses lazy loading to defer import of jax and numpy substrates, which is common for performance optimization. The '_allowed_symbols' list defines which symbols are exported. The call to 'remove_undocumented' ensures only specified symbols are exposed. There are no signs of malicious activity such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded credentials are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for managing optional dependencies in a Python package. It uses legitimate techniques for lazy loading and symbol management without any malicious intent or security risks.",
