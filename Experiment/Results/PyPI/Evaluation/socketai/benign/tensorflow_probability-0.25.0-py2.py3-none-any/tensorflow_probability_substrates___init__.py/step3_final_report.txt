  "purpose": "Set up lazy loading for optional TensorFlow Probability substrates 'jax' and 'numpy' to optimize performance and manage dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow_probability.python.internal, specifically 'all_util' and 'lazy_loader'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external data handling; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "LazyLoader instances load 'jax' and 'numpy' modules when accessed; 'remove_undocumented' restricts symbol exports.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward and standard for dependency management.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard patterns for optional dependency setup using lazy loading. It imports internal utilities, defines lazy loader instances for 'jax' and 'numpy', and restricts exported symbols to a predefined list. No external data, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. All signals indicate benign intent, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script for managing optional dependencies in TensorFlow Probability. It employs common, safe patterns without any malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The code poses no threat and is appropriate for use.",
