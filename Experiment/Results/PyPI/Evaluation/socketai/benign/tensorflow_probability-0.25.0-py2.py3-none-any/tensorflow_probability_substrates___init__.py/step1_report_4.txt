  "purpose": "Define and load substrates for TensorFlow Probability, specifically JAX and NumPy, using lazy loading.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow_probability.python.internal and lazy_loader instances for 'jax' and 'numpy'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data exposure.",
  "flows": "Imports are set up, and lazy loaders are initialized to load 'jax' and 'numpy' when accessed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lazy_loader is common for optional dependencies, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal utilities from TensorFlow Probability, then sets up lazy loading for 'jax' and 'numpy' substrates. These are standard practices to optimize import times and manage optional dependencies. No input sources such as user input or network data are present. No data sinks or flows suggest malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical patterns used in library initialization. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization for TensorFlow Probability to support multiple computational backends via lazy loading. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
