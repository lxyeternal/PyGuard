{
  "purpose": "To set up lazy loading of JAX and NumPy substrate modules for TensorFlow Probability, enabling flexible substrate selection.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and uses lazy_loader.LazyLoader to load 'jax' and 'numpy' dynamically.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; no network, file, or environment variable access observed.",
  "flows": "LazyLoader imports modules when their symbols are accessed, but no malicious flow or data exfiltration paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lazy loading might obscure module loading behavior but is a common pattern for optional dependencies. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal utilities and sets up lazy loading for 'jax' and 'numpy' modules within TensorFlow Probability. It employs 'lazy_loader.LazyLoader' to defer loading these modules until needed, which is a standard pattern to optimize startup time and manage optional dependencies. The list '_allowed_symbols' restricts accessible symbols. There is no suspicious or malicious logic, no network or file access, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup for optional dependencies in TensorFlow Probability. It uses standard lazy loading patterns without any malicious intent or security risks.",
