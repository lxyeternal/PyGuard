  "purpose": "Provide tools for probabilistic reasoning in TensorFlow Probability",
  "sources": "Import statement from tensorflow_probability.python and version information",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; no network or file output",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow or untrusted data processing present",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('from tensorflow_probability.python import *') can obscure code origin and control, but is common in large packages; no other suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of license headers, comments, and import statements. The wildcard import from a well-known library is standard for large frameworks and does not inherently suggest malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or other malicious indicators are present. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for TensorFlow Probability with licensing and comments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, benign, and primarily involved in importing library components. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The use of wildcard import is typical in package setup files but could be considered risky in other contexts; however, within a well-maintained library, this is not inherently malicious.",
