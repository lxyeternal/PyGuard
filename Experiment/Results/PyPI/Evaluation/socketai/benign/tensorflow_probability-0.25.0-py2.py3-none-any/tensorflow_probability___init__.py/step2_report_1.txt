  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is standard licensing and import statements, with no untrusted data handling or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected. The wildcard import is common in library code, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the wildcard import and commented-out code.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity. The wildcard import is a known pattern in large package modules.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1 — acceptable, though the security risk could be marginally higher due to the wildcard import, but it's standard practice here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same import pattern, noting that wildcard import can obscure imported entities but is typical in package code.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior. The potential risk from wildcard import is acknowledged but not considered malicious.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with comments on the use of 'import *' and disabled code.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity. The comments suggest awareness of potential issues but no actual malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, standard library import setup, no untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1 — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) due to the use of 'import *', which can be risky in untrusted contexts but is common in library code. Given that this is an internal setup file for a well-known library, this is acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No report indicates any malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The only minor concern is the wildcard import, but in the context of library code, it's standard practice.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import, but acceptable in this context)\n\nThis review confirms that the code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent.",
