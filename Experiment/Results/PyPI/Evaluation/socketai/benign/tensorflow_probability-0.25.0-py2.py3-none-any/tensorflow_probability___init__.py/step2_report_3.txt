  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is straightforward, licensing info, comments, and imports.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None. The comments about commented-out code and wildcard import are benign.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature. Confidence is high (1). Security risk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No malicious or security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to Report 1, standard import code.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** The use of wildcard import is noted as a concern but is common in package code.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated are 0; confidence is 0.9, which is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment. No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Again, standard import code with commented-out lines.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** The only concern is the wildcard import, which is noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.1 due to the wildcard import, which is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate evaluation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to previous reports.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** Wildcard import is noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.1, consistent with the import style.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Consistent with prior assessments.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** Wildcard import noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk 0.1, acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** All are very low (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the consistent analysis, I would **align the scores as follows**:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the wildcard import, which is common in package code but can be considered a minor concern)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects that the code is standard library setup code with no malicious intent, minimal obfuscation, and a very low security risk primarily due to coding style rather than malicious activity.",
