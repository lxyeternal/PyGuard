{
  "purpose": "To provide tools for probabilistic reasoning in TensorFlow, specifically importing core modules and version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from tensorflow_probability.python import *' and 'from tensorflow_probability.python.version import __version__'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or sensitive data operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; import statements are static.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' from a package can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code. The commented-out lines suggest potential for additional imports or bindings, but are inactive.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of license headers, comments, and import statements. The 'import *' from a well-known, reputable package ('tensorflow_probability.python') is generally safe but can obscure what specific components are imported. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The comments indicate some code is disabled, but nothing appears suspicious or malicious. Overall, the code appears to serve as an initialization or configuration script for a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions mainly to set up module imports and versioning for TensorFlow Probability. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'import *' is a potential obfuscation concern but is common in library initialization scripts and not inherently malicious.",
