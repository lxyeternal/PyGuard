{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for probabilistic reasoning in TensorFlow Probability, primarily importing modules and defining versioning.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tensorflow_probability.python' and 'tensorflow_probability.python.version' for module functionality and version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data leakage or external communication points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly static imports and module definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (from tensorflow_probability.python import *) which can obscure actual imported entities, but this is common in large package distributions and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license headers, import statements, and commented-out code. It does not include user input handling, network activity, or system modifications. The wildcard import may be considered risky in some contexts but is standard in package code. No evidence of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization file for TensorFlow Probability, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The use of wildcard import is typical for package modules and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
