  "purpose": "Initialization and import setup for TensorFlow Probability library, including licensing and version info.",
  "sources": "License comments, import statements, and commented-out code sections.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and comments do not process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`from tensorflow_probability.python import *`) which can obscure namespace but is common in package code; commented-out code indicates potential features disabled but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python library, primarily consisting of licensing info, comments, and import statements. The wildcard import is typical in package initialization files but generally discouraged elsewhere; it does not introduce malicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The commented-out code suggests some features are disabled but not malicious. The overall structure and content are benign and consistent with library code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The use of wildcard import is a common pattern in package initialization but can be flagged as a minor concern; however, it does not pose a security risk. The overall security risk score should be very low.",
