{
  "purpose": "This code provides tools for probabilistic reasoning within TensorFlow Probability library, mainly for importing modules and version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow_probability.python and version number from tensorflow_probability.python.version",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows involving untrusted input are present",
  "anomalies": "Commented out import lines and potentially unnecessary wildcard import, but these are benign and common in library code",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of licensing information, comments, and import statements. It uses a wildcard import from tensorflow_probability.python, which is typical in large package modules. No user input, untrusted data, or external code execution appears to be involved. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present. Commented-out code suggests some functionality is intentionally disabled, but not malicious. Overall, the code is standard library setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module initialization for TensorFlow Probability with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely imports necessary modules and contains licensing and comment annotations.",
