{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import and set up tools for probabilistic reasoning in TensorFlow Probability.",
  "sources": "Imports the entire tensorflow_probability.python module and the __version__ attribute from its version submodule.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports modules and variables.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a wildcard import (`from tensorflow_probability.python import *`) is generally discouraged but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of license comments, import statements, and commented-out lines for potential Google-specific bindings. The wildcard import could be considered a code practice concern but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import setup for TensorFlow Probability with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any sensitive operations, data leaks, or system modifications.",
