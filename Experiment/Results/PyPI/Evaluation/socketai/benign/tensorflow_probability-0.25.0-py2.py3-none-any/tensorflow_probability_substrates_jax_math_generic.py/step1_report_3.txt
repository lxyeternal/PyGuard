  "purpose": "Provide a set of mathematical functions and utilities primarily for numerical stability and tensor operations within TensorFlow Probability, including log-sum-exp, soft thresholding, and relaxed sorting.",
  "sources": "TensorFlow Probability internal modules, TensorFlow core functions, and NumPy for numerical operations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions; standard mathematical operations on tensors are performed without external data exfiltration or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from tensor inputs through mathematical transformations and reductions, with no external data sources or untrusted inputs explicitly integrated into the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Use of deprecation warnings and advanced tensor operations is consistent with typical numerical library implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements various numerically stable mathematical functions, including log-sum-exp variants, soft thresholding, and relaxed sorting matrices. All functions use standard TensorFlow and NumPy operations, with no indications of external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. Use of deprecation warnings and custom gradients appears consistent with library maintenance rather than malicious intent. The functions focus on numerical stability, tensor broadcasting, and mathematical transformations, without any anomalous or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of mathematical utility functions for tensor operations and does not contain any malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a standard component of a numerical library intended for stable computations within TensorFlow Probability. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are detected.",
