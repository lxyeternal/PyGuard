  "purpose": "This module provides a collection of mathematical functions primarily used for probabilistic and statistical calculations within TensorFlow Probability, including log-space computations, numerical stability utilities, and relaxation methods for sorting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as tensors `x`, `y`, `n`, `counts`, `w`, `logx`, `threshold`, and others, as well as from tensor operations like `tf.convert_to_tensor`, `tf.math`, and `tf.linalg`. It also accesses environment-related information via TensorFlow's internal APIs.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can potentially flow through the functions into tensor operations like `tf.math.log`, `tf.math.exp`, `tf.linalg.matrix_transpose`, `tf.reduce_sum`, and other mathematical operations. No explicit data leaks or external communications are present. No unsafe code execution or environment variable access is detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs (tensors and parameters) into tensor transformations, such as log, exp, softmax, and matrix operations. The calculations are self-contained and do not interface with external systems or perform network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. The code primarily implements mathematically stable algorithms, with some deprecated functions noted but not suspicious. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names are evident. Usage of deprecated TensorFlow APIs is present but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple mathematical utility functions used in probabilistic modeling, focusing on numerical stability (e.g., log-sum-exp variants, softplus inverse), sorting relaxation, and gradient handling. It relies entirely on TensorFlow operations and internal APIs, with no signs of malicious behavior. No external communication, file access, or environment manipulation occurs. The deprecated status of some functions suggests ongoing maintenance but does not indicate malicious intent. The code structure and function implementations are standard for scientific computing in TensorFlow.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a collection of mathematical utility functions for TensorFlow Probability, designed for numerical stability and probabilistic computations. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are identified. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured library component with no external malicious signals.",
