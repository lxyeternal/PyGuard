  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-maintained set of numerical utility functions used in probabilistic and tensor computations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified by the code's nature and maintenance artifacts. Overall, the supply chain integrity is sound, and the code can be considered safe."
