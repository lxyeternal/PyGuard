  "purpose": "Utility function to compute the diagonal of a Jacobian matrix of a function `ys=fn(xs)` with respect to `xs`.",
  "sources": "Reads input tensors `xs`, `ys`, and optionally a function `fn`. Uses TensorFlow operations such as `tf.gradients`, `tf.while_loop`, and tensor reshaping.",
  "sinks": "Uses gradients and tensor operations that could, in theory, be exploited if misused, but no untrusted external data sources or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs (`xs`, `ys`, `fn`) → Tensor conversions and broadcastings → Gradient computations within loops → Results stored in tensor arrays → Final Jacobian diagonal tensors returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code contains detailed comments and is a standard utility for Jacobian computations. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Jacobian diagonal computation using TensorFlow's gradient and control flow operations. It handles both eager and graph modes, with clear structure and no suspicious patterns. The code is complex due to gradient computations but follows typical patterns for such mathematical operations. No signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or data leakage. It is a legitimate utility for scientific computation. The presence of auto-generated comments and standard TensorFlow usage further support benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Jacobian diagonal computation for use in machine learning or mathematical applications. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. It functions as intended within the scope of mathematical gradient calculations.",
