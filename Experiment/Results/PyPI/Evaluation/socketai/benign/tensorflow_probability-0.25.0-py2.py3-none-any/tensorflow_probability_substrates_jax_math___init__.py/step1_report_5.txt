{
  "purpose": "The code provides an import and symbol management setup for TensorFlow Probability's JAX math functions, including various mathematical operations, special functions, linear algebra routines, and root-finding methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules such as tensorflow_probability and tensorflow_probability.python.internal, as well as internal symbol listing.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or data leak points are evident; the code primarily handles imports and symbol registration.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not process external inputs or execute untrusted code paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements, symbol registration, and comments. The removal of undocumented symbols and auto-generation comments are typical and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various modules and functions from the tensorflow_probability library and its JAX substrate. It defines an allowed symbols list and removes undocumented symbols to control API exposure. The code is auto-generated, with no execution logic, data processing, or untrusted input handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for TensorFlow Probability's JAX math functions, involving symbol management and imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be boilerplate or generated code meant for library structure, not for malicious purposes.",
