{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import and export module for TensorFlow Probability's JAX math functions, organizing various mathematical and special functions for use within the library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from imported modules within tensorflow_probability and from the static list of allowed symbols.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network operations, file writing, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into the list of allowed symbols, which is then used for documentation and module exports. No untrusted data inputs or external interactions are visible.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and auto-generated, with a comment indicating it is created by a rewrite script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numerous functions and modules from tensorflow_probability's JAX substrate, then filters and registers allowed symbols for export. It includes a commented out import ('dense_to_sparse') which may indicate optional or future features. The code contains no user input handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing. The comment indicates auto-generation, reducing suspicion of malicious intent. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, auto-generated library setup for mathematical functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes and exposes functions for external use. The overall security risk is negligible.",
