{
  "purpose": "This module aggregates and imports various mathematical functions and utilities from the TensorFlow Probability library, specifically for JAX substrate, to provide mathematical operations used in probabilistic programming and scientific computing.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal TensorFlow Probability packages such as all_util, ode, psd_kernels, bessel functions, custom_gradient, diag_jacobian, generic functions, gradient, gram_schmidt, integration, interpolation, linear algebra, minimize, numeric, root_search, scan_associative, special functions, and backend deprecation. No external input or data reading is evident.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling is present. The code only imports functions and declares a list of allowed symbols.",
  "flows": "The module does not process data flow; it only organizes imports and defines a list of exported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import and symbol export setup with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The comment indicates the file is auto-generated, which is normal for build systems.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from trusted TensorFlow Probability modules and a list of allowed symbols. The comments specify the code is auto-generated by a script (rewrite.py), indicating normal build process behavior. No signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious operations are present. There are no code execution, external network operations, or handling of untrusted input data. The structure and purpose align with a typical library initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, auto-generated import aggregator for TensorFlow Probability functions intended for JAX. There is no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
