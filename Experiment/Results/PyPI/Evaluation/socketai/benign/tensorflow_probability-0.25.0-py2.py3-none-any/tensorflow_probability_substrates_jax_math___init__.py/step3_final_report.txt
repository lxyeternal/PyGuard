{
  "purpose": "This code is an auto-generated module that imports various functions from TensorFlow Probability's JAX substrate, serving as an internal utility for mathematical operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data only from internal module imports; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static import statements to symbol registration, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is auto-generated, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The module is a benign, auto-generated collection of import statements for TensorFlow Probability functions tailored for JAX. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or code execution beyond static imports. The commented-out import is typical for optional features and does not indicate malicious intent. The structure and comments suggest it is a build artifact meant for internal use, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard library setup module with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate benign, auto-generated boilerplate code.",
