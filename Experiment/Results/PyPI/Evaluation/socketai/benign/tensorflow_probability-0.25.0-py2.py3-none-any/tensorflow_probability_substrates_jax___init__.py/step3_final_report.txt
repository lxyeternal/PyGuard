  "purpose": "Dependency validation and module import setup for TensorFlow Probability with JAX backend.",
  "sources": "The dynamic import of 'jax' within the '_ensure_jax_install()' function; static imports of various modules from 'tensorflow_probability.substrates.jax'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "The function attempts to import 'jax' and, upon failure, prints a message and raises an ImportError; subsequent static imports proceed normally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statement for error notification in dependency check; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard environment check for 'jax' and imports necessary modules for TensorFlow Probability's JAX substrate. The dynamic import is wrapped in a try-except block with user notification, which is common practice. No untrusted data, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The print statement in the exception handler is benign and for user guidance. Overall, the code is a typical setup routine with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency check and import setup script for TensorFlow Probability with JAX. It performs environment validation without any malicious behavior or security risks. The observed patterns are standard and safe.",
