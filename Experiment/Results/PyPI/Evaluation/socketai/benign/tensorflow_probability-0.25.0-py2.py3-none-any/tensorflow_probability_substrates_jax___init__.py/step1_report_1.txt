  "purpose": "Setup and import dependencies for TensorFlow Probability with JAX backend.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially the dynamic import of JAX via _ensure_jax_install().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no output or external data handling in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the only flow involves conditional import of JAX.",
  "anomalies": "The _ensure_jax_install() function dynamically imports JAX and handles ImportError; no malicious behavior detected, but the dynamic import may be considered unusual for some security reviews.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to ensure JAX is installed by importing it within a try-except block, printing a message if missing. All other imports are static and from known libraries. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is observed. The import of JAX is necessary for functionality and does not pose malicious intent. Comments and license headers are standard. The code structure is typical for a dependency setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dependency setup with a dynamic import check for JAX. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malware are detected. The only notable aspect is the dynamic import with a print message, which is benign but slightly unusual. Overall, the code appears safe.",
