  "purpose": "Ensure JAX is installed and import necessary modules from TensorFlow Probability's JAX substrate.",
  "sources": "Import statements, _ensure_jax_install() function, and the print statement within exception handling.",
  "sinks": "Print statement in exception handling, which outputs an error message if JAX is not installed.",
  "flows": "If JAX is missing, the exception handling flow triggers the print statement and raises ImportError.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and mainly performs import checks; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a function to verify JAX installation, printing an error message if not found. It then imports multiple modules from tensorflow_probability.substrates.jax, which are standard library imports. The commented-out lines are harmless. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The only potential concern is the print statement used for error reporting, but this is a common practice for user feedback. Overall, the code is standard and intended for setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a runtime check for JAX and imports necessary modules. No malware, backdoors, or malicious intent detected.",
