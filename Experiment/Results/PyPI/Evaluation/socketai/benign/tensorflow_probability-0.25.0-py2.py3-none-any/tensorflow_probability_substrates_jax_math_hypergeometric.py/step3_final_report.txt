  "purpose": "Implementation of hypergeometric functions (2F1) in TensorFlow, including series expansions, recurrence relations, and transformations for various parameter regimes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters a, b, c, z read as tensors; no external data or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Computed hypergeometric function output; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input tensors (a, b, c, z) flow through mathematical transformations, series expansions, and recurrence relations to produce the output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is purpose-specific and mathematically standard.",
  "analysis": "The code employs well-established numerical methods for special functions, including Taylor series, continued fractions, and recurrence relations, with safeguards for convergence and numerical stability. No signs of malicious activity, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The implementation is detailed, purpose-driven, and aligns with scientific computing standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific implementation of hypergeometric functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.05 are consistent with the analysis.",
