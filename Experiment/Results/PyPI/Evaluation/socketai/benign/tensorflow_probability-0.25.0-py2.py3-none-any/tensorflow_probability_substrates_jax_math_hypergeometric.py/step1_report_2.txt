  "purpose": "Implementation of hypergeometric functions in TensorFlow, providing various computational methods for hypergeometric functions with special handling for small, large, and near-singular parameters.",
  "sources": "Import of numpy, TensorFlow (via tf), dtype_util, prefer_static (ps), and tfp_math modules; reading input parameters a, b, c, z for functions; internal computations involving mathematical series, recurrence relations, and transformations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points are minimal; the code computes mathematical functions and does not directly handle external untrusted input. No insecure data handling or unsafe data outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters a, b, c, z flow into various functions for computation; data flows through series expansions, recurrence relations, and transformations; result is returned as the output hypergeometric value, with internal gradients and series computations serving as intermediate flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code involves advanced mathematical operations, but nothing appears intentionally malicious. No suspicious network activity, hidden code, or obfuscation patterns present. The code uses custom gradients, which is standard in TensorFlow custom operations.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous implementation of hypergeometric functions, with multiple strategies to handle different parameter regimes, including Taylor series, fractional computations, and recurrence relations. It includes safeguards for convergence and exceptional cases, using mathematical identities and transformations. No signs of malicious logic, data exfiltration, or harmful behavior are present. The structure and comments suggest it is an academic or scientific library component rather than malicious code. Overall, the code is complex but legitimate, focused on accurate mathematical computation without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a detailed implementation of hypergeometric functions intended for scientific computations, with no indication of malicious activity. It employs standard mathematical techniques, safeguards, and transformations. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears safe and legitimate for use within mathematical and scientific contexts.",
