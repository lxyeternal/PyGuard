  "purpose": "Implementation of hypergeometric functions in TensorFlow for mathematical computations.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy, tensorflow_probability, and internal utility modules; functions reading input parameters for hypergeometric calculations.",
  "sinks": "Computations involving input tensors for hypergeometric functions, including potential transformations and series calculations.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are processed through series expansions, recurrence relations, and transformations, leading to the computed hypergeometric function values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Extensive use of mathematical identities and series expansions appears legitimate. No obfuscated code, no network connections, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly implements hypergeometric functions with multiple methods for different parameter regimes, including Taylor series, continued fractions, and recurrence relations. It masks exceptional parameters to improve convergence, uses custom gradients for differentiability, and handles various identities for stability. The implementation relies on standard mathematical identities and numerical methods typical for hypergeometric function computation. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, data leakage, or unauthorized system access are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, mathematically-focused implementation of hypergeometric functions without malicious intent. It uses standard numerical techniques and safeguards to ensure accurate calculations. No evidence suggests malicious sabotage or malware within this code fragment.",
