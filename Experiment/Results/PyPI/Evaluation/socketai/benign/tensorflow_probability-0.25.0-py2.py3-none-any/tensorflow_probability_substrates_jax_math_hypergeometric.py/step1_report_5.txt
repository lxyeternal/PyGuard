{
  "purpose": "Implementation of hypergeometric functions in TensorFlow for mathematical computations.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, tensorflow_probability, and internal utility modules; function parameters such as 'a', 'b', 'c', 'z' from user or external input.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical functions and tensor operations that output hypergeometric calculations; no external data sinks or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('a', 'b', 'c', 'z') are processed through tensor conversions, mathematical transformations, and series calculations within various functions, returning computed hypergeometric values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. The code performs complex mathematical computations with convergence checks and identity transformations. No suspicious dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. No obfuscated code or misleading variable usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a mathematically focused implementation of hypergeometric functions using TensorFlow, including series expansions, recurrence relations, and special case handling. It relies on standard scientific computing practices, proper input validation, and careful handling of exceptional cases. No indicators of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or harmful operations are present. The only potential concern is the complexity and mathematical nature of the code, but it appears well-structured and purpose-driven.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate mathematical library for hypergeometric functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a standard implementation for scientific computations without any malicious signals.",
