  "purpose": "Implement hypergeometric functions (2F1) in TensorFlow with various numerical methods and transformations for different parameter ranges.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters a, b, c, z for hypergeometric function computations, including tensor conversions and broadcast shape calculations.",
  "sinks": "Uses mathematical operations to compute function values; no sinks for untrusted data affecting system or network behavior are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through various computational routines, series expansions, recurrence relations, and transformations without external data or untrusted input handling beyond mathematical calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No unusual or misleading code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden functionalities detected. All operations are mathematical and relevant to the hypergeometric function computation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements advanced mathematical functions for hypergeometric calculations, using series expansions, recurrence relations, and transformations for different parameter regimes. It employs TensorFlow's custom gradient feature for differentiation w.r.t. 'z'. No external data sources, network calls, or potential data leaks are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears clean, purpose-specific, and consistent with mathematical implementation standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a mathematically focused implementation of hypergeometric functions with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears as a legitimate, purpose-driven numerical library component. No security threats or malware behavior are detected.",
