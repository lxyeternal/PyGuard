  "purpose": "Implementing the modified Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization algorithm for vectors, mainly used in numerical linear algebra within machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Reads input tensor 'vectors' and optional 'num_vectors' parameter; uses TensorFlow Probability internal functions and static shape utilities.",
  "sinks": "Performs mathematical operations on input tensors; no sinks that involve untrusted data leading to external effects or leaks.",
  "flows": "Input 'vectors' are normalized and orthogonalized through in-place updates, with no external data or network communication involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious loops, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward numerical linear algebra implementation, with standard TensorFlow usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a numerical algorithm for orthogonalization, using standard TensorFlow operations for normalization, dot products, and loop constructs. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The function uses well-documented math routines with clear scope. No signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. The implementation appears legitimate and typical for scientific computation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization algorithm with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected mathematical operations without external communication or sensitive data handling.",
