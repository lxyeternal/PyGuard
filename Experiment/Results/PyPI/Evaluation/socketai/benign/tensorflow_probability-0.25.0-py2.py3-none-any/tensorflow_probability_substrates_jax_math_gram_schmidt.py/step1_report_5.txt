  "purpose": "Implementation of the modified Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization algorithm for vectors, primarily for numerical stability and orthogonalization in linear algebra computations.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'vectors' which is a tensor of shape [..., d, n], read during the function call; shape and dimension queries using ps.shape; internal tensor operations and dot products.",
  "sinks": "Normalized vectors returned, potential use in downstream linear algebra operations; no explicit sink of untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input 'vectors' -> normalization and orthogonalization steps -> output of orthonormalized vectors; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard linear algebra operations and TensorFlow functions. No obfuscation, unusual language features, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard modified Gram-Schmidt process using TensorFlow operations with clear, well-documented steps. It processes input vectors, orthogonalizes them, normalizes the result, and returns the orthonormalized vectors. The use of 'tf.einsum' and 'tf.linalg.norm' is consistent with linear algebra routines. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a standard mathematical implementation, auto-generated for reuse in the TensorFlow Probability project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a numerical linear algebra algorithm, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves a functional purpose within TensorFlow Probability for orthogonalization tasks. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.",
