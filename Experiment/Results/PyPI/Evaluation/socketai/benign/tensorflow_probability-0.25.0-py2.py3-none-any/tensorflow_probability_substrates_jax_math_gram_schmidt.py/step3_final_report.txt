  "purpose": "Implementation of the modified Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization algorithm for tensor vectors.",
  "sources": "Input tensor 'vectors' of shape [..., d, n], representing column vectors to be orthonormalized.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; computations are internal tensor operations with no network or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Vectors are normalized and orthogonalized via dot products and projections within the tensor flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard numerical linear algebra routine, utilizing well-known tensor operations for normalization and orthogonalization. It includes clear documentation, references, and no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The implementation is consistent with established algorithms, with no external data flows or network activity. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of the Gram-Schmidt process with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use in open-source projects, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
