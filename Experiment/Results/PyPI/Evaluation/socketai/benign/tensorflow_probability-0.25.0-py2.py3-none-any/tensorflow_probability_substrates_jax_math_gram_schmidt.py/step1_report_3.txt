  "purpose": "Implement the modified Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization algorithm for vectors.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'vectors' for the orthonormalization process.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input vectors are normalized and orthogonalized through dot products and subtraction, with no external or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard linear algebra operations and well-documented mathematical procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard numerical algorithm for orthonormalizing a set of vectors using the modified Gram-Schmidt process. It uses well-established TensorFlow functions for normalization, dot products, and iterative processing with tf.while_loop. No external data sources, no network or file I/O, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a mathematical algorithm with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, open-source mathematical implementation for orthonormalization with no indications of malicious intent. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Overall security risk is minimal, with high confidence in the benign nature of this code.",
