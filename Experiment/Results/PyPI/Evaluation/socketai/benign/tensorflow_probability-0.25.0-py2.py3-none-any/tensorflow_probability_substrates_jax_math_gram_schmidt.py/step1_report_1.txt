  "purpose": "Implementation of the modified Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization algorithm for vector sets.",
  "sources": "Input parameter `vectors`, which is a tensor of vectors; internal tensor operations reading tensor shapes and performing calculations.",
  "sinks": "Normalized vectors returned at the end; no data sinks indicating external data leaks or untrusted data effects.",
  "flows": "Input vectors are processed through normalization, projection, and subtraction to orthogonalize; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; code uses standard linear algebra operations, well-documented, and focused on mathematical computation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard modified Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process, with no signs of malicious behavior. It normalizes vectors, orthogonalizes them iteratively, and handles shape management carefully. There are no suspicious network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be a legitimate mathematical utility function, with extensive comments and references. No anomalies or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a mathematical algorithm for orthonormalization. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks, and appears safe. The presence of auto-generation comments does not imply malicious intent, only code generation history.",
