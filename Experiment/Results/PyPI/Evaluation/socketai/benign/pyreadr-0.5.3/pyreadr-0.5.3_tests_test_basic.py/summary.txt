  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite for pyreadr with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities detected. The use of network fetches is standard for testing purposes and does not compromise security when sources are trusted. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and typical security standards."
