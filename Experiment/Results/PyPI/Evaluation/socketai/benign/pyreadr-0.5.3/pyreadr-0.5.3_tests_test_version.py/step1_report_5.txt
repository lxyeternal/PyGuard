{
  "purpose": "The script checks whether the version of the pyreadr module matches the version specified in setup.py and documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of setup.py file; accesses pyreadr.__version__; reads conf.release.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads setup.py content -> extracts version string -> compares with module version and conf.release.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to extract version; relies on file content structure; no validation or sanitization of setup.py content.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs straightforward version comparison by reading static files and module attributes. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input. The regex used is simple and targets a specific pattern. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. It simply reads files and compares strings, which is typical for version validation routines.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a benign task of verifying version consistency between module, setup configuration, and documentation. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
