{
  "purpose": "This code imports functions and error classes from local modules related to reading and writing R data files, as well as error handling, and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.pyreadr' and '.custom_errors' modules, and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, network communication, or untrusted data handling is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only imports and assigns a version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a version string assignment. No external input, data processing, or sensitive operations are present. The imported functions are likely standard for the package's functionality related to R data manipulation, and the error classes support exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation, and the code is straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py or main module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package setup code with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply imports necessary functions and defines a version string, which is typical in Python packages.",
