  "purpose": "Import functions and error classes from local modules for reading, writing, and downloading R data and handling custom errors.",
  "sources": "No direct input or data reading in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; no untrusted data handling or leakage present.",
  "flows": "No flow of data from sources to sinks; code only defines imports and a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This code imports functions and classes from local modules, sets a version string, and does not perform any data processing, network operations, or execute dynamic code. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The structure is typical for module initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module import and version declaration with no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation.",
