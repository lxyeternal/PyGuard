  "purpose": "Module initialization importing functions and error classes, setting version",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.pyreadr and .custom_errors)",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Importing functions and error classes; no runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a version string assignment. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The import of 'download_file' does not imply malicious intent, as it is not invoked here. The code is typical for a package's __init__.py or setup module, with no security risks or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The import statements and version setting are standard, and the code does not perform any harmful actions.",
