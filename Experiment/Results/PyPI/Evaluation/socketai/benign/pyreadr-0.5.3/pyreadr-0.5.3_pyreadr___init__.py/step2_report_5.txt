  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the reported issues, their reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module initialization segment, primarily consisting of import statements and a version string.\n- No data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with malware scores at 0 and security risks at or near 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- The code matches the original snippet: it only imports functions and error classes from local modules and sets a version string.\n- No issues are present in the code itself, and the reports' conclusions are consistent with the code.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and typical for a package's initialization.\n- The confidence levels are high, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Near zero, consistent with the lack of external effects or data flow.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- Since the code is purely import statements and a version string, there are no grounds to assign any higher risk scores.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n- The reasoning aligns with best practices in static code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:** Given the analysis, I agree with the current scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.1 (or 0), but given the reports, 0 is more appropriate.\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
