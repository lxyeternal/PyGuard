{
  "purpose": "This code imports functions from internal modules related to reading and writing R data files, as well as custom error classes, and sets a version string. Its purpose appears to be providing an interface for R data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.pyreadr' and '.custom_errors' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and defines a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded credentials identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports functions and classes from local modules and defines a version string. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input handling, and no potential for malicious data flow. The structure and content are consistent with normal module setup. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign module import and setup snippet with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger, legitimate project related to R data processing.",
