{
  "purpose": "This setup script is intended to compile and install the 'pyreadr' Python package, which provides functionality for reading and writing R data files into pandas data frames.",
  "sources": "Reads platform information, Cython version, glob patterns for source files, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leaks or untrusted data handling in this script.",
  "flows": "The code gathers source files, sets compilation options, and configures build parameters without executing untrusted code or external commands beyond standard package setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The only potential concern is the use of external source files and compilation settings, but these are typical in extension building.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies Cython version, collects C source files, and configures build options based on the OS. It raises errors for unsupported platforms or incompatible Python architectures. The setup parameters are standard for building a Cython extension. No network activity, system modifications, or hidden behavior observed. The author contact email is a placeholder. The script does not include code injection, dynamic code execution, or malicious logic. It solely manages build configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate package setup script for building a Cython-based extension. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and purpose-driven.",
