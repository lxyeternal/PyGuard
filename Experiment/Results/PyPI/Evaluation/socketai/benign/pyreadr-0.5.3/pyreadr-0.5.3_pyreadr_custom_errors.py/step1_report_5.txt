  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python package related to reading data files.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, output, or security-sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines exception classes without any operational flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes by inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The simplicity indicates a standard approach to error handling without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign and typical pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
