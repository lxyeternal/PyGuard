  "purpose": "Define two custom exception classes for error handling in Python.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are simple declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two straightforward class definitions inheriting from Exception, serving as custom error types. There are no data inputs, outputs, external dependencies, or malicious patterns. The code is minimal, clear, and standard for error handling. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The security and malware scores are correctly set to 0, and confidence is high due to the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
