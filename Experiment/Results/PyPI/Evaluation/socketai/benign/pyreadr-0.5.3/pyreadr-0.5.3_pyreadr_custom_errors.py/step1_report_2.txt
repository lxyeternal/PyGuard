  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to pyreadr and librdata operations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows, as there are no operational code or data handling mechanisms.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception class declarations inheriting from Python's Exception base class. There are no data inputs, outputs, or operational code. The classes are simple and standard, serving as specific error types for a module. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. The code appears straightforward and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious elements.",
