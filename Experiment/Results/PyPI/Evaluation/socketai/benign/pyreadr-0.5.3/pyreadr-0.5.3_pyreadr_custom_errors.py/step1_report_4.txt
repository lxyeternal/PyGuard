{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in Python programs related to 'pyreadr' and 'librdata' modules.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as no input processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains only class declarations for exceptions. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, intended for specific error handling. There are no data input sources, no processing logic, and no dangerous functions. The code appears to be a simple, standard implementation of custom exceptions without any signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as error class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical pattern for handling specific errors in a Python package.",
