  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of two simple class definitions inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data flows, or external dependencies.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (fully confident in their benign assessment)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes with no malicious behavior, scores above 0 are unwarranted.\n   - The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n   - The risk score remains at 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign is justified.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, benign definition of custom exception classes with no malicious or security-related issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as harmless.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\nIf I were to assign my own scores based on this review, I would agree with the current scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms that the code poses no security threat.",
