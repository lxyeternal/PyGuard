  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code in all reports is simply two class definitions inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no data flows, no input/output operations, no external dependencies, and no suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as custom exception classes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports consistently state that the code is benign and free of malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - No inaccuracies or logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5.\n   - This is appropriate because the code contains no malicious or security-threatening behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n   - They focus on the code's straightforward purpose.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - The uniformity across reports reflects the same conclusion: the code is harmless.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Evaluation:** The code is a standard, minimal implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security-related issues.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Reasoned Conclusion:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the absence of any security concerns or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is purely definitional, with no operational or malicious elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
