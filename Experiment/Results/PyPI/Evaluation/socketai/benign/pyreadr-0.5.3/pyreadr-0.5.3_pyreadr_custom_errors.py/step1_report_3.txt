  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to pyreadr and librdata operations.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; no source-to-sink paths exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no unusual code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. No input/output, no data processing, no suspicious behavior, and no third-party library usage or obfuscated code. It appears to be standard Python code for error handling. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious instructions, or suspicious structures present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign set of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a typical pattern used for error handling in Python projects.",
