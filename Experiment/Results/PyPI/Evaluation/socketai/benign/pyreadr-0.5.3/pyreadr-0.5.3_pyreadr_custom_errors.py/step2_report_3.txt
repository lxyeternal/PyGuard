  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only contains two simple class definitions inheriting from Exception.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is straightforward and serves a common purpose in error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not overstate or understate the benign nature of the code.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data sources, sinks, or flows.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, no justification needed.\n   - The code is non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and carries no security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware`: 0.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they are cautious and accurate.\n   - They correctly interpret the code's purpose and security posture.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n- **Estimated Malware Score:** 0\n- **Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Estimated Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the issues as benign.\n\n**Overall Recommendation:**\n\nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect its benign nature.",
