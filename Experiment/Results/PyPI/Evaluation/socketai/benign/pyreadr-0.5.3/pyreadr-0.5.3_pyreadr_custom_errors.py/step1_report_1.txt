  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to pyreadr and librdata.",
  "sources": "No input data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions, inheriting from the Exception base class, with no other logic or data handling. No external input, data processing, or output occurs. No indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The simplicity and purpose align with standard Python exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and serves to define custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
