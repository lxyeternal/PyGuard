  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from `Exception`. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external dependencies.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, minimal, and serves a common purpose: defining custom exception classes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for error handling.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n   - The analysis and conclusions are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis, as there are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate. Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious or security-compromising elements, a higher risk score isn't justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is implied or present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes, common in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the current scores.**",
