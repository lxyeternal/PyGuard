  "flows": "Reading file content for description during package setup; no data flows involving user input or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script with no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies. It reads the README.md file to include a long description, which is standard practice. The script does not perform any network operations, execute dynamic code, or handle untrusted input. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
