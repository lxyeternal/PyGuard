  "purpose": "To set up and configure the packaging for the Python project 'streamlit_vertical_slider'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the filesystem using Path and __file__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs setup and file reading operations.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file and passing static configuration data to setuptools.setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, reads a local README.md file for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static configuration parameters such as package name, version, author details, description, URL, and dependencies. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No input from untrusted sources is processed at runtime, and there are no suspicious network calls, code injections, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
