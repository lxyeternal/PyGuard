  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; static data in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Reads local README.md file -> passes static metadata to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script that reads a local README file and calls setuptools.setup() with static package information. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or user input handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature make it unlikely to harbor malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
