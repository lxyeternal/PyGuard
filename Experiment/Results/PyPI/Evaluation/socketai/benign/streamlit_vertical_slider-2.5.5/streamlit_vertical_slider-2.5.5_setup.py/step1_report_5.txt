{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package called 'streamlit_vertical_slider'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; package metadata from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output or network calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README.md file into the 'long_description' variable, then into setuptools.setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. No network activity, no environment variable misuse.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup and reads a local README file for description. It configures package metadata such as name, version, author, description, URL, dependencies, and package inclusion. All operations are standard for Python package setup files. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, data leaks, or external communications are evident. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies without any malicious or malicious-looking actions.",
