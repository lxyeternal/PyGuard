{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'streamlit_vertical_slider' to facilitate its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; package dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data output or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md content flows into the setup configuration; dependencies are declared but not dynamically fetched or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures using setuptools. It reads a local README file to include as long description and defines package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for package setup, with no indication of malicious intent. No user input, external data sources, or code execution beyond static file reading and package configuration are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
