  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the component and its configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows or untrusted sinks identified.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; use of local paths in development is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as a straightforward UI component with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — reasonable, given no evident issues.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes the component's purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious external calls.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses local paths and environment flags, typical in deployment.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; notes the import of 'idna' which is unused.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Unused import ('idna') is benign but worth noting.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; code is standard for a UI component.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. The only minor note is the unused import, which doesn't impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes the component and its setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of local paths and environment flags are typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; code is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes the component.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of local paths and environment flags are typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; code is purely UI configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — very low, given the code's benign UI configuration purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and reasonable. The code is a standard, safe implementation of a Streamlit custom component with no malicious or security-threatening features. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
