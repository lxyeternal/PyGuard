  "purpose": "Defines a customizable vertical slider component for Streamlit with various styling options and environment-based path configuration.",
  "sources": "User input parameters for slider configuration, environment flags, and local file paths for frontend assets.",
  "sinks": "Returns slider value; no external data flows or network calls detected.",
  "flows": "User interacts with slider -> value is returned; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import 'idna.valid_contextj'; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard UI component with conditional path loading for development and production. It uses straightforward parameter handling and no external data or network activity. The import of 'idna' is unused but harmless. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Streamlit custom slider component with no signs of malware or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
