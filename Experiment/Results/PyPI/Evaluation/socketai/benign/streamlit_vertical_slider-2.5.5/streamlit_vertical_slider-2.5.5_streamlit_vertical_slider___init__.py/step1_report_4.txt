{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Streamlit component for a customizable vertical slider widget, including configuration for appearance and behavior, and demonstrates its usage in a sample Streamlit app.",
  "sources": "User input through Streamlit widget parameters, environment variables (via os module), and local file paths for component deployment.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no direct data leakage or untrusted data handling beyond standard widget input.",
  "flows": "Widget parameters flow from user interaction into the '_component_func' call; no external data flows or untrusted sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'os.path' and local component URL in non-release mode, but these are standard for development; no suspicious code or hidden backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party modules necessary for UI components. It defines a 'vertical_slider' function with configurable options, including color, shape, and size, but no code injections or malicious behaviors. The '_RELEASE' flag toggles between local development and production modes, using local file paths, which is typical. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network communications initiated by the script. The additional Streamlit app setup in non-release mode is for testing purposes and does not contain malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard implementation of a customizable UI component for Streamlit, with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is designed for legitimate UI customization and testing, with no evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malware.",
