  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a UI component for Streamlit, with configurable styles.\n- No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious code are identified.\n- The import of 'idna' (specifically 'valid_contextj') is unused in the code, which is benign but indicates possible leftover code.\n- The code uses conditional paths for development vs production (_RELEASE flag), which is standard.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, external data processing, or system modifications.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All assign 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low (0.1–0.2), consistent with benign UI code.\n- **Potential issues:** The only minor concern is the unused import 'idna.valid_contextj', which doesn't impact security.\n\n**Are the issues present in the code?**\n- The reports do not identify any actual issues or vulnerabilities in the code. They focus on confirming benign behavior.\n\n**Any errors or flaws in the reports?**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2) are reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe UI component for Streamlit.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only minor note is the unused 'idna' import, which is not harmful but could be cleaned up.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to unused import and environment path handling, which are standard practices)\n\n**Final verdict:** The code is safe, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative in their scoring.",
