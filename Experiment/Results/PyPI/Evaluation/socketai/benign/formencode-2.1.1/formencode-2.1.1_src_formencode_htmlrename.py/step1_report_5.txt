{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse and modify HTML form elements by renaming form fields, either by applying a custom renaming function or by adding a prefix to field names.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (form strings), and within the handle_field method, it reads attribute values such as 'name' from attrs.",
  "sinks": "The code writes modified form data back via self.write_tag, which outputs the altered HTML form elements. It also manipulates attribute data in attrs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input form string through the parser, where field names are extracted (source), potentially renamed or prefixed, and then outputted via write_tag (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard parsing and string manipulation techniques. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No network activity or system commands are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a parser subclass to process HTML form elements, renaming 'name' attributes based on a provided function or prefix. The parser's methods handle start tags, end tags, and attributes in a typical manner, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious side effects or data leaks. It operates solely on provided input data and outputs modified form data, which appears intended for legitimate form processing. No malicious code, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network activity, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard form field renaming utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected parsing and string manipulation tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
