  "purpose": "A utility module to rename or add prefixes to form field names within HTML forms, by parsing and rewriting form HTML strings.",
  "sources": "Input form HTML string provided to the rename and add_prefix functions.",
  "sinks": "The rewritten form HTML string generated by the RenamingParser, which outputs modified HTML content.",
  "flows": "Input form HTML string -> RenamingParser.feed() -> handle_field() modifies 'name' attributes via rename_func -> close() finalizes and generates output -> returned form string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. The code solely performs HTML form field renaming and attribute modification without external data or secret handling.",
  "analysis": "The module imports a specific parser and defines functions to rename form fields or add prefixes, using a callback rename_func. The RenamingParser subclass overrides methods to modify 'name' attributes during HTML parsing. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no handling of sensitive data. The primary operation is HTML attribute rewriting, which appears benign. The code follows standard parsing and rewriting practices and does not contain obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple, benign form field renaming and prefix addition without malicious intent or security risks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident.",
