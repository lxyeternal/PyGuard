  "purpose": "A utility module for renaming form fields within HTML form markup, either by applying a custom renaming function or adding a prefix to each field name.",
  "sources": "Input HTML form string fed into the 'rename' or 'add_prefix' functions.",
  "sinks": "The 'feed' method of RenamingParser processes the form data; attribute modification occurs within handle_field, which alters 'name' attributes in HTML tags.",
  "flows": "Input form string -> RenamingParser.feed() -> handle_field modifies 'name' attributes based on renaming function -> close() finalizes the modified HTML form.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies heavily on a third-party class 'RewritingParser', but no explicit malicious or suspicious code (e.g., network activity, obfuscated code, credential handling) is present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to rename form fields and add prefixes. It extends a parser class to handle HTML tags, specifically 'input', 'textarea', and 'select', modifying their 'name' attributes. The renaming logic is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. The code's purpose is to manipulate HTML forms safely, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. It relies on the 'RewritingParser' class, which is assumed to be a standard HTML parser. No network activity, credential handling, or system modifications are present. The code appears benign and solely focused on form attribute modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for renaming form fields in HTML forms, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or system modification. Its security risk is minimal, primarily centered around correct usage of the third-party parser and proper input sanitization, which are outside the scope of this review.",
