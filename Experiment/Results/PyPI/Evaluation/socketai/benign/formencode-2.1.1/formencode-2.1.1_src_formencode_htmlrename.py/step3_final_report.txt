  "purpose": "Utility module for renaming or prefixing HTML form field names within form markup strings.",
  "sources": "Reads 'name' attributes from HTML form tags during parsing via handle_field method.",
  "sinks": "Modifies 'name' attribute values; no external sinks or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Source: get_attr(attrs, 'name', '') -> rename_func(name) -> set_attr(attrs, 'name', new_name) -> write_tag()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a subclass of RewritingParser to parse HTML form elements and modify their 'name' attributes. It provides functions to rename all fields or add prefixes, with straightforward logic. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The parser handles standard HTML tags and modifies attributes as instructed. The implementation is simple, clear, and adheres to benign utility functions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential for misuse if embedded maliciously, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for HTML form attribute rewriting with no malicious intent or behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the code poses minimal security risk. No modifications to the reports or scores are necessary.",
