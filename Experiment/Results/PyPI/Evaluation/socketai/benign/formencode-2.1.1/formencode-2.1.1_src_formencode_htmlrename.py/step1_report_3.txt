{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions to rename or add prefixes to form fields within HTML form data, primarily for form manipulation or processing.",
  "sources": "Reads form data through the 'feed' method of the RenamingParser class, which processes HTML form tags and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Modifies attribute values of form elements (like 'name') via set_attr; potential modification points for input data.",
  "flows": "Input form data is fed into RenamingParser; renaming functions process 'name' attributes; modified form data is reconstructed as text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution detected. The code performs straightforward form attribute manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a form renaming utility, utilizing the RewritingParser base class to parse and modify HTML form elements. It includes functions for renaming all fields with a custom function and adding prefixes. The class methods override parsing events to replace 'name' attributes safely. No external data sources, network calls, or system manipulations are present. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. The code appears to be a standard utility for form processing, with clear structure and no anomalies indicating malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious form processing utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply modifies form field names for legitimate purposes.",
