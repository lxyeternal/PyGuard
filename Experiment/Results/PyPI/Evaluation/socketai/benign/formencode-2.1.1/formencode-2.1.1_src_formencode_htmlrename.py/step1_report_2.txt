{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to rename form fields within HTML form data, either by applying a custom rename function or adding a prefix to each field name.",
  "sources": "The code reads form data as a string input when calling the rename() or add_prefix() functions.",
  "sinks": "The code writes modified form data using methods like self.write_tag() and self.set_attr() within the RenamingParser class.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input form string → parser processes tags and attributes → renaming functions modify 'name' attributes → modified form data is output as a string.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on external library formencode.rewritingparser.RewritingParser; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is observed. No network activity, file operations, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of form field renaming within HTML form data. It defines functions to rename all fields or add prefixes, utilizing a subclass of RewritingParser to parse and rewrite HTML tags. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors, are present. The code performs sanitization by manipulating form attributes within the parser and outputs modified HTML. No suspicious or anomalous code constructs are detected. It appears to be a benign utility for form field manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility designed for renaming HTML form fields. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident. It does not pose any threat based on this review.",
