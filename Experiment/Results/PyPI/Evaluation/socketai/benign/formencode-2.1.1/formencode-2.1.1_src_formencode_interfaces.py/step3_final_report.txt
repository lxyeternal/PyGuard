{
  "purpose": "The code defines interface classes and attributes for a form validation framework, serving as documentation or scaffolding rather than executable logic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, attribute initializations, method signatures (notably missing 'self' in __init__ and __call__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is structural with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Method signatures (__init__, __call__) lack 'self' parameters, indicating incomplete or placeholder code; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of interface and attribute definitions with descriptive docstrings. The missing 'self' in method signatures is a syntactic error, not malicious. There are no external data interactions, secrets, or obfuscation. The code's purpose appears to be documentation or framework scaffolding. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware scores at 0 and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight elevation in risk scores (0.1) in some reports is justified by the syntactic issues, which are bugs, not security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor syntax errors are implementation issues, not security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
