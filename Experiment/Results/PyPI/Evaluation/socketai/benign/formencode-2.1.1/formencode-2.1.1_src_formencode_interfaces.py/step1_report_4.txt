{
  "purpose": "The code defines interface classes and attributes for documentation purposes, related to form validation and data conversion.",
  "sources": "Class initializers, attribute definitions, method definitions, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is processed from untrusted sources or sent to untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; the code only defines interfaces and attributes without executing data processing or communication.",
  "anomalies": "The `__init__` and `__call__` methods in `IDeclarative` are defined without `self` parameters, which is syntactically invalid in Python, indicating possible incomplete or incorrect implementation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The code uses docstrings and class structures without executing external code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely interface and attribute definitions, intended for documentation or type hinting. The missing `self` parameters in `IDeclarative` methods suggest incomplete or improperly written code but do not imply malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is evident. There are no runtime operations, network calls, or external data handling. The absence of executable logic limits the ability to identify malicious behavior, but the structure does not inherently contain any.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of interface definitions for form validation and schema description, with some syntactic issues in method definitions. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in the provided code. The code’s purpose is to define data structures and method signatures for other components.",
