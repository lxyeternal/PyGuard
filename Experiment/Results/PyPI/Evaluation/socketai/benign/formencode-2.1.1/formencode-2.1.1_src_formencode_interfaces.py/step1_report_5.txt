  "purpose": "Define interfaces and attributes for form validation and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__), attribute definitions, method definitions (to_python, from_python, message).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data; the code primarily defines data structures and method signatures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is mainly structural and informational.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code is documentation-oriented with no actual data processing or external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code defines interface classes and attribute descriptors intended for form validation. There are no data processing, external calls, or security-sensitive operations. Method signatures are defined but not implemented, indicating this is meant for documentation or abstract base classes. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a structural or documentation scaffold for form validation interfaces and attributes. It does not perform any data handling, external communication, or processing that could be malicious. No security risks are detected.",
