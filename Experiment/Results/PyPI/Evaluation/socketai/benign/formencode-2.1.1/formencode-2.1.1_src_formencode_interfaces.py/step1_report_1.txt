  "purpose": "Define interfaces and attributes for form validation and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, __init__ and __call__ method signatures, class variable declarations, and docstrings.",
  "fires": "No explicit untrusted data sources or input handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Methods (__init__, __call__, to_python, from_python, message) are defined with missing 'self' parameter, indicating incomplete or non-standard method signatures. The code contains docstrings but lacks implementation details, suggesting placeholder or interface code rather than executable logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several interface classes and attributes for form validation, with descriptive docstrings. The __init__ and __call__ methods lack 'self' parameters, which suggests they are intended as abstract methods or interfaces, but they are improperly formatted, which might cause runtime errors in actual use. No untrusted input handling, data leaks, or malicious behavior is evident. There are no external data sources, network calls, or side effects. The code appears to be a structural outline, not an operational script. No obfuscation or malware patterns are present. The structure and content do not indicate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of interface definitions and attribute declarations for a form validation framework. It contains no executable logic, untrusted data processing, or malicious behavior. The main concern is the incorrect method signatures which suggest incomplete implementation rather than malicious activity. Overall, the code poses no security risk.",
