{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of interface classes and attributes for form validation and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, method definitions with docstrings, and constructor parameters.",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted data handling or external input/output operations are present, thus no direct data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable data flows involving untrusted sources; the code primarily defines data structures and interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard class and method structures with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code solely provides interface and attribute definitions for form validation frameworks. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or sensitive operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The presence of docstrings indicates documentation intent rather than executable logic with side effects. Overall, the code appears to be standard, non-malicious interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of interface and attribute definitions for form validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be purely documentation and interface scaffolding.",
