{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package using setuptools for distribution.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the static string documentation comment and the import of setuptools.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to any sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a docstring and a minimal setup invocation; no unusual code, secrets, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and executes setup() with default parameters, indicating a standard package setup process. The docstring describes 'FormEncode' but does not perform any runtime validation, data handling, or network activity. No hidden or suspicious code segments are present. The minimal code structure suggests a benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
