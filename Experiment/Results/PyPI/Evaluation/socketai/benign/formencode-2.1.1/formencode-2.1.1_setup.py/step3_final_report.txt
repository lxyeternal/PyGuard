{
  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for packaging a Python project, importing setuptools and calling setup().",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files, send data over network, or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script executes setup() with no external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script with a descriptive docstring. It imports setuptools and calls setup() without any additional parameters or dynamic code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code does not process external data or perform network operations. All indicators point to a benign package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
