  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only calls setup() with no arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The script is minimal and standard, with no suspicious or unusual code or logic. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution detected.",
