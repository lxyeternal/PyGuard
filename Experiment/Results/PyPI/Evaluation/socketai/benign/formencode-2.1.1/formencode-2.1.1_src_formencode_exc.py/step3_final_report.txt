  "purpose": "Define a custom runtime warning class for use in larger codebases.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; class declaration only.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definition with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a custom warning class inheriting from RuntimeWarning, with an __all__ declaration. It contains no data processing, external interactions, or obfuscation. The code is simple, clear, and serves a standard purpose in larger projects. No malicious, suspicious, or security-compromising elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment. Overall, the code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward class definition for a custom warning. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
