  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and cross-examine the code and the reasoning.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward class definition with no data processing, input/output, or external interactions.\n   - The code only defines a custom warning class `FERuntimeWarning` inheriting from `RuntimeWarning`, with an `__all__` declaration.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the benign nature of the code and that it serves a typical purpose in larger codebases.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - `obfuscated` scores are 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - `securityRisk` scores are 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n   - `confidence` scores are 1, reflecting high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely definitional with no malicious or suspicious behavior, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - No potential vulnerabilities are claimed or implied beyond the scope of a simple class definition.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 across reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's content.\n   - They recognize that the code is standard and harmless.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, I agree with the current scores.\n- No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard Python pattern for defining a custom warning class. It poses no security or malware risks, and the reports correctly reflect this. The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
