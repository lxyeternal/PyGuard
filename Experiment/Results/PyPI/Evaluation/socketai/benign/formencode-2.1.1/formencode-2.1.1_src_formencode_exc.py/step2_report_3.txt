  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward class definition with no input/output, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The code does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The class `FERuntimeWarning` inherits from `RuntimeWarning` and is declared in `__all__`, serving as a custom warning class.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code's purpose.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The conclusions are appropriate: the code is benign and typical for defining custom warnings.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `malware`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `confidence`: 1 or 1.0\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5.\n   - Since the code is purely definitional, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified without evidence of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware` score as 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unwarranted assumptions.\n   - The analysis is cautious and based solely on the code content.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nGiven the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious or malicious elements, the scores are appropriate. The code serves a standard purpose within a larger package and does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a benign, standard Python snippet defining a custom warning class.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at **0**.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
