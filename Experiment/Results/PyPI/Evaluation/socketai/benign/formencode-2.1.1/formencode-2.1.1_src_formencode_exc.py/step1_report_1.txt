  "purpose": "Define custom runtime warning class for a Python package/module.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; no external data reading or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious or unusual constructs; only a class definition with a docstring and __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class 'FERuntimeWarning' inheriting from RuntimeWarning, with a docstring. It also declares '__all__' to specify exported symbols. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. No obfuscated or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of a custom warning class. It does not contain malware, security issues, or obfuscation. It serves a typical purpose within a larger package for specialized warnings.",
