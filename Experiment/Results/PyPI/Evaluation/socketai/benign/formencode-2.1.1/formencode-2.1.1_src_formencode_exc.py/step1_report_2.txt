  "purpose": "Defines a custom runtime warning class for use in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; the code only declares a class and a list.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely creates a custom warning class inheriting from RuntimeWarning, and declares it in the __all__ list. It serves as a component for signaling specific runtime warnings in a larger codebase. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward and typical for defining custom exceptions or warnings.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python code snippet for custom warning declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
