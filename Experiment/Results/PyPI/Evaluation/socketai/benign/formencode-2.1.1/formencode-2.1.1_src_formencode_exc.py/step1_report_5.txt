  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class inheriting from RuntimeWarning, with a __all__ list to specify exports. It is minimal and straightforward, serving only to facilitate custom warnings. No external data inputs, outputs, or behavior indicative of malicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign declaration of a custom warning class with no malicious intent or security risks.",
