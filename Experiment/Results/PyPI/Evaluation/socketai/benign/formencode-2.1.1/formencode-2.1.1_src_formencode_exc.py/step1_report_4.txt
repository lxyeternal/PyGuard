{
  "purpose": "Define custom warning class for runtime warnings related to FER (possibly a specific module or project).",
  "sources": "No input sources; code defines a class and a module-level variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code solely declares a class and an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list '__all__' to specify exported symbols, and defines a custom exception class 'FERuntimeWarning' inheriting from 'RuntimeWarning'. The class contains no additional logic or dynamic code. There are no indications of malicious or suspicious behavior, such as data leakage, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to serve a simple purpose of defining a warning type for use elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and lacks any malicious intent or security issues. It simply defines a custom warning class for use in other parts of a larger project.",
