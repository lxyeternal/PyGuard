  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Commented out import statements, variables defining paths, extensions, themes, and project info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted input; configuration values are static or sourced from package data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mostly static assignment and package info retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code consists of standard Sphinx configuration with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file with no runtime input, external code execution, or dynamic data handling. All values are static, commented out code is benign, and no network or file operations are performed. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The only potentially dynamic aspect is obtaining the package version via 'pkg_resources.get_distribution', which is standard for project metadata. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal documentation configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
