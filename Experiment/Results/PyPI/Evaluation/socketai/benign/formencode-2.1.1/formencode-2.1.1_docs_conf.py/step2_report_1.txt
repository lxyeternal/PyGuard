  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing is present.\n- The only import is `pkg_resources.get_distribution`, used to retrieve package version info, which is a common and safe practice.\n- The code contains no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs.\n- No network calls, system commands, or external data leaks are evident.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code is purely static configuration for documentation building.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The import of `pkg_resources` is standard for version retrieval.\n- No untrusted data sources or dynamic code execution pathways.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- Since all reports agree on benignity, and the code is straightforward, there is no reason to adjust the scores.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0.\n- The overall security risk is correctly 0.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware (0):** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** The code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk (0):** No vulnerabilities or security issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the detailed analysis, the code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe configuration file with no malicious or security concerns. All scores are justified as 0, reflecting its benign nature.",
