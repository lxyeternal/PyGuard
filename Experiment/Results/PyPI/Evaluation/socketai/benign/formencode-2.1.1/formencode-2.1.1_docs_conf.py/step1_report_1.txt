  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation using Sphinx for the FormEncode project.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration parameters, importing 'pkg_resources' to get package version.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no execution of untrusted code, no data leaks or external calls observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from static variables and imported modules; no untrusted data input or dynamic code execution pathways identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code structures. The import of 'pkg_resources' is standard for version retrieval; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with typical settings: defining extensions, paths, project info, and output options. No user input parsing or dynamic execution occurs. All imported modules are common and used legitimately for version info. No suspicious patterns, external network calls, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration file for documentation building with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
