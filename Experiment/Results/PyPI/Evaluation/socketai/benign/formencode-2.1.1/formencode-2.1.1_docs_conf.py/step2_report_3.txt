  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- No dynamic code execution, untrusted input, network calls, or obfuscation are present.\n- The only potentially dynamic aspect is the import of `pkg_resources.get_distribution` to obtain the package version, which is a common and safe practice.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, benign code, standard usage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Fully reasonable. No change needed.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard configuration, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard static configuration, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, no malicious code, static configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, benign configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation of Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence is high (1) across all, justified by the straightforward, static nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n- The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic or malicious components.\n- The only dynamic aspect is retrieving the package version via `pkg_resources`, which is standard and safe.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Scores (My Judgment):**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this as a standard, benign configuration file with no security concerns. The scores reflect this accurately, and no changes are necessary.",
