  "purpose": "Configuration file for building the FormEncode project's documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Reads project metadata, package version info, and Sphinx configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; mainly static configuration parameters and imports.",
  "flows": "Imports package version info for documentation; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; all code is standard configuration with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely configuration for Sphinx documentation generation. It includes standard import statements, setting variables, and defining documentation build options. The only import is from 'pkg_resources' to get the package version, which is standard and safe. No input reading, no network operations, no code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard configuration file for documentation purposes. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.",
