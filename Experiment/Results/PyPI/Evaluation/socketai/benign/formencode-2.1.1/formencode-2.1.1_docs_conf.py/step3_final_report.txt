  "purpose": "Static configuration for Sphinx documentation build, with no dynamic or untrusted code.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources.get_distribution to retrieve package version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or dynamic execution present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Sphinx configuration file, containing only variable assignments, comments, and a single import of pkg_resources for version retrieval. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, user inputs, or obfuscation techniques. The import of get_distribution is a common pattern for version info, not suspicious. No secrets, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are present. The code structure is clean, and all signals point to benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly identified its safe nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. No adjustments are necessary.",
