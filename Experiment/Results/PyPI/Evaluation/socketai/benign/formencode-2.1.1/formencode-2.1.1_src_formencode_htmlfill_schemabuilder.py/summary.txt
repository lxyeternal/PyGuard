  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for form schema extraction and validation setup. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities are evident. The dynamic validator instantiation poses minimal risk given controlled validator classes. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting a very low threat level."
