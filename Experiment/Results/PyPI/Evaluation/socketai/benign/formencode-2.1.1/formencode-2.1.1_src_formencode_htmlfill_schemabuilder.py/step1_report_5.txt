{
  "purpose": "This code extends the functionality of the htmlfill library to parse schema-defining statements from HTML forms and build validation schemas.",
  "sources": "User-provided HTML form input in the parse_schema function; form data fed into htmlfill.FillingParser; attributes from HTML tags during schema building.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks that handle untrusted data, but potential vulnerabilities in schema handling or validation logic could lead to security issues if malicious input is processed improperly.",
  "flows": "Input HTML form → htmlfill.FillingParser.feed() → SchemaBuilder.listen_input() → schema fields with validators",
  "anomalies": "Use of get_attr without validation may lead to injection if malicious HTML is processed; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code detected; use of dynamic class retrieval with getattr, but controlled by predefined validators.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles parsing HTML form structures to build validation schemas using provided validators and htmlfill. It uses standard Python practices for dynamic class instantiation and attribute extraction. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The potential security concern lies in processing untrusted HTML input, but the code itself does not perform unsafe operations such as executing arbitrary code, connecting over the network, or handling sensitive data directly. The use of get_attr, if fed malicious attributes, could theoretically cause issues if validator classes are compromised, but with controlled validator classes, this risk is minimal. Overall, the code appears standard and safe, with no malicious intent or security risks observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard form schema parser that leverages existing validators. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. Risks are limited to the potential misuse of input data, which is outside the scope of this code. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present.",
