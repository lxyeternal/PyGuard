{
  "purpose": "This module extends htmlfill to parse schema-defining statements within HTML forms, allowing schema extraction and validation setup.",
  "sources": "Input HTML form string fed into parse_schema(), attribute retrieval in listen_input(), and message parameter inputs.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no direct or indirect use of untrusted data in a way that causes data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "HTML form data -> parse_schema() feeds form into FillingParser -> listen_input() processes form attributes -> schema is constructed; no external untrusted data is executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. Use of get_attr() and validators appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard schema parsing and validation setup for HTML forms. It employs normal data handling methods, dynamic class instantiation for validators, and parsing of form attributes. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No suspicious external network connections or backdoors are present. The only dynamic behavior involves instantiating validator classes based on form attributes, which is a typical pattern for validation libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical schema parser and validator setup with no malicious or security-compromising behavior detected. It safely processes form data and constructs validation schemas. No indications of malware or supply chain security risks are present.",
