  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for parsing HTML forms into validation schemas, allowing schema extraction and validation setup without executing malicious code or external system interactions.",
  "sources": "HTML form strings and their attributes, accessed via get_attr() during parsing.",
  "sinks": "Construction of schema objects and validator instances, mainly within the schema and validators modules.",
  "flows": "HTML form input data flows into schema fields and validator instantiations based on form attributes, with no external data or system calls involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; dynamic validator creation is controlled via a predefined validators module, not influenced directly by untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward schema parser that dynamically instantiates validators based on form attributes, relying on a controlled set of validator classes. It does not perform external network operations, code execution, or data exfiltration. The use of get_attr() to read form attributes and the dynamic creation of validators is standard, assuming the validator module is secure. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. Potential risks include manipulation of form attributes to influence validator types, but this is mitigated by validation against a predefined validator list. The code's structure and behavior suggest a low security risk, with no malware detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for form schema extraction and validation setup. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities are evident. The dynamic validator instantiation poses minimal risk given controlled validator classes. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting a very low threat level.",
