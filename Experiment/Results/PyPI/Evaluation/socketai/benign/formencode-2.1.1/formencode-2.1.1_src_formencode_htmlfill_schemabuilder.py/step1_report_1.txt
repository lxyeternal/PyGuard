{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and a class for parsing HTML forms to extract schema information and apply validators.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from HTML form strings passed to parse_schema() and form attribute values processed within SchemaBuilder.listen_input().",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be involved in attribute extraction and validator configuration, but no direct sink like network transmission or file modification is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from HTML form input strings into the parse_schema() function, through the SchemaBuilder class and its listen_input method, ultimately constructing a schema object with associated validators.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are observed. The code appears to perform standard parsing and validation setup. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for parsing HTML forms into schemas and configuring validation rules based on form attributes. The functions handle input attributes safely and instantiate validators accordingly. The schema object is built without any direct external system calls, network activity, or file operations. Validator creation and schema management appear straightforward and intended for form validation purposes. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard form schema parser and validator setup utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware. The overall security risk is minimal.",
