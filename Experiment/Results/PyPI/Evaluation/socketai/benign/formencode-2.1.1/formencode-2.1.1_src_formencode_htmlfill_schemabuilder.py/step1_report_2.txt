{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities to parse HTML forms and extract schema definitions, including schema validation and form handling functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML form input data via 'feed' method in parse_schema, and attributes from HTML tags through parser.get_attr.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities are present in the code.",
  "flows": "HTML form data -> parsed by htmlfill.FillingParser -> processed in SchemaBuilder methods -> added to schema object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Use of validators appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines form schema parsing and validation logic, including handling of input attributes, validation rules, and form message processing. Functions such as parse_schema parse HTML forms using htmlfill.FillingParser, and SchemaBuilder constructs validation schemas. The code employs standard validation patterns and attribute handling without dynamic code execution or external network interactions. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or external communication, are evident. Overall, the implementation appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard form schema parsing and validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes HTML form data and constructs validation schemas securely without external dependencies or unsafe practices.",
