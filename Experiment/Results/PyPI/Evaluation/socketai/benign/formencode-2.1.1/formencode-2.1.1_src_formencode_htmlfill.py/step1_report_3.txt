{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse and fill HTML forms with default values and display errors, supporting form rendering with validation feedback.",
  "sources": "The code reads form templates (HTML strings) via methods like feed() and handle_starttag(), handle_endtag(), and accesses defaults and errors via instance variables such as self.defaults and self.errors.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include insert_at_marker(), write_text(), write_tag(), set_attr(), and add_class(), which inject or modify HTML content, especially error messages and form field values.",
  "flows": "Data flows from defaults and errors (sources) into HTML output through methods like handle_input(), handle_textarea(), handle_select(), and handle_option(), which modify attributes and insert error messages into the HTML template.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard form parser with filling capabilities. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network interactions are present. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior is evident. The only notable behavior is the insertion of error messages and pre-filling form data, which are standard features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive HTML form parser that enhances form templates with default values and inline errors, employing methods to handle various HTML elements and attributes. It uses standard techniques for form filling and error display, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The error message formatting functions are safe, and the parser's design is consistent with typical form handling libraries. There are no indications of code injection, data leaks, or backdoors. The code's complexity and structure align with its purpose of HTML form rendering, and it relies solely on safe string and HTML manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate form rendering utility with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It securely handles form data and errors for display purposes, with standard practices and no suspicious behaviors detected.",
