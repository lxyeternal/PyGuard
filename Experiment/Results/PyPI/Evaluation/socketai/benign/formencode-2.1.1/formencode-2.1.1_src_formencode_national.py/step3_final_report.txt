{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation and normalization routines for country names, postal codes, phone numbers, states, and languages, primarily for internationalization purposes. It relies on external libraries (pycountry, turbogears.i18n) with fallback mechanisms, regex patterns, and predefined data structures to perform input validation and conversion.",
  "sources": "User input fields such as country names, postal codes, phone numbers, state codes, and language identifiers; external libraries (pycountry, turbogears.i18n); internal data structures and regex patterns.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions raising exceptions (Invalid) on invalid input; data returned in standardized formats; no external system calls or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user input through validation methods, regex matching, and lookup functions, resulting in either normalized output or exceptions if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Warnings about missing dependencies are benign. No obfuscation or code injection present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of validation classes for country, postal code, phone number, state, and language data. It uses conditional imports and version detection for external libraries, regex for pattern matching, and internal data for validation. No network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure is clear, and the purpose is solely data validation and normalization. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured set of validation utilities for international address and contact data. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to dependency handling, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious activity.",
