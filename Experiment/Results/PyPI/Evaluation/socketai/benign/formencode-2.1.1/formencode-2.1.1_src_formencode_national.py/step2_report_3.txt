  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores, and to verify the code's security posture.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive set of validators for country, postal code, phone, and language, relying on external libraries (pycountry, turbogears.i18n). No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no network activity, benign warnings.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as validation logic with external dependencies, no malicious operations, and standard practices. The confidence level (0.95) is high, and malware score (0) aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Verdict:** The malware score should remain **0**. The obfuscated score is **0**. The security risk is low, about 0.1, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the validation purpose, external dependencies, and the benign nature of warnings. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns well with the code. The confidence (0.9) and malware score (0) are appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** No change needed. Malware score **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0.1**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the validation functions, regex patterns, external libraries, and the absence of malicious activity. No network calls or code injection.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a validation library, not malicious. The malware score should be **0**.\n\n- **Verdict:** Confirmed. Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0.1**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, highlights the use of external libraries, regex, and safe validation logic. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The malware score remains **0**.\n\n- **Verdict:** No change. Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0.2** (slightly higher but still low).\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, validation functions, external dependencies, regex, no malicious activity, safe practices.\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is appropriate. Malware score **0**.\n\n- **Verdict:** No change. Malware **0**, obfuscated **0**, risk **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Consolidated Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on **0**. The code contains no malicious routines, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports report **0**, which is accurate; the code is clear and structured.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern. Given the code's purpose and no malicious activity, a conservative but accurate estimate would be **0.1** to **0.2**.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is transparent)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** (standard validation code with external dependencies; benign warnings)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and conservative. No malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the security risk is minimal, primarily due to dependency handling and validation logic.\n\n**Recommendations:** No changes needed. The code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
