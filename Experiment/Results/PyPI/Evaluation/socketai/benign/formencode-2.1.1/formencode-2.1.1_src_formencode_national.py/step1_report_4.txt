{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of country-specific validators, postal code validators, phone number validators, and language validators for form validation, utilizing external libraries like pycountry and turbogears.i18n if available.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (e.g., country codes, postal codes, phone numbers, language names), uses external libraries (pycountry, turbogears.i18n) for data lookup and localization.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable code when handling untrusted input in regex matching and string manipulation, but no direct sinks for data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user-provided values into validation functions, which then process and convert data; external library calls (get_countries, get_languages, get_country, get_language) use external data sources, but no untrusted sources are manipulated directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials or secrets. Use of dynamic regex and external libraries is standard for such validators. The warnings about missing dependencies could be misused to trigger warnings but do not impact security. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple country, postal code, phone number, and language validators, many of which rely on external libraries (pycountry, turbogears.i18n). External libraries are conditionally imported, and the code handles their absence gracefully. Validation logic mainly involves regex matching, string transformations, and data lookups. There are no indications of malicious activity such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The dynamic regex-based transformations are standard for input validation. The warnings about missing dependencies are benign. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are found. The overall structure is consistent with validation library code, with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of validation utilities for country, postal code, phone number, and language inputs. It relies on external libraries for localization and data lookup but does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malware indicators are present. Overall, the code appears safe and intended solely for input validation purposes.",
