{
  "purpose": "The code is a module that imports various components from the formencode package and defines a version retrieval method, setting the module's __version__ attribute.",
  "sources": "Imports from importlib.metadata or pkg_resources, and internal module components such as formencode.api, formencode.schema, formencode.compound, formencode.foreach, formencode.validators, formencode.national, and formencode.variabledecode.",
  "sinks": "The only data flow involves the retrieval of the package version and the exposure of imported components; no external data inputs or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The version function retrieves package version info from the environment or package metadata; no user input, external data, or untrusted sources are involved, and no data is sent or received beyond internal module operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The version detection code is standard for package modules and includes fallback mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules necessary for package functionality and handles version retrieval with fallback logic for older Python versions. It does not include any untrusted input sources, nor does it execute any untrusted code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The logic is straightforward and standard for package modules. The fallback to get_distribution or default 'local-test' version is typical and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package import and version setup script with no malicious behavior detected. It is typical for Python modules and does not pose security risks.",
