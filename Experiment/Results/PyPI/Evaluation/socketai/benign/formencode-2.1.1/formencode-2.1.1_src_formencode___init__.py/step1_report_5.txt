{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to import and expose components of the formencode package, manage version retrieval, and define module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard libraries (importlib.metadata, pkg_resources), and local module components (formencode.api, formencode.schema, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly imports modules and assigns version information.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code only retrieves version info and re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The version retrieval fallback is standard practice for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module setup tasks: importing modules, handling version info, and defining exports. The fallback for version retrieval is common for compatibility with older Python versions. No suspicious patterns or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module setup script for the formencode package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
