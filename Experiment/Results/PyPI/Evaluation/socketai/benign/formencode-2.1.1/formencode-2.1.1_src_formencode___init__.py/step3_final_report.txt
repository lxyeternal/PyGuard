{
  "purpose": "This code manages module imports, determines package version, and exposes components for the 'formencode' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'importlib.metadata' or 'pkg_resources', version retrieval calls, and module imports from 'formencode'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external network or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "Version detection source flows into setting '__version__'; module imports and exports via '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the package version using standard Python practices with fallbacks, then imports and exposes various components. It contains no malicious, suspicious, or obfuscated code. The fallback to 'local-test' is typical for development environments. No external data handling or network activity is present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe module initialization script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the risk score should also be 0, reflecting the code's harmlessness.",
