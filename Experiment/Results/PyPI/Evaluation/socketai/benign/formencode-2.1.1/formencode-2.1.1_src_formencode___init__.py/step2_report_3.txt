  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code imports modules and determines the package version, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n- **Notes:** The reasoning is sound; no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard version detection and module imports.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, possibly due to fallback logic, but still very low.\n- **Notes:** The fallback to 'local-test' is common in development environments and not malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the code, focusing on version detection and module imports.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Notes:** No suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing benign setup for package versioning.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Notes:** Standard practice.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is a typical module setup with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module responsible for importing components and determining the package version.\n- **Malware Concerns:** None detected across all reports. The code does not perform any external communication, handle untrusted data, or execute suspicious operations.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Risk Level:** Very low; the only minor concern is the fallback to 'local-test' in version detection, which is standard in development setups, not malicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is a standard, benign module initialization snippet typical for Python packages, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
