{
  "purpose": "The code defines a declarative object framework using metaclasses and decorators, allowing class instances to be created with flexible argument unpacking and singleton behavior, mainly for use in declarative programming patterns.",
  "sources": "Reads class attribute definitions, constructor arguments (__init__), and method calls within class instantiation and attribute assignment.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks related to untrusted data or system effects; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor arguments and class attribute definitions into instance attributes, with no external untrusted data sources involved. The flow is primarily within class instantiation and attribute setting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code extensively uses dynamic features like copy, reflection, and metaclasses, but these are typical for such frameworks. No malicious code like data exfiltration, network access, or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a declarative class framework with custom metaclass (DeclarativeMeta) and decorators to facilitate flexible class instantiation, singleton pattern, and class metadata. It provides mechanisms for unpacking arguments, copying attributes, and dynamic method binding. No external data input, network activity, or system modification is evident. The code is complex but adheres to normal design patterns for metaclasses and class decorators, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a declarative class system with flexible argument handling and singleton support. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard pattern for frameworks requiring declarative object definitions.",
