  "securityRisk": 0.1,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "purpose": "Defines a declarative object system for form encoding with class and instance methods, singleton patterns, and customizable initialization and representation.",
  "sources": "Constructor arguments, class attributes, method parameters, attribute assignments, dynamic class and method creation.",
  "sinks": "Attribute setting, method calls, object instantiation, string representations.",
  "flows": "Input args and keyword arguments flow into attribute assignments and object creation; dynamic features enable flexible class behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class creation, method wrapping, singleton pattern, and flexible argument unpacking are typical in frameworks but could be misused if extended maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code employs advanced Python features such as metaclasses, decorators, singleton patterns, and dynamic attribute copying. No embedded malicious code, network activity, or secrets are present. The complexity is consistent with a framework designed for declarative class management. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected. The low security risk score reflects the potential for misuse of dynamic features but does not indicate actual malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, complex framework for declarative class management. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are justified and align with the detailed analysis.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
