{
  "purpose": "Define a declarative object system with custom class and instance behaviors, including class initialization, singleton management, and representation methods.",
  "sources": "Input data reading occurs via constructor arguments, class attributes, and method calls. No external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious output. No network, file, or sensitive data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves object instantiation, attribute setting, class initialization, and representation methods, with internal copying and method calls. No data flows from external untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code structure and method implementations are standard for a declarative class system. The use of dynamic class creation and singleton pattern is typical in metaclass-based designs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a flexible declarative class framework with custom metaclass handling, singleton support, and dynamic attribute management. There is careful handling of unpacked arguments and class initialization. No obfuscated language features, code injection points, or suspicious behavior are apparent. It does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The mechanisms for singleton management and class initialization appear benign and are consistent with pattern implementations. The code mainly facilitates class behavior customization without external dependencies or hidden malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a declarative object system with singleton and class initialization features. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The overall design appears benign and focused on object management.",
