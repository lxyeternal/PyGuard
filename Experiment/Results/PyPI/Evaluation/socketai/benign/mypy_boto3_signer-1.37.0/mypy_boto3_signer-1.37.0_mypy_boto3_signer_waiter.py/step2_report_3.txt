  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential issues, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code is for type annotations and documentation, with no suspicious elements.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious or suspicious behavior, straightforward subclass with no dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  **Verdict:** Fully reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, correctly identifies the code as a type annotation wrapper.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; code is standard SDK stub with documentation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  **Verdict:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, focused on class and method definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior; purely type annotations and documentation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  **Verdict:** Correct as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on type annotations and documentation, no external data or code execution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risk; standard SDK stub.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, with notes on potential untrusted input via kwargs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** While kwargs could theoretically carry untrusted data, the method only delegates to the superclass without processing or executing it. No signs of malicious code or security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected in any report.  \n- **Risk score:** All are low, justified by the code being purely type annotations and class definitions with no external or dynamic behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and well-documented.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk, no external data handling, no dynamic code execution.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-documented type stub for AWS Signer waiters. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
