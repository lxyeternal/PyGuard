{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and a custom waiter class for the AWS Signer client, facilitating better type checking and code completion.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class method parameters, and docstrings referencing external documentation.",
  "sinks": "The wait() method could potentially receive untrusted input via kwargs that may be used in API calls, but as written, it only delegates to a superclass method without directly executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data in kwargs passed to wait() could flow into API request parameters, but the method simply calls the superclass method with these parameters, and no data is processed or transmitted within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and primarily consists of class and method definitions with documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a subclass of Waiter with a wait() method that accepts parameters based on DescribeSigningJobRequestWaitTypeDef. It includes type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility. The class and method serve as a type-safe wrapper for AWS SDK waiters, with documentation links for reference. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be a standard, well-documented type annotation setup for AWS SDK waiters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate type annotation and subclass definition for a boto3 AWS Signer waiter. It does not contain malicious code or security risks. It is a well-structured, documented, and standard implementation for type safety.",
