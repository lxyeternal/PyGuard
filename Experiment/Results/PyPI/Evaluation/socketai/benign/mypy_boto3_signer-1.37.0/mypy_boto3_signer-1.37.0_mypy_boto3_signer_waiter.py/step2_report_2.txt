  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and documentation for a boto3 Signer waiter class.\n- Content: Imports, class definition, documentation links, no dynamic code or data handling.\n- Conclusion: No malicious or suspicious elements detected.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward, mainly for type annotations and documentation. No issues or malicious elements are present. The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and class for signer waiters, handling successful signing jobs.\n- Content: Imports, class, wait method, documentation links.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, just class/type annotations.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is purely structural, with no execution of untrusted data or external calls. The risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and documentation for the Signer waiter class.\n- Content: Imports, class, wait method, documentation.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious behavior; purely SDK wrapper.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports. No issues detected. The risk score remains appropriate at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and documentation for SignerClient waiter.\n- Content: Imports, class, wait method, documentation.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity, standard SDK stub.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo malicious elements or suspicious behavior. The score of 0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and wrapper for AWS Signer waiters.\n- Content: Imports, class, wait method, documentation.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious behavior; standard, documented code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is a typical SDK wrapper with no malicious intent. The risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe code that is solely for type annotations, class definitions, and documentation purposes.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** None of the reports indicate any malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security risk:** The code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications, nor does it process untrusted data in a way that could cause harm.\n- **Scores consistency:** All assigned scores are consistent with the code descriptions and the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 for all reports; no security risks identified.\n\n### My own estimate:\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is standard, documentation-focused, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis supply chain incident appears benign and safe.",
