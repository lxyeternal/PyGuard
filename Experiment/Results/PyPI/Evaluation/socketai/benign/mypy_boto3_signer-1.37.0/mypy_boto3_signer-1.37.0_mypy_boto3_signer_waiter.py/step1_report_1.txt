  "purpose": "Type annotations and documentation for a boto3 Signer service client waiter class.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and a local type_defs module; code annotations and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior. Use of conditional imports for type hints is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a subclass of Waiter with a documented wait() method that accepts parameters typed via Unpack. It includes version-dependent imports and documentation links. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-documented, and standard implementation of a boto3 waiter subclass for type annotations. No malicious or suspicious elements identified.",
