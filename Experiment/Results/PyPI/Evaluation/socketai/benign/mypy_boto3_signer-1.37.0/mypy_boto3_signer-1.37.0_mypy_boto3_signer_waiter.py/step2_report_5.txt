  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its purpose, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward type annotations and documentation for a boto3 Signer waiter class. No untrusted data, network activity, or malicious behavior is detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a simple subclass with type annotations, no dynamic code, or external data handling.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0, justified given the code's nature.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the class definition, type annotations, and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The detailed reasoning confirms that the code is a standard SDK stub with no suspicious elements.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, appropriate.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0, justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a subclass with a wait method, well-documented, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose as a type annotation wrapper.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—type annotations, class extension, documentation, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no external data or code execution.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides type annotations and a wrapper class, with no signs of malicious activity. The concern about untrusted kwargs is noted but correctly identified as benign, as the method delegates directly.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough and aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature—simple type annotations and class definitions with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All 0.5 or below, justified because the code is purely for type annotations and documentation, with no execution or data handling that could pose security risks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code snippets are part of a type stubs package, designed to improve type safety and IDE support, not to execute logic or handle data.\n\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n\n- The consistent, well-documented nature of the code supports the assessment that these are benign SDK interface definitions.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, just to account for the fact that any code accepting kwargs could theoretically be misused, but in this context, it's safe)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard, well-documented set of type annotations for AWS SDK waiters, with no malicious or security concern elements.",
