  "purpose": "Type annotations and documentation for a boto3 Signer waiter class, providing a typed subclass for AWS SDK waiters.",
  "sources": "The wait() method accepting kwargs of type DescribeSigningJobRequestWaitTypeDef, imported modules, class definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external system interactions; the code only defines a class and method signatures.",
  "flows": "The wait() method receives kwargs and delegates to the superclass Waiter; no external data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; use of conditional import for Unpack is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass of Waiter with type annotations and documentation links. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious. The class and method serve as a type-safe wrapper for AWS SDK waiters, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The consistent scores across multiple reports reflect the benign and standard nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented, non-obfuscated implementation of AWS Signer waiters with type annotations. No malicious or security concerns are evident. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
