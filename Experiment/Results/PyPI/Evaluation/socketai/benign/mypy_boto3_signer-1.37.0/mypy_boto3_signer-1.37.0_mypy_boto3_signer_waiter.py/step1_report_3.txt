  "purpose": "Type annotations and documentation for a Signer service client waiter class in boto3, facilitating wait operations for successful signing jobs.",
  "sources": "import statements (sys, botocore.waiter, type_defs), class method 'wait'",
  "sinks": "The 'wait' method invocation which potentially accepts untrusted keyword arguments, though it mainly wraps an AWS SDK call.",
  "flows": "User provides parameters to 'wait' method -> method calls underlying Waiter.wait with these parameters",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code mainly consists of type annotations, documentation links, and class inheritance. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of botocore's Waiter with a 'wait' method accepting parameters defined by 'DescribeSigningJobRequestWaitTypeDef'. It includes type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and extensive documentation links. No data leaks, malicious behaviors, or suspicious flows are evident. The code primarily serves as a type-safe wrapper around AWS SDK functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard type annotation and documentation wrapper for AWS boto3 waiters. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
