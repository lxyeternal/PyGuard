  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definition for signer service client waiters, specifically for handling successful signing jobs in AWS Signer.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs; the docstring sections; class methods and attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code primarily defines class structure and type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted inputs; the wait method accepts kwargs that are type-annotated, but no execution or data transmission occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class definitions and type annotations with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of sensitive data. The docstrings include external links but no embedded code or commands. No suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and class extension for AWS signer waiters. It imports necessary modules, defines a subclass of Waiter with a wait method, and uses modern Python features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is mainly documentation and type annotations for SDK usage, with no executable or insecure behavior. The only potential concern is the handling of kwargs, but this is standard for such SDK interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining a typed interface for AWS signer waiters, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a type stubs package aimed at improving code correctness and readability.",
