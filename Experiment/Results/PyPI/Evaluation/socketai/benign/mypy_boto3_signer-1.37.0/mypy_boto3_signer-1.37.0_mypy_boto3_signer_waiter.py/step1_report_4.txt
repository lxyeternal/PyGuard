  "purpose": "Type annotations and documentation for the SignerClient waiter class in boto3-stubs, specifically for the 'successful_signing_job' waiter.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definition, method definition, documentation strings, and type annotations within the code.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing, output, or external data sinks are implemented in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; code mainly defines a class and method with type annotations and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code executing dynamic imports, network activity, or data handling. The code is straightforward with standard type annotations, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code. No obfuscation or obfuscated constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Waiter with a wait method that accepts specific parameters, heavily documented with links to external documentation. It imports necessary modules and conditionally imports Unpack for type annotations. No external input processing, no network or system modifications, no code execution beyond class and method definitions. It appears to be a benign, standard SDK stub file with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and documentation setup for a boto3 waiter class, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It primarily serves as a type-annotated stub for the Signer waiters.",
