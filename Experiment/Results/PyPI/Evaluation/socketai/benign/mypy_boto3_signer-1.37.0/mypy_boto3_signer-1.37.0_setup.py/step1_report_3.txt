  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-signer' to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file to extract long description; reads package metadata and dependencies; no untrusted data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output; package configuration is static and hardcoded.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py structure; no suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools for package distribution. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, defines package metadata, classifiers, keywords, dependencies, and project URLs. No user input, network activity, or external data sources are involved. All code appears conventional and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and used for packaging the library without any suspicious behavior.",
