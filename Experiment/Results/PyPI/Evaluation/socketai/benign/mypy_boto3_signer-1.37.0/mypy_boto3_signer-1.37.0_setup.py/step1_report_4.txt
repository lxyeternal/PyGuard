{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the Python package 'mypy-boto3-signer' for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; it also accesses package data files like 'py.typed' and '*.pyi'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or written; no sinks capable of leading to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: reading a file for description, defining package metadata, and calling setup() with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of standard setup script patterns. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a local README file for description, and calls setup() with static, well-defined arguments. All data sources are static or controlled. There are no external inputs or untrusted data flows. No suspicious code constructs, obfuscated logic, or malicious behaviors are present. The package data and dependencies are explicitly defined and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe setup configuration.",
