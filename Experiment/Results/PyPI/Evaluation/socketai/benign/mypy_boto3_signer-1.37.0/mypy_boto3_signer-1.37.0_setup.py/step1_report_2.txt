  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-signer package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static strings defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data inputs or outputs, no network calls, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; all data are static or file reads, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a README file for description, and invokes setup() with well-defined package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No user input handling or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard, benign setup configuration for Python packaging. No malicious activity, no suspicious code, and no security risks detected.",
