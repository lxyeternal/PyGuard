{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-signer package, used to configure the installation of the package.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, imports setuptools, and reads environment variables for Python version constraints.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is used in a way that leads to execution or data leak.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata and description from files, then passes static arguments to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard setup script structure. No hardcoded secrets, no network connections, no code execution or dynamic code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package. It imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for the long description, and calls setup() with static metadata. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks that could be exploited, and no suspicious flows. The code does not contain any obfuscated elements or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
