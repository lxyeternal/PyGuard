  "purpose": "The script sets up and installs the 'mypy-boto3-signer' Python package, including package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; no other input sources or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or operations that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "The code reads static files and defines package configuration; no untrusted data flows or external inputs are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The script performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup process for a Python package, importing 'Path' and 'setuptools' to read a file and configure package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. It adheres to common packaging standards without any signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It only reads a local file and defines package metadata. No suspicious activities or vulnerabilities are detected.",
