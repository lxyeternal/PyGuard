  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-signer library.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data used in setup() call; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static imports, reads a local file, and calls setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign with no malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a safe, standard packaging script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
