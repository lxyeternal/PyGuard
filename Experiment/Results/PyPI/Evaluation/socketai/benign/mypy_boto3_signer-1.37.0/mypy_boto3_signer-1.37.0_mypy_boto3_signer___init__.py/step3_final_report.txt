{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface module for the AWS signer service, importing classes, paginators, and waiters, and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Static imports from local modules: .client, .paginator, .waiter",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, data processing, or network activity present",
  "flows": "N/A; static import and export setup, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future and likely a placeholder or typo",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static module that imports and exposes classes related to an AWS signer SDK. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources is present. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright date, which does not impact security. The code contains no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the placeholder date, and the malware score is zero, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the future copyright date, which is not a security issue. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
