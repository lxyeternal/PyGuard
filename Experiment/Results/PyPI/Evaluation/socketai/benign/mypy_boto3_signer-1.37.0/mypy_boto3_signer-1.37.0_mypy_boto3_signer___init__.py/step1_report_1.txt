{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for a signer service, importing necessary components and defining an alias for the client.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the module imports and the docstring; no external input handling is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is primarily static with imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The copyright date is in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines imports from local modules related to a signer client, paginators, and waiters. It establishes a class alias and exposes all components via __all__. The documentation provides usage examples for initializing the signer client and waiters. There are no dynamic code executions, external inputs, or potentially malicious patterns. The presence of a future date in copyright is suspicious but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with imports and documentation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The only noteworthy aspect is the future copyright date, which is likely a typo or placeholder.",
