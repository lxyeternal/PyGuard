  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that sets up imports, documentation, and class aliases for an AWS signer service interface.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The only unusual aspect is the future copyright date (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct, with no errors or flaws.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Security risks:** The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain secrets.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None based on static analysis; the code is a simple interface setup.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1 or 0), justified by the benign static setup, with a tiny note on the future copyright date.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The risk scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the current evidence.\n- The future copyright date, while suspicious, is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (or 0, if considering the future date as a typo rather than a risk)\n\nThis code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe module exposing an interface for AWS Signer service. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The minor note about the future copyright date is likely a typo, not a security concern.",
