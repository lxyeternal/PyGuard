{
  "purpose": "Main interface for signer service, providing imports and client setup for AWS signer interaction.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and embedded documentation.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly static imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; standard module setup, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, documentation, and variable assignments for client objects. It uses static, hardcoded class references and docstrings for documentation. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling from untrusted sources are present. The code appears to be a typical Python module designed for SDK interface exposure without any signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, benign module serving as an interface for the signer service. It contains no malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It is safe for use, assuming the underlying modules are secure.",
