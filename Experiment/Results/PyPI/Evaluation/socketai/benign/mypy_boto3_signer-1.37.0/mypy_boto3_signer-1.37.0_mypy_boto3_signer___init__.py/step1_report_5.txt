  "purpose": "Main interface for the signer service, providing access to various components like client, paginator, and waiter for AWS Signer.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter); no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only defines imports, class assignments, and __all__ exports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only sets up references and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The license and documentation links appear legitimate. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module that re-exports classes and functions related to AWS Signer. It includes a docstring with usage instructions and a license statement. No code execution, input handling, or data processing occurs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module defining interfaces for an AWS signer service wrapper. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
