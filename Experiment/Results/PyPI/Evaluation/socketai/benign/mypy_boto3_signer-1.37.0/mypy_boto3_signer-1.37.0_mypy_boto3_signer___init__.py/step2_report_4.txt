  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a module that provides an interface for a signer service, with no external input handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows; static imports and documentation.\n- **Anomalies:** The only oddity is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, importing classes and defining an alias. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, just a minor concern about the date).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard module setup with no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0, indicating no security concern.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also describes a typical interface module with no dynamic code or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the same benign structure, no data processing or network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (again, minimal).\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: standard import/export module with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports indicate any code that performs malicious actions, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns. The only anomaly is the future copyright date, which is likely a typo.\n- **Security Risks:** All reports assign very low or zero security risk scores, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation Scores:** All zero, aligning with the analysis that this is standard, boilerplate SDK interface code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low; mainly due to the future date anomaly, which is not a security issue)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign module serving as an interface layer for AWS Signer SDK components.** There are no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1    |\n\n**Note:** The minimal risk score reflects the only minor anomaly (future date), which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:** The current scoring appears appropriate. No adjustments necessary.",
