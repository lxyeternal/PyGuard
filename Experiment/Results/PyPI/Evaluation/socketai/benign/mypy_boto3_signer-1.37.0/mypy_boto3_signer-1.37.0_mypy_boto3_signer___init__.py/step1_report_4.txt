  "purpose": "Main interface module for a signer service, providing access to client, paginators, and waiters for AWS signer API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter), code comments, and documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data is processed or transmitted in this code.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignments (e.g., Client, paginator, waiter) without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is primarily import statements, type alias, and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only module import statements, documentation, and an alias assignment for the SignerClient. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data processing, no network activity, and no code execution. It appears to be a straightforward module setup with proper structure. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is well-structured and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, structural component providing an interface to AWS signer services. It does not contain malicious code or security risks based on its current content.",
