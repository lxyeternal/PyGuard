{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS signer service constants and related identifiers to enable type checking and validation in Python code.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions, imported modules (sys, typing, typing_extensions), and __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only defines constants and type annotations without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code consists solely of static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. Usage of sys.version_info for conditional import is standard practice. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard compatibility handling. It defines various string literal types for AWS services and related constants, intended for static type checking. The __all__ list explicitly declares exported names, consistent with good practice. No dynamic code, no external inputs, and no potential for malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for AWS-related constants, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a harmless, well-structured module solely for type annotations and documentation purposes.",
