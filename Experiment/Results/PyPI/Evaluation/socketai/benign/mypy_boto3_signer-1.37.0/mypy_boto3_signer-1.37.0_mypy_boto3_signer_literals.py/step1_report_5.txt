{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS signer service configurations and resource identifiers to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module; conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; definitions of string literals for types and resource names.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code solely defines type aliases and constants without any data processing, I/O, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only sets up type annotations and constants with no data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The licensing comment contains a future date (2025), but that is not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of conditional import logic for compatibility, followed by extensive definitions of string literals as type aliases for various AWS resource names, service names, and other identifiers. These serve as type hints to aid static analysis and code clarity. No runtime data handling, external communication, or obfuscated code features are present. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The use of future-dated copyright suggests a typo or placeholder but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a static configuration module for AWS type annotations, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a benign, well-structured set of type definitions to improve code quality and safety.",
