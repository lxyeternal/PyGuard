  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS signer service identifiers and related constants for type annotations and validation.",
  "sources": "Reading the type annotations and constants definitions; importing 'sys' for version check.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data flow observed.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely static definitions and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of standard type alias declarations and constants. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type literals for AWS service identifiers, regions, and other categorical types. It includes a conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling. The license and documentation comments do not influence runtime behavior. Overall, the code appears to be purely for type safety and documentation purposes, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains static type definitions for AWS-related constants, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard, well-structured, and intended solely for type checking and documentation.",
