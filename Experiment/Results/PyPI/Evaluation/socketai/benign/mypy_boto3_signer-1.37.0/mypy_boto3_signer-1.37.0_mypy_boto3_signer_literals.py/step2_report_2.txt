  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to identify any discrepancies, inconsistencies, or potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining string literal types for AWS services, regions, and related constants.\n- It uses conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The copyright year (2025) is future-dated, likely a typo or placeholder, but not a security concern.\n- The purpose is to facilitate type checking, validation, and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is static, harmless, and intended for type annotations. No issues with code logic, data flow, or security are present.\n\n- **Malware or security risks:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is accurate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  No report suggests any assumptions that could lead to vulnerabilities. The code's static nature means no attack surface exists.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines type literals for AWS signer constants.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious intent, no external data, no dynamic behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the type alias definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; static definitions for type safety.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes static string literals and conditional import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code is for static type definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no security concerns.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the static nature of the code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency & Recommendations:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, static, and for type annotations.\n- The only minor note is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo but not security-relevant.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type alias definitions intended for static analysis and documentation. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code poses no security risks and functions solely as a static type annotation aid.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Confirmed as safe, static, and non-malicious.  \n- No further action needed.",
