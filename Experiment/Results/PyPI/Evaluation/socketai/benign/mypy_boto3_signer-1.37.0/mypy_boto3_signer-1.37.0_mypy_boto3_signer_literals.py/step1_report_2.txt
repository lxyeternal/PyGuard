  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS signer service and related resource, region, and pagination identifiers to be used for type checking in Python code interacting with AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; definitions of various Literal types for AWS services and configurations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or data sinks present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is purely type definition code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be straightforward type alias definitions with conditional import logic based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version (3.12+). It then defines multiple type aliases using 'Literal' for various AWS service names, resource identifiers, pagination, waiter names, and regions. The purpose is to facilitate type safety and auto-completion in Python projects interfacing with AWS SDK. There are no dynamic or executable parts that could perform malicious actions. The code is static and purely declarative, serving as type hints.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this code. It is a standard set of type aliases meant to improve code quality and safety in Python projects using AWS SDK. No malware or malicious activity is present.",
