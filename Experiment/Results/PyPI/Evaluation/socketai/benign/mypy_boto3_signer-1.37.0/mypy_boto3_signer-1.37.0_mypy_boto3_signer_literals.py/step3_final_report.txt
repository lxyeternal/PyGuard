  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS signer service constants, resource identifiers, regions, and related categories, intended for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Defines string literals and conditional imports; no external data or dynamic input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions with no data flow or external outputs.",
  "flows": "None; purely static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright year (2025), likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string literal type definitions for AWS services, regions, and related constants, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. No dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or executable logic is present. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not pose security concerns. The code serves as a static analysis aid and documentation tool, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type annotations. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious logic, and is free of obfuscation. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.0).",
