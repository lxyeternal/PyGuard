  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS services, resource names, regions, pagination, waiters, etc.\n- It uses conditional imports to support Python versions before and after 3.12.\n- There are no dynamic, executable, or data-processing parts.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or data sinks are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The copyright date (2025) is future-dated, likely a typo or placeholder, but not malicious.\n- The purpose is to provide type safety and documentation support.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are reported issues present?**  \n  **No.** All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and safe.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not security-relevant.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk. The code is purely type annotations.\n\n- **Malware score?**  \n  All agree on 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All assessments are based on static analysis, with no assumptions about malicious intent.\n\n- **Consistency of scores?**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is a well-structured set of type alias definitions for AWS constants, used for static type checking.\n- No dynamic or executable code, no external data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The only unusual point is the copyright year (2025), which appears to be a typo or placeholder, but this does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely static, intended for type annotations, with no dynamic behavior, data flow, or external interactions. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious logic are present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign and serves a documentation and type safety purpose. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
