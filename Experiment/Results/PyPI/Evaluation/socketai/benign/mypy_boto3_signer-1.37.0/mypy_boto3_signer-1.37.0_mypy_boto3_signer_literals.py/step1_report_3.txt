  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS Signer service and various AWS service identifiers for type annotations and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values assigned to type variables; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code only defines type literals.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static definitions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a straightforward static type annotations module. The copyright year appears to be in the future (2025), which may be a typo but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations using Python's Literal type for various AWS resource and service names. It conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version. The __all__ list declares exported names. No external input, user data, or dynamic code execution exists. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious logic. The only potential concern is the future copyright year, which is not a security issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static definition module for AWS service string literals. It shows no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears solely as a type annotation aid, with no code that could be exploited or used maliciously.",
