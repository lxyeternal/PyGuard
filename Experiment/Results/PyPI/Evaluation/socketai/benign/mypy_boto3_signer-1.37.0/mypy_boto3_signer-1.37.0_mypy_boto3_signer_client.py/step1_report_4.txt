{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS Signer service client, facilitating static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; property and overload declarations.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types, especially where untrusted data might be passed via kwargs or method inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method input parameters (kwargs unpacked from request type definitions) to AWS API calls; no explicit untrusted data sources within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs observed. The code mainly defines interfaces and type annotations; no executable logic or external data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class and method definitions for the SignerClient, with extensive use of type hints, overloads, and property definitions. There are no data processing, network communication, or data storage operations within this code segment. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors, is evident. The only potential concern could be misuse of method parameters if user-provided data is not validated elsewhere, but this is outside the scope of this code, which mainly defines interface structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a type-annotated interface for AWS Signer SDK client, with no executable logic or data handling that could be malicious. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured stub/interface definition for static analysis purposes. No malicious intent or malware signs are present.",
