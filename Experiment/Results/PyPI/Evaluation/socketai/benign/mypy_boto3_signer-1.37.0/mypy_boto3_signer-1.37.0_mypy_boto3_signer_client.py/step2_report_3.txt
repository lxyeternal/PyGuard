  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states it's a type annotation and class definition for AWS Signer SDK client, with no code execution.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Focused on method signatures, property accessors, and documentation links; no runtime logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a well-structured, static interface for AWS Signer with no malicious behavior. It’s purely type annotations and method signatures for SDK interaction.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0 (no active security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type safety and standard SDK patterns.  \n- No suspicious logic, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code.  \n- Focused on method signatures, documentation, and typing.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same pattern: interface definitions, method signatures, no executable logic, no secrets.  \n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Slightly more cautious mention of potential untrusted data flow, but still within the scope of interface definitions.  \n- No code execution, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- The mention of \"securityRisk\" at 0.1 is very conservative and likely just acknowledging potential misuse if user inputs are not validated elsewhere.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, standard for interface code)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to previous, emphasizing that it's a static interface with no malicious behavior.  \n- No signs of backdoors, secrets, or malicious code.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports show no obfuscation; code is straightforward type annotations and interface definitions.  \n- **Risk Score:** The highest is 0.1 in report 4, which is very conservative given the purely static nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malware)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no active security risk; just interface/type annotations)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain security risk here is negligible. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
