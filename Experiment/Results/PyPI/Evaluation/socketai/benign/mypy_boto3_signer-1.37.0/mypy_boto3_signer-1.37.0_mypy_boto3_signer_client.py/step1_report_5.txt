{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface for AWS Signer service client in Python, facilitating type-safe interaction with the Signer API.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions, library imports, and API method definitions with parameters and return types. It sources data primarily from AWS SDK, type definitions, and runtime imports.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that invoke AWS Signer API operations, potentially sending data over the network. No direct data leaks or malicious system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are passed into client methods, which then invoke AWS API endpoints (sinks). The code flows from method calls with parameters to API request execution, but no untrusted data handling or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code strictly defines interfaces and type annotations without performing operations or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class and method declarations, type annotations, imports, and documentation links. It does not include executable logic, user input handling, or data processing. It adheres to standard AWS SDK interface patterns and employs type safety. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security-compromising behaviors. The structure and content are typical for SDK type stubs and interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a type annotation and interface definition for the AWS Signer client in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a standard, safe SDK stub meant for type checking and API interaction.",
