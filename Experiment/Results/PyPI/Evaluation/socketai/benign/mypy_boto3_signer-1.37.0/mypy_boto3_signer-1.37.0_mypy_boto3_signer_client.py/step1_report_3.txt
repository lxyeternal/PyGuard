{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the AWS Signer service, providing method signatures and documentation for interacting with AWS Signer via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class definitions with method signatures; property and method implementations with parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations with potential untrusted data handling, such as generate_presigned_url, sign_payload, and tag_resource/untag_resource which accept and process input parameters; no explicit untrusted data sinks like network calls or file writes are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through method signatures into AWS API calls; method calls such as generate_presigned_url, sign_payload, and resource tagging could potentially handle untrusted data, but the code only defines signatures without implementation details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs. The code strictly defines type annotations, property accessors, and method signatures without actual logic or data processing. Usage of 'Unpack' in type hints is standard for boto3-stubs; no obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a type annotation and interface definition for the SignerClient class, encapsulating API method signatures for AWS Signer. It imports standard libraries, sets up conditional imports for compatibility, defines an exception class, and declares the client class with annotated methods. There is no executable or malicious logic; the code's purpose is purely interface and type safety. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present. The code is well-structured, documentation-rich, and does not contain any hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign interface and type annotation layer for AWS Signer SDK operations. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security issues. It purely defines method signatures and data types for client interactions, with no evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
