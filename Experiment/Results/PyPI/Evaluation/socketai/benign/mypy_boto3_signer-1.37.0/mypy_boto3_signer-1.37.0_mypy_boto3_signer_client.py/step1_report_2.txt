{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the boto3 Signer client, facilitating type-safe interactions with AWS Signer service.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; constants and property accessors.",
  "sinks": "Methods that invoke AWS Signer operations; the generate_presigned_url method which creates URL signatures; the tag_resource and untag_resource methods which modify resource tags.",
  "flows": "Input parameters provided to client methods (e.g., add_profile_permission, sign_payload) flow into AWS API calls; generate_presigned_url constructs URL signatures based on Params; tagging methods modify resource metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or URLs; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code; method signatures follow typical boto3 patterns; no suspicious logic or side effects detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a typed interface for AWS Signer SDK operations, including class properties, method signatures, and overloads for pagination and waiters. It adheres to expected patterns for SDK wrappers, using type annotations and imports without executing any external or untrusted code. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks. All methods seem to correspond to standard AWS API actions. The presence of descriptive docstrings and references to documentation further indicates intended use as a client interface, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, type-safe SDK interface for AWS Signer with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK wrapper for AWS Signer operations.",
