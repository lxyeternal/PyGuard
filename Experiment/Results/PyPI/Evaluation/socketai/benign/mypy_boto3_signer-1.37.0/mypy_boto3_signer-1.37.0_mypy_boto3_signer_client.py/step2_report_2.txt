  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as type annotations and class definitions for AWS Signer SDK client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes that methods invoke AWS SDK operations, which is accurate.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; the code is purely interface definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified, as no active code or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar accurate description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that methods could handle untrusted data but are only signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes potential untrusted data flow but emphasizes that only signatures are defined.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets or malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes that methods could send data over network but are only signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, just interface definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, but since no actual logic or data handling is present, this might be slightly overcautious. Still, it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes potential data flow but no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no active malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are either 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a well-structured, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS Signer. It contains no executable logic, no secrets, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious activity. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no active vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review above.",
