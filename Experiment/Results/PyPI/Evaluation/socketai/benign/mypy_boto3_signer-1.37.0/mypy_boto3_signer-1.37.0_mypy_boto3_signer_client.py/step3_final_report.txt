  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS Signer SDK client, providing static type hints and method signatures for SDK interaction.",
  "sources": "Class and method signatures, import statements, documentation links, and type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to AWS APIs with parameters; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Method parameters flow into API calls; no dynamic or executable code present.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations for the Signer client. It imports standard libraries and AWS SDK components, and defines a client class with methods that correspond to AWS Signer API operations. There are no embedded secrets, no code execution, and no obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (all zero for malware and obfuscation, very low for risk) are consistent with the static, interface-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface for AWS Signer, with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no active security risks. The scores are appropriate and reflect the static, non-executable nature of the code.",
