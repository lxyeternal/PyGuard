  "purpose": "Type definitions for signer service data structures using TypedDict, annotations, and conditional imports to ensure compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Static type annotations, import statements for sys, datetime, typing, and third-party libraries.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code primarily defines data types and structures without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows or untrusted data handling; only static definitions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. The code uses standard typing constructs and documentation strings.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured type definitions for a signer service API using Python's TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for compatibility. No dynamic execution, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. All imports and type annotations are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The module appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions intended for static type checking and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely consists of type definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process or handle untrusted input at runtime. No security issues or malware signals detected.",
