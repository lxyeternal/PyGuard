  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Signer service SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and internal literals.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted unsafely.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines TypedDict classes and type aliases for AWS Signer SDK. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, no network or file I/O beyond type hints, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no obfuscated code features detected. The code appears to be purely for type safety and documentation purposes. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static set of type definitions and documentation comments intended for type hinting in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious code. It is safe and purely for type safety and code clarity.",
