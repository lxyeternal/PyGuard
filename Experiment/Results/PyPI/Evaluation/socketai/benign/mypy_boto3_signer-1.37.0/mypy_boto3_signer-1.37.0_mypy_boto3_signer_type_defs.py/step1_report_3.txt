  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Signer service request and response structures used for type safety and clarity in Python code.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only static type annotations and imports from libraries.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data; no code execution, data leaks, or external network communication present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks that could indicate malicious activity; the code solely defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is strictly for type annotations and documentation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of TypedDict and type alias definitions used for type checking in Python projects interacting with AWS Signer. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version, but does not execute any runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code's structure and content are consistent with standard SDK type definitions. The presence of copyright notice and documentation link indicates standard open-source project documentation. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe and standard set of type definitions for the AWS Signer SDK in Python. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. It is purely for type safety and documentation.",
