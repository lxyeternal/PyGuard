{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for a signer service SDK, facilitating type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type aliasing, class and variable definitions, and data structure declarations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; all data is defined through type annotations and class structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve type definitions used for API request/response modeling, with no execution or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code strictly defines types and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type definitions, import statements, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It adheres to standard Python typing practices, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation. All the code is static and focuses on schema definitions for a signer service SDK. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. External library usage (e.g., 'botocore.response') is standard for SDKs interfacing with AWS services.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions intended for a Python SDK related to signing operations. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within the provided code.",
