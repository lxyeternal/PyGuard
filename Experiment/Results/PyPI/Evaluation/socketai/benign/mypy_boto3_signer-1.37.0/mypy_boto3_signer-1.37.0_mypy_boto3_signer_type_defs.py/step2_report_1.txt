  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for AWS Signer SDK.\n- Findings: No untrusted data processing, no sinks, no data flow from untrusted sources.\n- Anomalies: None detected; purely static type definitions.\n- Analysis: The code is for static type safety, with conditional imports based on Python version. No dynamic code, no network or file I/O, no secrets.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign, purely for type safety.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for boto3 Signer SDK.\n- Findings: No data processing or execution, only data structure definitions.\n- Anomalies: None; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.\n- Analysis: Static type definitions, no runtime logic, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Benign, well-structured, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Type definitions for AWS Signer request/response.\n- Findings: No external data sources, no data sinks, no malicious patterns.\n- Anomalies: None; standard SDK type definitions.\n- Analysis: No code execution, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard SDK type definitions.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for signer SDK.\n- Findings: No untrusted data handling, no data processing.\n- Anomalies: None; no suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Static type definitions, conditional imports, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Benign, well-structured, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Type definitions with compatibility considerations.\n- Findings: No runtime data flow, no untrusted data processing.\n- Anomalies: None detected; standard constructs.\n- Analysis: Static type annotations, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Completely benign, purely for static type checking.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is purely static type definitions for the AWS Signer SDK.\n- No evidence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The code relies on conditional imports for compatibility, which is standard practice.\n\n### Malware, Obfuscation, and Risk Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0; code is straightforward type annotations and class definitions.\n- **Risk:** 0; no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Final Justification:\nGiven the comprehensive review, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions intended for static analysis, documentation, and type safety in a Python SDK. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code.\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or runtime logic, but based on this static code review, the code is safe.",
