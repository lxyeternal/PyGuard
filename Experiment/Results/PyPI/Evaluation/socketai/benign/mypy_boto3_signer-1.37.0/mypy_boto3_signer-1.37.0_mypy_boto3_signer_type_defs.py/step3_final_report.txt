  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS Signer SDK data structures and request/response types, facilitating static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, class declarations, import statements, conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "sinks": "None; no runtime data processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "None; purely static data schemas with no data flow at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard static type annotations with no suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It includes no executable logic, network or file I/O, or data handling from untrusted sources. The structure is consistent with SDK data modeling, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for static type safety and documentation purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
