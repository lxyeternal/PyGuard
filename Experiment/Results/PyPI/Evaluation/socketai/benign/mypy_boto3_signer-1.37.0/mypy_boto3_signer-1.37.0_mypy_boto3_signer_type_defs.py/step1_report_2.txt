{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the signer service in boto3, providing structured data types for request and response objects.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and local literals; class and variable definitions for TypedDict structures.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily defines data structures without processing or executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., request parameters, environment variables) to defined data types, but no active data processing or malicious flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code strictly defines type annotations and data structures, with no runtime logic or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for the signer service, utilizing conditional imports for compatibility, and defining many TypedDict classes to model request and response payloads. No code execution, network operations, or runtime data processing is present that could be malicious. The code does not include obfuscated constructs, external code execution, or suspicious patterns. It appears to be standard, well-structured type definition code intended for static type checking and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of type annotations and data structure definitions for the signer service API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured type definitions module with no active runtime logic.",
