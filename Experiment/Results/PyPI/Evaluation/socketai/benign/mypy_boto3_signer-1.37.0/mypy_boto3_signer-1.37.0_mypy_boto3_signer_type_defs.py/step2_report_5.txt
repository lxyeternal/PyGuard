  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code to determine if there are any security concerns, anomalies, or signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- It includes documentation, copyright notices, and no dynamic or runtime logic.\n- Imports are standard for SDK type annotations (e.g., botocore.response, typing_extensions).\n- No external data is processed or transmitted.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The purpose appears to be for type safety, documentation, and SDK data modeling.\n\n**Analysis of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Purpose: Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Signer SDK.  \n   - Findings: No untrusted data processing, no data flow from sources to sinks, no anomalies, no malicious code.  \n   - Conclusion: Purely static type definitions, safe, no malware.  \n   - Confidence: 1.0  \n   - Malware score: 0\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Purpose: Type annotations for signer service in boto3.  \n   - Findings: No active data processing, no network or file I/O, no obfuscation, no secrets.  \n   - Conclusion: Static type definitions, benign, no malicious behavior.  \n   - Confidence: 1.0  \n   - Malware score: 0\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Purpose: Type definitions for AWS Signer request/response structures.  \n   - Findings: No external data sources, no data sinks, no malicious patterns, purely static definitions.  \n   - Conclusion: Safe, standard SDK type annotations, no security risks.  \n   - Confidence: 1.0  \n   - Malware score: 0\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Purpose: Type annotations and data structures for signer SDK.  \n   - Findings: No data processing, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.  \n   - Conclusion: Benign, purely static type definitions.  \n   - Confidence: 1.0  \n   - Malware score: 0\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Purpose: Type definitions for signer service API.  \n   - Findings: No runtime logic, no untrusted data handling, no obfuscation, no malicious constructs.  \n   - Conclusion: Safe, static, documentation-oriented code.  \n   - Confidence: 1.0  \n   - Malware score: 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static type definitions for an SDK, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are detected.\n- The code is well-structured, uses standard practices, and is consistent with open-source SDK type annotations.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions intended for static type checking and documentation purposes. It poses no security threat or malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- No changes needed; the scores are appropriate.\n- Continue monitoring for runtime code or dynamic behavior in other parts of the SDK or application.\n\n**Work-out:**\n\n- Given the consistent findings, I agree with the provided scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is safe and purely for type safety and documentation. No further security concerns are warranted based on this static analysis.",
