  "purpose": "CLI tool that provides package information and version details for a boto3 stub package.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line argument) is checked; if '--version' is present, version info is printed; otherwise, package info is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and only handles CLI input and output.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and checks command-line arguments. When '--version' is specified, it prints the version; otherwise, it prints package details. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. No unusual or malicious code constructs detected. The code functions solely as a CLI interface for information display.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI entrypoint that outputs static package information and version details. It poses no security threats, malware, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
