  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version info based on command-line arguments.\n   - No dynamic code, external data fetching, network activity, or credential handling.\n   - No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no external dependencies beyond standard sys module.\n   - The code is well-structured, simple, and intended solely for informational output.\n\n2. **Evaluation of Security Concerns**:\n   - All reports agree that there are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic or risky operations.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n   - The code is purely read-only, static, and benign.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk score**: All reports assign 0, justified by the lack of any security concern.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores**:\n   - The scores seem appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n   - No adjustments needed; the code is benign.\n\n5. **Final Assessment**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0\n   - **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a simple CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports correctly identify it as benign. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the actual code content.",
