  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs to stdout; no data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "Command-line argument (--version) triggers print_version, otherwise print_info",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing CLI output functions for package info and version. It reads command-line input to determine which info to print. No external network access, no data processing of untrusted sources, and no code injection points are present. The functions are simple and serve informational purposes only, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package info and version. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
