{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entrypoint for a package, providing version and package information to users.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) to determine which information to display.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to standard output (sys.stdout.write). No data is sent over the network or stored.",
  "flows": "Input (sys.argv) -> Decision (if '--version' in sys.argv) -> Output (print_version or print_info)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing static information based on CLI arguments. It only reads command-line input and outputs predefined strings. No external data sources, no sensitive data handling, and no network activity are present. The logic is simple and predictable, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks.",
