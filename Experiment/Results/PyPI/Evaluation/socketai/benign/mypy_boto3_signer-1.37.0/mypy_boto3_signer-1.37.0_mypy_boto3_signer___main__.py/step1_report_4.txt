  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to stdout via sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv -> conditional check -> print_version or print_info -> stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code simply outputs static package information.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print static information, and checks for '--version' argument to decide what to output. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. It is a straightforward CLI tool intended for informational purposes. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign CLI utility that outputs package information. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It functions as a read-only informational script.",
