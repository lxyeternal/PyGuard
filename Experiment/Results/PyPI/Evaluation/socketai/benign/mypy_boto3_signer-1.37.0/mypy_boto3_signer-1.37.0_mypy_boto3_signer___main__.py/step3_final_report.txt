  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting static strings",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (if '--version') leading to print_version() or print_info() output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with no dynamic or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports only sys, defines functions to print static package info and version, and checks for '--version' argument to decide output. It performs no data processing, network activity, or code execution beyond simple output. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is purely informational and static, with no external dependencies or dynamic behavior. The analysis confirms the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious features. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
