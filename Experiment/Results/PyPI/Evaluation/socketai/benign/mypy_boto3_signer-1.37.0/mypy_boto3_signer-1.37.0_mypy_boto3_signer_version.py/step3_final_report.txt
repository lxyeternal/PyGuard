  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__ variable; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code assigns a static string to a variable without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to __version__, with a copyright comment. No dynamic code, input handling, external data, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, with high confidence. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The assigned scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
