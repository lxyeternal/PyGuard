  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   The code in question is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable, accompanied by a copyright comment.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues are present. All reports correctly identify that this is standard version declaration code with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, input handling, or external data flows. No flaws or errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n   - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n   - `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n   - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)  \n   \n   These scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores**  \n   Since the code is a static version string assignment with no suspicious patterns, the scores are justified.  \n   - **Malware score:** 0 is correct because there is no malicious activity.  \n   - **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate as there are no vulnerabilities or security issues.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as standard and benign.\n\n6. **Score Consistency**  \n   All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate, and the code is benign.**",
