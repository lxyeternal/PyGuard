  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable, accompanied by a copyright comment.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or external data flows.\n   - The code is static and straightforward, typical for version declaration in Python modules.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No reports identify any malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The version string is hardcoded and does not involve any external data or dynamic behavior.\n   - The copyright year is 2025, which is future-dated but not inherently suspicious.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it does not impact security or indicate malicious intent.\n   - No evidence suggests any hidden malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, static version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and is justified by the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
