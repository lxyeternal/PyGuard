  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**: All reports correctly identify that the code simply assigns a static version string to the `__version__` variable, accompanied by a copyright comment. There are no dynamic behaviors, no input/output operations, and no external data sources or sinks.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**: The code is standard for Python modules. The reports uniformly conclude no malicious or suspicious activity, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Obfuscation and Anomalies**: All reports note the absence of obfuscation, anomalies, or unusual patterns.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores**:\n   - The reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is 0, consistent with the lack of any security concern.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, matching the straightforward code.\n\n5. **Confidence Levels**: All reports have high confidence (1), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n6. **Additional Observations**:\n   - The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future relative to current standards but not suspicious or malicious.\n   - No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Summary & Recommendations**:\n\n- The code is a standard, static version declaration with no security issues.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code poses no security risk.\n- The malware score remains at 0.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0.\n- The risk score should remain at 0, as there is no evidence of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessments in all reports and the code's nature.",
