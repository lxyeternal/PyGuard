  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only sets a version string variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version info and copyright notice are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a copyright comment, a version variable assignment, and a metadata comment. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no external communications, or suspicious patterns. The version string is hardcoded in a typical manner for package versioning. No malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is a standard practice in Python modules to include such version identifiers.",
