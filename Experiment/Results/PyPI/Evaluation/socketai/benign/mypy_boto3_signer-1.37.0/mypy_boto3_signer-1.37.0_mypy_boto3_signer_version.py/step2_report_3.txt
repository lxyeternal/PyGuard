  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`, accompanied by a copyright comment.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, input handling, external data sources, or sinks.\n   - The code is static, minimal, and follows standard practices for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that there are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is a future date relative to the current year (2024). While unusual, it is not inherently suspicious or malicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is justified due to the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns & Assumptions**:\n   - No claims or assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is purely declarative.\n   - No external dependencies or dynamic behaviors are involved.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable. There is no evidence to justify increasing the malware or obfuscation scores.\n   - The security risk score is correctly set to 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The only anomaly is the future copyright year. If this were to be flagged, it might be for review, but it doesn't impact security.\n   - No changes are needed in the scoring.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**My own estimate for the scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, standard, and contains no security issues. The reports correctly reflect this.",
