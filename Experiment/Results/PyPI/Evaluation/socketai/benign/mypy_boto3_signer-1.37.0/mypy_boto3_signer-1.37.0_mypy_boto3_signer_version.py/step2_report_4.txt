  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the validity of their conclusions, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable, accompanied by a copyright comment.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, data inputs, external data flows, or code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The copyright year (2025) is in the future relative to current standards but is not inherently suspicious or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies the code as a simple version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0, Confidence 1 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with additional note on the future copyright year.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0, Confidence 1 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports; no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** All zeros for malware, obfuscation, and security risk; confidence at 1.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; straightforward version assignment.\n- **Scores:** All zeros; confidence at 1.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zeros; confidence at 1.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; the code is plain and readable.\n- **Security risk score:** Correctly 0; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n- **Confidence:** All reports correctly show high confidence (1).\n\n### Potential improvements:\n- The only minor note is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future. While unusual, it is not malicious or suspicious, just a potential inconsistency or typo.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.**\n- **No changes are necessary.**\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and well-justified.",
