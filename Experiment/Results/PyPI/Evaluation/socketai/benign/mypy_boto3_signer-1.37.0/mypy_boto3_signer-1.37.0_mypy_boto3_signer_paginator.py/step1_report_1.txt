  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the AWS Signer service client to facilitate paginated responses in boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module. Reads the sys.version_info for conditional imports. Class methods that accept **kwargs for pagination parameters.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code defines class structures and method signatures only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of type: ignore comments in class method overrides, but these are standard for type compatibility; no unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for paginator classes of the boto3 Signer client, ensuring type safety and clarity. It uses conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice. The class methods 'paginate' are defined with proper type hints, and the use of TYPE_CHECKING avoids runtime overhead. No external data processing, command execution, or insecure code constructs are evident. The only notable aspect is the use of 'type: ignore' for override compatibility, which is a common pattern and not suspicious. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type annotation module for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe type-annotated interface for boto3 paginator classes. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation. The implementation is straightforward and adheres to typical patterns for type hinting and conditional imports. The code's purpose is solely to improve type safety and documentation for AWS Signer paginators.",
