  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for boto3 signer service client, providing structured access to paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class methods with **kwargs for pagination parameters.",
  "sinks": "None detected. The code does not process untrusted input directly, nor does it perform network, file, or environment operations that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "The classes inherit from Paginator and define paginate methods accepting **kwargs for request parameters, returning PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors observed. The code is standard type annotations and class inheritance for boto3 paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for the boto3 signer client with proper type annotations, conditional imports, and thorough docstrings linking to documentation. It uses standard practices for type safety and conditional typing based on Python version. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or potentially malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe implementation of boto3 paginator classes with proper type annotations and documentation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
