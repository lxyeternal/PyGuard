  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3 signer service client to facilitate paginated API responses with type safety.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definitions, and class method 'paginate' which unpacks kwargs and returns paginated responses.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods use untrusted kwargs to generate paginated response iterators; no direct data sinks or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Input from kwargs to 'paginate' method flows into the PageIterator response type, with no evidence of untrusted data manipulation or leakage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. Code structure is standard for type annotations and paginator class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginator objects related to AWS Signer service. It uses conditional imports for type safety, defines paginator subclasses with overridden 'paginate' methods, and links to documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The focus is purely on type safety and API structure, with no external or network activity embedded in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation and class wrapper implementation for boto3 paginators. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It serves as a type-safe interface layer for AWS SDK paginators with no suspicious or harmful features.",
