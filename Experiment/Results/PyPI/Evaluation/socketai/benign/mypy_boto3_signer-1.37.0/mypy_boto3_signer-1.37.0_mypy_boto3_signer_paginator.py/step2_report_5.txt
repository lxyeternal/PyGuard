  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides type annotations for boto3 Signer paginators, with no suspicious behavior or security issues. It uses conditional imports, class inheritance, and type hints appropriately.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The use of 'type: ignore' is standard for override compatibility.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe type annotations and class definitions for boto3 Signer paginators. No suspicious activity or security risks.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code defines paginator classes with proper type annotations, no external data processing, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's purpose. No security concerns.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  Justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—type annotations, class inheritance, no suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** No issues or malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on type annotations, class definitions, and safe use of kwargs in 'paginate' methods. No external or malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No security risks or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is purely type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginators. No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions that could be malicious.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws:** The use of 'type: ignore' is standard in such contexts; no flaws in logic or reasoning.\n\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for Scores > 0.5:** None of the reports justify higher scores; all are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** Both are correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Estimated Malware Score:** 0.0  \n- **Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0.0  \n- **Estimated Risk Score:** 0.0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe, and well-structured type annotation module for boto3 paginator classes, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed.",
