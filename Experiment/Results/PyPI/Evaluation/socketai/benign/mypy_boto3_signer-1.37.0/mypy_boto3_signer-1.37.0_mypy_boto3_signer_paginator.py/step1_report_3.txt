{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS Signer service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe pagination.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from imported modules, reads Python version info, and checks TYPE_CHECKING for conditional class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data flows, no network operations, no file operations, and no code execution points present.",
  "flows": "No apparent data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and type annotations without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional imports based on Python version and conditional class base assignments, which are standard for type hinting compatibility. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides type annotations, class definitions for paginators, and documentation links. It uses standard Python typing features and conditional imports for compatibility. No dynamic code execution, data collection, or network activity is present. The code appears to be well-structured and intended solely for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module for providing type annotations for boto3 Signer paginators. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It is safe and primarily serves documentation and type safety purposes.",
