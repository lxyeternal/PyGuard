  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for boto3 Signer service client, enabling type-safe pagination over AWS Signer API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard library modules (sys, typing), third-party modules (botocore.paginate), and internal type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks. The code primarily defines classes and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be a straightforward type-annotated interface for boto3 paginators.",
  "analysis": "The script defines paginator classes for the Signer AWS service, incorporating type annotations for request parameters and responses. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, and type checking blocks to handle generic paginator types. No runtime data processing, user input, or external network interactions are present. No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of boto3 paginator type annotations. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It functions as intended for type safety and code clarity in SDK usage.",
