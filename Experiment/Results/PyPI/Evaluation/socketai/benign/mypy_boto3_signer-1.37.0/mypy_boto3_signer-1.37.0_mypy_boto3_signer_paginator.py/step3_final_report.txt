{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for boto3 Signer service paginators, facilitating static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; conditional import of Unpack based on Python version; class methods with **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; no runtime data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static class and method definitions with type hints; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'type: ignore' in method overrides, standard conditional import for Python version compatibility, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type annotations for boto3 paginator classes related to the Signer service. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, defines classes inheriting from Paginator with properly typed paginate methods, and includes documentation links. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or runtime data handling. The use of 'type: ignore' is typical for complex inheritance scenarios. Overall, the code is a standard, safe, and purpose-specific module for static typing and documentation, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and serves solely for static type annotations and documentation purposes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
