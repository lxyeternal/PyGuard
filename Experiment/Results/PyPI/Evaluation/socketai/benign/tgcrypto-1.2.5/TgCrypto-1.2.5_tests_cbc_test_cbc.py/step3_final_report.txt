  "purpose": "Cryptographic testing suite for AES-CBC-256 encryption and decryption, verifying correctness with test vectors and randomness, including input validation.",
  "sources": "Reads test vectors from files, generates random data, and uses tgcrypto.cbc256_encrypt/decrypt functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Test functions call tgcrypto.cbc256_encrypt/decrypt with inputs from test vectors or random data.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy use of exec() for dynamic test generation, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard cryptographic test suite with input validation, test vectors, and randomized tests. No malicious code, backdoors, or network activity are present. The use of exec() is typical in test code for dynamic generation but could be flagged as obfuscation if untrusted sources are involved. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic testing suite with no malicious intent. The use of exec() is unconventional but not malicious in this context. Scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, which are appropriate given the code's purpose and structure.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
