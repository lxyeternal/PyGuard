{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'TgCrypto' cryptography extension library used by Pyrogram.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static setup parameters, including package metadata and source files for extension modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or network operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be standard setup for a cryptography library.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, reads a README file for long description, and defines package configuration including metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and extension modules. The extension modules include cryptography source files, but no runtime or malicious behaviors are present. The code strictly adheres to standard packaging practices, with no dynamic execution, input/output handling, or network activity. No anomalies or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a cryptography library component used in Pyrogram. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no indicators of malware or security risks.",
