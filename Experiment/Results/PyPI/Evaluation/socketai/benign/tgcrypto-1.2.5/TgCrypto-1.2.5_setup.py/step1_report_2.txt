{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'TgCrypto' Python package, which provides cryptography extension functions for Pyrogram.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; no other external data inputs or user inputs detected.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or untrusted data handling observed. No data leakage or external data transmission code present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up package metadata and compilation instructions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of standard setup and extension module compilation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and extension modules. It reads a README file for description, specifies package info, classifiers, URLs, and compiles C extensions for cryptographic functions. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a standard open-source project setup script without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for a cryptography library used in the Pyrogram project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely facilitates package distribution and compilation of C extensions.",
