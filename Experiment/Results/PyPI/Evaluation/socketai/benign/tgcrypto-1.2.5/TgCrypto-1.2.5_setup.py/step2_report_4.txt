  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard setup.py script for a Python package named \"TgCrypto,\" which provides cryptography extensions for Pyrogram.\n- The scripts read a README.md file for long description, specify package metadata, classifiers, URLs, and compile C extension modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- The listed source files are typical C source files for cryptography (aes256.c, ige256.c, ctr256.c, cbc256.c).\n- All reports conclude the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of malicious code?**  \n  No. The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are the source files suspicious?**  \n  No. The source files are typical cryptographic C implementations.\n\n- **Any anomalies or suspicious patterns?**  \n  None. The code follows standard packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Issues in the Reports:\n- The reports are very consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the script as benign.  \n- They do not mention any validation of the actual content of the C source files, but given the context, this is acceptable.  \n- No claims are made about potential vulnerabilities or backdoors, which aligns with the evidence.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate given the evidence.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code is present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, as the setup script itself does not introduce security risks.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The obfuscated score remains 0 because there's no obfuscation.\n- The overall security risk is 0, reflecting the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the analysis, I agree with the provided scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**However, considering the context:**\n- The source files are cryptographic C code, which could be a vector for malicious modifications if compromised. But nothing in the setup script indicates malicious intent.\n- The package is open source, and the code appears standard.\n\n**Therefore, my overall estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- No evidence suggests malicious activity.\n- The code is a typical setup script for a cryptography extension, with no anomalies.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis setup script is legitimate, well-structured, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The provided scores are accurate.",
