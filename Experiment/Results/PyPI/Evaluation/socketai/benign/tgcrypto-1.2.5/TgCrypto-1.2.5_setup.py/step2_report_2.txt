  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the provided code and findings step-by-step.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code in question is a standard `setup.py` script for a Python package (`TgCrypto`) that provides cryptography extensions for Pyrogram.\n- All reports consistently identify the script as a typical package configuration, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks is present in the code or in the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The script reads a `README.md` for the long description.\n   - Defines package metadata (`name`, `version`, `author`, etc.).\n   - Specifies extension modules with C source files (`tgcrypto.c`, `aes256.c`, etc.).\n   - Uses standard `setuptools` conventions.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling.\n   \n2. **Potential Issues or Anomalies:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The source files listed are typical for cryptographic C extensions.\n   - The code is static and straightforward.\n\n3. **Malware or Security Risks:**\n   - The reports correctly identify no malware or malicious activity.\n   - The package appears to be an open-source cryptography extension for Pyrogram, which is legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score (0):**  \n  The code contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The extension sources are standard cryptographic C files, not obfuscated or suspicious.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):**  \n  No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk Score (0):**  \n  Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors, the risk score is appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports (all zero for malware and obfuscated, and 0 for risk) are reasonable and justified.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Personal Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a conventional setup script for a cryptography extension, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All source files are standard cryptographic C modules, and the script strictly handles package configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No further action or concern is necessary.",
