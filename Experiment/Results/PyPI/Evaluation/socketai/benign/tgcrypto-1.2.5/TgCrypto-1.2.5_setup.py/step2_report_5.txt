  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, logic, and reasoning, and cross-checking the scores.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a standard setup.py script for a Python package named \"TgCrypto,\" which includes C extension modules for cryptography.\n- The code reads a README.md for description, defines package metadata, and compiles local C source files.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The source files are typical cryptographic C files, with no suspicious patterns.\n- The overall structure and content are consistent with legitimate open-source packaging scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Setup script for Pyrogram's cryptography extension.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup for 'TgCrypto'.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Standard setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Setup for cryptography extension.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Standard packaging, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup script.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious content.\n- **Malware score:** All are zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Since there's no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities, a score of 0.5 or higher would be unwarranted.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python cryptography extension, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n- The source files listed are typical C source files for cryptographic functions, not suspicious.\n- No dynamic or network activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no runtime code execution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The provided scores are appropriate.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- The confidence level is rightly at 1, given the clear and standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Recommended Score |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                       |\n| Security Risk     | 0                       |\n\n**The reports are accurate, and the code is benign.**",
