{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'TgCrypto' Python package, defining package metadata and compiling C extension modules for cryptographic functions.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static source files listed in 'sources' for extension modules (tgcrypto.c, aes256.c, ige256.c, ctr256.c, cbc256.c).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no runtime data processing, no network activity, no user input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration script; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script follows standard Python packaging practices, reading a README for description, specifying package info, and compiling cryptographic C sources. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The listed source files are typical cryptographic implementations. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's structure and content are consistent with legitimate open-source cryptography extension packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for a cryptography extension library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
