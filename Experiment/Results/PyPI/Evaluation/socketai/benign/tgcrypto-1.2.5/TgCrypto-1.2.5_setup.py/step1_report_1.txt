{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Pyrogram Telegram MTProto API client library, including cryptography extension module configuration.",
  "sources": "File reading from 'README.md' for long description, package source files in 'tgcrypto' directory, and package metadata inputs such as URL, author, and email.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the script primarily defines package metadata and build configuration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file inputs (e.g., 'README.md') into variables, and package configuration data into setup() function, with sources and package files fed into extensions for compilation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution present. The script follows standard Python package setup patterns. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional Python setup configuration for a cryptography extension library. It imports standard modules ('setuptools') and reads a markdown file for description. Package metadata is correctly specified, and C extension sources are provided for compilation. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The focus is on packaging and building the module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python cryptography extension library associated with Pyrogram. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. All components appear legitimate and intended for secure package installation.",
