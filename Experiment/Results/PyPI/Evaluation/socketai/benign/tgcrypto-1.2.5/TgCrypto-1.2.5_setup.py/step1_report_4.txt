{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'TgCrypto' cryptography extension library for Pyrogram, including package metadata and compilation instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, and static source files for compilation (tgcrypto.c, aes256.c, ige256.c, ctr256.c, cbc256.c).",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present; configuration and metadata do not handle external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static data and source code compilation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It imports setup tools, reads a README file, and configures package metadata, classifiers, URLs, dependencies, and compilation of C extension modules. All source files are listed explicitly for compilation; no dynamic code or external input handling is present. The code adheres to typical packaging practices and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a cryptography library, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply compiles and prepares the package for distribution.",
