{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Pyrogram cryptography extension library 'TgCrypto', including metadata, dependencies, and extension modules.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static setup parameters from the code; source files listed in 'ext_modules' for compilation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; setup process compiles native extensions from listed source files.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from code to setup functions, and source files are compiled into extension modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected. The source files are typical C extension sources, not suspicious by themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for Python packaging. It imports 'setuptools', reads a README file, and calls 'setup' with metadata and configuration for building C extension modules. The extension sources are local C files, typical for cryptography libraries. No dynamic code execution, external inputs, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The license, author information, and project URLs are all standard and publicly available. The overall structure suggests legitimate package configuration with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script for a cryptography extension. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code within this configuration. The source files listed are typical C files for cryptographic operations, and no suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.",
