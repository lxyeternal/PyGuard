  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious activity. It notes the absence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes this as a typical setup script with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the review finds no anomalies or malicious intent, describing the script as standard packaging code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis confirms this is a typical setup script with no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: standard package setup, no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package with C extensions.  \n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:** No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.  \n- **Potential concerns:** Since the code is solely a setup script, and all source files are local C files for cryptographic functions, there is no indication of malicious behavior.  \n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**; no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**; code is straightforward and standard.  \n- **Risk score:** Should remain at **0**; no security risks identified.  \n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.** They correctly interpret the code as benign, standard packaging scripts without any malicious or suspicious components.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nAll reports are aligned with this assessment.",
