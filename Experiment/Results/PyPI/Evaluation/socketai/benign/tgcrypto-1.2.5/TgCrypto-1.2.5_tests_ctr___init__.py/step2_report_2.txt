  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify that the code is solely composed of license and header comments.\n- No executable code, data processing, or network operations are present.\n- No sources, sinks, or data flows are identified.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the absence of executable or malicious code.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n- The reports are consistent in their conclusions that this code fragment is benign, purely informational, and poses no security threat.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the static nature of the code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 is correct; there is no obfuscation.\n- Security risk: 0 is justified, as there's no executable code or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- Since the code is only comments, the risk scores are correctly low.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or reasoning.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is just licensing comments with no executable or malicious content.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
