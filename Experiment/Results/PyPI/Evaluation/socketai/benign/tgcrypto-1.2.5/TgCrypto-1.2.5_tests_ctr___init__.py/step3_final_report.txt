  "purpose": "This code contains only licensing comments and header information for the Pyrogram library, with no executable code or data processing.",
  "sources": "Comments and license headers at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data flow exists.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there is no executable code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and header information, with no executable instructions, data processing, or network activity. There are no source-to-sink data flows, no suspicious patterns, and no obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting the benign and informational nature of the content. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the static and clear nature of the code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely licensing comments with no malicious or security-threatening content. The scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
