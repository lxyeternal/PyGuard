{
  "purpose": "The code implements an n-gram model for character sequence analysis, including training, updating, normalization, and serialization functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from string parameters in methods like train and from serialized model data in from_dict.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data directly leads to data leaks or system effects; the code mainly processes internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings or serialized JSON) is processed through train and from_dict methods, and the normalized model is computed internally; no external output or network communication is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not include obfuscated code, hidden functions, or unusual constructs. It uses standard Python features and simple data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code models character sequences using n-grams with smoothing, allowing training and merging of models. It serializes and normalizes data for probabilistic calculations. No external network, file I/O, or system commands are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code operates solely on provided input data and internal structures, with no evident malicious intent or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of an n-gram character model with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks. It functions as a standard probabilistic language model component without external network interaction or security-sensitive operations.",
