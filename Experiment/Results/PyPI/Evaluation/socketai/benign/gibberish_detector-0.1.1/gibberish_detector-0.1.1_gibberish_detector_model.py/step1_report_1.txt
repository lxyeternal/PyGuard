{
  "purpose": "The code implements an n-gram language model for probabilistic text analysis, including training, updating, normalization, and serialization functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input strings for training (`train()` method), deserialization input (`from_dict()`), and updates from other models (`update()`).",
  "sinks": "Uses the normalized model to compute log probabilities via the `__getitem__` method. No untrusted data is sent to external systems, network, or filesystem.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by `train()` through `NGramIterator.get()`; data flows into internal `self.data`. `update()` merges models. `normalize()` converts counts to log probabilities, which are then used by `__getitem__` for probability retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Usage of `math.log()` for normalization is standard; no obfuscated code or malicious constructs detected. Smoothing factors are used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages probabilistic models using n-grams. It reads input data for training, updates internal counts, and serializes/deserializes models. No external network or system commands are invoked. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors identified. It follows standard practices for language modeling and serialization, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard n-gram language model implementation with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely within the scope of probabilistic text modeling, with no external communication or malicious side effects.",
