  "purpose": "A character-based n-gram language model for training, updating, normalizing, and serialization of probabilistic character transitions.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings during training via NGramIterator.get(line). Uses internal data structures for counts and normalization.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communication; data is processed internally and serialized via json().",
  "flows": "Source: input string -> NGramIterator.get() -> updates self.data counts -> normalization computes probabilities -> __getitem__ retrieves probabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard smoothing factor is hardcoded but common in language models.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard character n-gram model with smoothing, training, updating, normalization, and serialization. No external network calls, no obfuscation, no malicious code. The smoothing factor is a typical practice, and the code structure is straightforward. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented character n-gram language model with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The provided reports are accurate and justified. Final scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.",
