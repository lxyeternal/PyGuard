  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a standard gibberish detection method. The primary security concern is the deserialization step, which could be exploited if insecure, but no such vulnerability is demonstrated here. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the deserialization concern without active exploitation."
