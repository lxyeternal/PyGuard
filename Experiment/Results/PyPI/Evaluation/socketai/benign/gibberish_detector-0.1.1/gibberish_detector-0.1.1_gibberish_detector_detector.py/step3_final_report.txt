  "sinks": "Calculation of probabilities, potential deserialization vulnerability if serializer.deserialize is insecure",
  "flows": "Input payload -> NGramIterator.get -> model[a][b] lookup -> probability calculation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or obfuscation; reliance on external deserialization without validation",
  "analysis": "The code loads a model via serializer.deserialize, then uses NGramIterator to analyze input strings for gibberish probability. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the deserialization step, which could be insecure if serializer.deserialize is unsafe, but no evidence of malicious activity is present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The deserialization process's security depends on its implementation, but in the absence of evidence, the risk is minimal. The code does not perform network activity or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a standard gibberish detection method. The primary security concern is the deserialization step, which could be exploited if insecure, but no such vulnerability is demonstrated here. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero; the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the deserialization concern without active exploitation.",
