  "purpose": "Serialize and deserialize a Model object to and from JSON strings for storage and retrieval.",
  "sources": "model.json() method and json.loads() function reading from input payload.",
  "targets": "Model.from_dict() which constructs a Model from raw data.",
  "flows": "model.json() -> json.dumps() -> serialize output; payload string -> json.loads() -> Model.from_dict()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard usage of json module.",
  "analysis": "The code serializes a Model object to a JSON string and deserializes a JSON string back to a Model. It includes error handling for JSON decoding errors, raising a custom ParsingError. No untrusted data flows into unsafe sinks like system commands, file operations, or network communication. Usage of json library appears standard; no suspicious code structures or obfuscated logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward serialization/deserialization utility with proper error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
