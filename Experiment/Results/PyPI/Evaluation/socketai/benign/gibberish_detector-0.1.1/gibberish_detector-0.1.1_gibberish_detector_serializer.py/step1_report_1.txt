  "purpose": "Serialize and deserialize a Model object to and from JSON strings for storage purposes.",
  "sources": "json.loads(payload) reads input data; model.json() reads data from the Model instance.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps(data) outputs serialized JSON; Model.from_dict(raw_data) creates Model object from deserialized data.",
  "flows": "serialize() converts Model to JSON string -> deserialize() reads JSON string -> creates Model object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or suspicious data flows. Error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward serialization and deserialization using standard json methods. It includes exception handling for JSON decode errors. It relies on Model's methods for JSON conversion, which are not detailed here but assumed safe. No suspicious behaviors such as network calls, system modifications, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard serialization/deserialization utility with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It handles JSON data safely and efficiently without suspicious patterns.",
