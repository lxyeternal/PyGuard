  "purpose": "Serialize and deserialize a Model object to and from JSON format for storage and retrieval.",
  "sources": "model.json() method (reads Model data), json.loads() (reads JSON string)",
  "sinks": "json.dumps() (outputs JSON string), Model.from_dict() (creates Model from untrusted data)",
  "flows": "model.json() -> json.dumps() -> JSON string; JSON string -> json.loads() -> Model.from_dict()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard libraries; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple serialization/deserialization functions using Python's json library. It handles JSON decoding errors properly by raising a custom ParsingError. The functions depend on the Model class’s methods, which are assumed safe. No suspicious data flows, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is minimal and standard, with no hardcoded secrets or complex logic. The security posture is very low risk, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The security risk score is slightly above zero (around 0.1) to account for external dependencies (Model methods), but overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe serialization utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
