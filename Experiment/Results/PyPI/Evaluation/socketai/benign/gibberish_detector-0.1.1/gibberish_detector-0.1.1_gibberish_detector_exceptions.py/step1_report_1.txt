  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class ParsingError inheriting from ValueError",
  "sources": "No data sources or input reading observed in this code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points observed in this code",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, defining a custom exception without unusual or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a subclass of ValueError named ParsingError with no additional logic, input, or external interactions. There are no hidden behaviors, obfuscated elements, or malicious code present. The class could be used in larger codebases to signal parsing-related errors, but on its own, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, harmless custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks.",
