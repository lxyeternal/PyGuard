  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for parsing errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, external calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ValueError named ParsingError with no additional methods or attributes. It appears to be a straightforward custom exception used for error handling. The code is minimal, clear, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns. There are no input sources, data sinks, or flow paths that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of a custom exception class without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
