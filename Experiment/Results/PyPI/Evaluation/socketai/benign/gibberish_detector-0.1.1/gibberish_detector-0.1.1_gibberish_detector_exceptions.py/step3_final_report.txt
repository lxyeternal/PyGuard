  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for parsing errors.",
  "sources": "No data sources; class definition does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class is a simple subclass with no methods or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, minimal, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ValueError named ParsingError with no additional logic, attributes, or external interactions. It is syntactically correct, simple, and typical for custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code does not process input, leak data, or perform any actions beyond class declaration. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
