  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class ParsingError that inherits from ValueError.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; this is a class definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is simply declared without instantiation or method calls.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; the class is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ValueError named ParsingError, intended to be used for signaling parsing-related errors. There are no input sources, data flows, or sinks present. The class is minimal, with no methods or attributes. It appears to be a typical, benign custom exception class. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard class definition for a custom exception with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
