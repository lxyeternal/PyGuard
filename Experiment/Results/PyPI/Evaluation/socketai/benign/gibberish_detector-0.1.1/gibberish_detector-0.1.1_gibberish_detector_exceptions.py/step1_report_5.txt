  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'ParsingError' that extends Python's built-in 'ValueError' for error handling related to parsing issues.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are established in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward class definition with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a custom exception class, inheriting from 'ValueError', with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. It is a standard pattern for custom exceptions in Python. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition used for custom error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
