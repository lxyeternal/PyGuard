{
  "purpose": "This code implements a command-line interface for training a model and detecting gibberish text, utilizing external modules for core functionality.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, files specified in args.filename, user input via input() function",
  "sinks": "Standard output for detection results, standard error for error messages",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line args and files into training or detection functions, with results printed to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that delegates core logic to external modules. It handles errors gracefully, manages user input and output securely, and contains no network activity or code injection points. The structure is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted input, but no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. It performs standard CLI operations for model training and detection without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
