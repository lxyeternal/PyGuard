{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for training and detecting potential gibberish in text data, likely for a machine learning model.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via parse_args, and user input via input() in interactive mode.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include printing serialized models, detection results, and error messages to standard output and error streams.",
  "flows": "Source: parse_args / user input -> Sinks: print statements / input() -> Outputs: serialized models, detection results, error messages",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages model training and detection workflows. It imports local modules ('detector', 'serializer', 'trainer', 'exceptions', 'usage'), which are not part of this code snippet. The functions handle user commands and input, and output results accordingly. No data is sent over the network, and no sensitive data is accessed or stored. Error handling is limited to IO and parsing errors related to model files. The use of input() and print() for user interaction appears standard. No indication of malicious intent or malicious code behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign command-line tool for training and detecting gibberish in text data. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. It functions as expected for a CLI application without engaging in suspicious activities.",
