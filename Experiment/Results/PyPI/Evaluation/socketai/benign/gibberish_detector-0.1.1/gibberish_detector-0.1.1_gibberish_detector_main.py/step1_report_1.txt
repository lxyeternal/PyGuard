{
  "purpose": "Main entry point for a text analysis tool that trains models and detects gibberish in text inputs, with optional interactive mode.",
  "sources": "parse_args function for command-line arguments, input() for user text input in interactive mode, file operations within trainer.train and detector.create_from_model",
  "sinks": "print statements for error messages and detection results, input() for user input in interactive mode",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> parse_args -> _handle_train_action or _handle_detect_action; in detect mode, input text -> Detector.is_gibberish -> print results",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages model training and text detection based on command-line inputs. It imports local modules (detector, serializer, trainer), suggesting modular design. Error handling for file IO and parsing errors is straightforward. Interactive mode reads user input and outputs probabilities. No network communication, data exfiltration, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code does not execute untrusted code or contain obfuscated segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate command-line utility for training and detecting gibberish in text, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It securely manages user input and model files without any suspicious activity.",
