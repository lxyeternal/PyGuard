{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be a command-line interface for a machine learning model that detects gibberish text, supporting training and detection modes.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from command-line arguments (parse_args) and user input during interactive mode (input()). Model files are loaded via detector.create_from_model.",
  "sinks": "Printing outputs to stdout and stderr; no direct data leaks or external network calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line arguments and user input into detection functions; models are loaded from files specified by args.model; output is printed based on detection results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of exception handling appears standard. The code structure and logic are straightforward with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and internal modules, handles command-line actions ('train' and 'detect'), loads models from files, and performs text analysis. Error handling for IO and parsing issues is in place. The interactive mode reads user input and provides detection probabilities. There are no signs of malicious data manipulation, external network activity, or hidden backdoors. All data flows are predictable and limited to local file access and console I/O.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical command-line tool for training and running a text gibberish detector. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected; it appears safe and straightforward.",
