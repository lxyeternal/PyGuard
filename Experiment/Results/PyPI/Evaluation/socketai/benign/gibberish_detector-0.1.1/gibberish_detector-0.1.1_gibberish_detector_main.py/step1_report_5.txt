{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for training and detecting potentially malicious or gibberish text using a machine learning model.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, model files, and user input from stdin.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to stdout and errors to stderr. Loads model files and processes user input.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed, then depending on the action ('train' or 'detect'), model files are loaded or trained. In detection mode, input is read from arguments or interactively from stdin, then processed by detector methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious hardcoded URLs are present. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data leaks are evident. The code primarily handles I/O and delegates core logic to imported modules.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as a CLI wrapper around imported modules 'detector', 'serializer', 'trainer', and custom 'ParsingError'. It manages training models and performing detection on strings, including an interactive mode. All data flows are from user input or files to model processing and output. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling is observed. Exception handling is straightforward and does not process untrusted data insecurely. The code appears benign and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI interface for training and detection tasks related to gibberish detection, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external modules for core logic, which were not provided. Overall, the script itself appears safe.",
