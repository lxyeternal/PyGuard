  "sources": "Reading README.md and __version__.py files from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no network activity.",
  "flows": "Static file reads; no dynamic data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info from __version__.py, which could be risky if the file is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious payloads. The only potential concern is the use of exec() on a local file, which could execute malicious code if the file is tampered with. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The exec() pattern is common but warrants caution. The scores across reports correctly reflect no malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and a slight security risk (0.2-0.3) due to exec().",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and typical, with a minor security concern related to executing code from a local version file. No malware or malicious intent detected. The risk stems from the exec() pattern, which should be reviewed or replaced with safer alternatives to mitigate potential tampering risks.",
