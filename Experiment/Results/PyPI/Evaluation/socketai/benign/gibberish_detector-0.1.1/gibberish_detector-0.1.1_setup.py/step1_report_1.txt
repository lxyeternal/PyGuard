  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the gibberish_detector Python package, including metadata, package discovery, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description, reads version info from __version__.py, and loads package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or user input; no output or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Reads static files to set package metadata; no flow from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "The line 'VERSION = '''  # make linters happy' appears to be a placeholder; no malicious anomaly detected here.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures. It reads files to populate metadata and configures setuptools. No dynamic code execution or input handling that could be malicious. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign package configuration file.",
