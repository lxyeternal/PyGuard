  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'gibberish_detector' Python package, configuring package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, reading the version file (__version__.py).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processed or executed in a way that leads to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Reading files to obtain long description and version information; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The version variable is set to an empty string before execution, which is a common pattern and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures: reading files for package description and version, configuring package setup parameters, and defining console entry points. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are used in a manner that could lead to code injection or data leakage. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected. The code appears typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads files for package metadata and configures the package installation. No malware or security threats identified.",
