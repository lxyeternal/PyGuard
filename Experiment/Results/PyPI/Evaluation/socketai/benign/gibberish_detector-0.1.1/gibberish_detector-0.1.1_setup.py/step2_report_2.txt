  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Setup configuration, reads README.md and version file, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code execution or untrusted data handling; standard setup script.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious intent or security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup script, reads files.\n- **Analysis:** No untrusted data or dynamic code execution beyond reading files.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Identifies the use of `exec()` to load version info as a potential concern.\n- **Analysis:** The use of `exec()` on `__version__.py` is a known pattern but can be risky if the file is compromised. No malicious code detected, but the pattern warrants caution.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly flags the `exec()` as a potential security concern, assigning a risk score of 0.3. Malware score remains 0, which is appropriate since no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3.  \n**Assessment:** Reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard setup script, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No external or untrusted data, no obfuscated code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes the use of `exec()` on `__version__.py` as a minor security concern.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes that executing code from an external file can be risky if the file is tampered with. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The concern about `exec()` is valid; the risk score of 0.2 is appropriate. Malware remains 0.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n**Assessment:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malware.\n- The only concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which is a common pattern but can be risky if the version file is compromised.\n- The risk scores assigned (0.2 to 0.3) are appropriate given the potential for code execution issues.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the `exec()` usage, a small but non-zero risk score (~0.2-0.3) is justified. It should be kept at or below 0.3 unless the version file is known to be insecure.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script.\n- The only potential concern is the `exec()` call, which should be reviewed to ensure the `__version__.py` file is securely maintained and not tampered with.\n- No malware, malicious behavior, or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.2** |\n\nThis balances the benign nature of the code with the known pattern that could pose a risk if the version file is compromised.",
