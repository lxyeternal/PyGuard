  "purpose": "Setup script for the gibberish_detector Python package, primarily for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description, reads __version__.py to get version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data is processed or executed in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file, reads README content, then proceeds with setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; standard setup script with typical package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the package description and version info from files, then configures setup parameters. No user input, no data from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution beyond reading files. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The version info is read and executed in a controlled manner from a static file. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
