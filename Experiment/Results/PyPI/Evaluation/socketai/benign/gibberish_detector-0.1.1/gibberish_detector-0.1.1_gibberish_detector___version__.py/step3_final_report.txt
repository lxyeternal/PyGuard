{
  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, typically used for package or module metadata.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a simple assignment statement with no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data flows or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code is a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment: VERSION = '0.1.1'. It contains no input/output, data processing, or external calls. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version string assignment with no malicious behavior or security risks. The current scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
