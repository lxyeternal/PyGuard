  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. All reports describe a very simple code snippet: assigning a version string ('0.1.1') to a variable named VERSION. They consistently conclude that this is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Code verification:**  \n   The original code is just:\n   ```python\n   VERSION = '0.1.1'\n   ```\n   There are no additional code constructs, no input/output, no external calls, and no suspicious patterns. All reports are accurate in stating that this is a trivial, benign version declaration.\n\n3. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that there are no data flows, no anomalies, and no malicious activity.  \n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n4. **Scores review:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware = 0`, `obfuscated = 0`, and `securityRisk = 0`. These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - No report suggests any potential vulnerability or malicious intent that would warrant a higher score.\n\n6. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing external code, downloading payloads, or obfuscating code.  \n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n7. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They treat the code as a benign version string declaration.\n\n8. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is verified to be benign.  \n- No changes needed to the scores.  \n- The current scores accurately reflect the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
