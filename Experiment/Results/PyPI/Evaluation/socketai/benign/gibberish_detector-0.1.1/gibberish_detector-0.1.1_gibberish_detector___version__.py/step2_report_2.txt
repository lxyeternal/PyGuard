  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to a variable, with no input/output, data flow, or suspicious constructs. The code snippets are minimal and typical for package version declarations.\n\n2. **Presence of issues:**  \n   - The code in question is just `VERSION = '0.1.1'`. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.  \n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified in any report.\n\n3. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.  \n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n4. **Scores review:**  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.  \n   - The confidence scores are 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n5. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no malicious intent, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.  \n   - No evidence suggests any hidden malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n   - The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as harmless.  \n   - No further security concerns are warranted.\n\n7. **Overall assessment:**  \n   - The code is a standard, benign version declaration.  \n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's simplicity. No changes needed.",
