{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for file path resolution and an iterator class for generating n-grams from text data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'text' parameter in the 'get' method; reads filesystem path information via '__file__' in 'get_path_to'.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink of untrusted data; the code primarily processes data in-memory and constructs paths internally.",
  "flows": "Path resolution uses '__file__' and input 'path' to produce an absolute path; 'get' method filters text characters and yields n-grams based on a character set.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code appears to be standard utility functions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The 'get_path_to' function resolves a relative path to an absolute one based on the current script's location, which is standard practice. The 'NGramIterator' class initializes with a character set and size, then filters input text to characters in the set before generating n-grams. Both components perform benign operations without external network activity, file manipulation beyond path resolution, or suspicious behavior. There are no anomalies indicating malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward utility code without malicious intent. It performs safe path resolution and in-memory text processing. No malicious or security risks are detected.",
