{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for path resolution and an iterator class for generating n-grams from text based on a specified charset.",
  "sources": "The get_path_to function reads the __file__ variable to determine a directory path; the NGramIterator class reads its charset and text input when calling get().",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write data to external sources, send data over network, or interact with system resources beyond reading a path variable.",
  "flows": "get_path_to constructs a file path based on the script location; NGramIterator.get filters input text based on charset and yields n-grams; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code appears to serve straightforward utility purposes without hidden actions.",
  "analysis": "The get_path_to function computes a relative path based on the current file location; it does not perform any network or system modifications. The NGramIterator class generates character n-grams from input text filtered by a charset; no external calls or suspicious operations are present. The code relies solely on standard library functions, with no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. Overall, the code is simple, non-malicious utility code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for path resolution and text processing. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code snippet.",
