  "sources": "os.path functions for path resolution; text input in get method for filtering and n-gram creation.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input text -> filtered characters -> n-gram tuples yielded.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions: get_path_to constructs an absolute path based on the script's directory, and NGramIterator filters input text by a character set and yields n-grams. Both are standard, well-understood operations with no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the reports (mostly 0 or 0.1) are conservative but acceptable given the benign nature of the functions. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for path handling and text processing. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The malware score should be 0, the obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score 0, with high confidence.",
