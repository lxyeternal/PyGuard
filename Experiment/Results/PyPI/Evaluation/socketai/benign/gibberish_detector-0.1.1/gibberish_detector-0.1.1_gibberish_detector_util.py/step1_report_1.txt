{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to compute file paths relative to the current script and to generate n-grams from a filtered subset of characters in a text string.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.join, os.path.dirname, __file__, the 'path' parameter in get_path_to, and the 'text' parameter in get method.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only processes data internally without writing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Input 'path' flows through get_path_to for path resolution; 'text' flows through get method, filtered by charset, then yields n-grams.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code performs standard path manipulation and character filtering.",
  "analysis": "The get_path_to function constructs an absolute path based on the script's directory and a relative input, which is standard. The NGramIterator class initializes with a charset and n-gram size, then filters input text by charset and yields n-grams. There is no evidence of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a utility for text processing and path resolution, with no network activity, no data exfiltration, and no obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing path resolution and n-gram generation utilities without any malicious intent or security risks.",
