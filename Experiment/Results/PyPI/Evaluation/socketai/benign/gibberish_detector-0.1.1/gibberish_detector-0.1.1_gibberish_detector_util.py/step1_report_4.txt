{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for path resolution and an iterator class for generating n-grams from a given text using a specified character set.",
  "sources": "The get_path_to function reads the file system path; the NGramIterator class reads input text via its get method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly; the code only processes text and paths without transmitting data or executing commands.",
  "flows": "Input paths are used in get_path_to to generate absolute paths; text input is filtered in get() to produce n-grams based on the charset.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The get_path_to function constructs an absolute path based on the current file location and a relative path, which is standard and safe. The NGramIterator class initializes with a charset and size, then filters input text to only include characters in the charset before generating n-grams, which is a typical implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code performs basic file path manipulation and text processing without external network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for path handling and text processing. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
