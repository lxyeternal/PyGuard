  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of malicious activity, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is benign, performing standard path resolution and text filtering. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the report finds no malicious behavior, just utility functions. The securityRisk score is slightly above zero (0.1), perhaps reflecting a cautious stance, but no actual vulnerabilities are identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis confirms benign utility functions with standard operations. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues found; the report's reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis confirms benign utility functions with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware=0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation; obfuscated=0.\n- **Risk Score:** The securityRisk scores are mostly at 0.1, reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor, likely due to the generic utility nature; no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be standard utility functions for path resolution and n-gram generation, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code being benign. The scores are appropriate and justified. No adjustments needed.",
