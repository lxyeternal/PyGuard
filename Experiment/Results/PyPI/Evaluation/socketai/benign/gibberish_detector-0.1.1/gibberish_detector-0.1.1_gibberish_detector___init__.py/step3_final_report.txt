  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data points, dynamic imports, environment variables, external data sources, network calls, and code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, environment variable access, data leakage points, and system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables flow into processing functions, which may lead to sinks like network transmission or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or minimal code snippets; high confidence in benignity; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either missing or non-informative code snippets, with scores reflecting no detected malicious activity or obfuscation. Report 4 provides a detailed assessment with high confidence (0.8) and a low security risk (0.2), justified by potential dynamic features but no concrete evidence. The other reports correctly assign zero scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk, consistent with the absence of code. The scoring aligns with the evidence, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, the dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and conservative, reflecting the lack of code or suspicious activity. Overall, the dependency appears benign with minimal security concern.",
