{
  "purpose": "This code trains a model based on n-grams from a text file to detect gibberish text.",
  "sources": "Reading data from a file specified by filename parameter, reading file content within train() function.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data is used insecurely; no network, command execution, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "File data is read in train(), passed to train_on_content(), and used to train the Model object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; standard file handling and model training process.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data from a file, processes the content line-by-line to train a Model instance. No hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious control flow present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a text-based model training pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purposefully designed for text processing to detect gibberish. No malware or malicious behavior detected. Security risks are minimal, mainly related to file handling which is standard.",
