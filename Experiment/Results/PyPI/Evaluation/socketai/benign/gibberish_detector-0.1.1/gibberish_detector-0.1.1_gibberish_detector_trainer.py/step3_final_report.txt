{
  "purpose": "Train a language model based on n-grams from a text file or content, used for gibberish detection.",
  "sources": "File input via filename, reading content line-by-line.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to external systems or effects.",
  "flows": "Filename -> file reading -> content -> model training -> JSON output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, reading a specified file, processing its content line-by-line, and training a Model object. It includes no network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code. The external dependencies are assumed benign. The scoring in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) aligns with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is legitimate, and the implementation is transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code is safe for use.",
