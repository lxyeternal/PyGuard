  "purpose": "Configuration script setting directory paths and project levels for AutoAPI.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) to determine SITE_ROOT.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward path and constant definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, determines SITE_ROOT via __file__, sets TEMPLATE_DIR, and defines static constants. It does not process user input, external data, or perform dynamic execution. All functions used are standard and safe. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is a typical configuration snippet with no malicious intent or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent.",
  "confidence": 1,
