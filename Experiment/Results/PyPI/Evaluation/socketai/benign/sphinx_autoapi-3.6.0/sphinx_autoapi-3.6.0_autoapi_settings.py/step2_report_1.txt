  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward configuration script defining directory paths and constants. There are no signs of malicious code, dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data processing. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - malware: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, there is no justification for higher scores. The code is non-malicious and poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly identify no malware activity. The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not rely on assumptions; they analyze the code directly. Their conclusions are justified.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is a standard configuration script with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.\n\n**Overall Recommendation**:  \nThe code is benign; maintain the current low scores. No security risks or malicious activity are present.",
