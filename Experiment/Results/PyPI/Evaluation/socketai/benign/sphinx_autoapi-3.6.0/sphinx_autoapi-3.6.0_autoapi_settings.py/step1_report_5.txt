  "purpose": "To set basic configuration paths and parameters for AutoAPI projects.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) and os.path.join(SITE_ROOT, \"templates\") for determining directory paths.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input sources.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses standard Python functions for directory path resolution; no hardcoded credentials or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines directory paths based on the current file location and static string constants. It imports 'os' and uses 'os.path' functions to establish directory paths for site root and templates. The list 'OWN_PAGE_LEVELS' is a static list of strings. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a configuration setup with no malicious behavior or security issues. It solely establishes directory paths and constants for project settings.",
