  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data outputs or sensitive data leaks",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows or user input processing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors; standard directory setup",
  "analysis": "The code defines static configuration variables using safe standard library functions for directory paths. No user input, external data, or dynamic execution is involved. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a configuration purpose only. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply establishes directory paths and API settings for a project.",
