  "purpose": "Define basic configuration settings for AutoAPI projects, including directory paths and project structure levels.",
  "sources": "os.path.realpath(__file__), os.path.join(SITE_ROOT, \"templates\")",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code only reads environment and file paths without untrusted data manipulation",
  "flows": "None; the code only reads data and assigns constants without processing untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines SITE_ROOT based on the current file's real path, constructs a TEMPLATE_DIR path, and sets constants for API_ROOT and OWN_PAGE_LEVELS. All operations are standard for configuration scripts, with no dynamic execution or external input handling that could introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard configuration setup for an AutoAPI project, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
