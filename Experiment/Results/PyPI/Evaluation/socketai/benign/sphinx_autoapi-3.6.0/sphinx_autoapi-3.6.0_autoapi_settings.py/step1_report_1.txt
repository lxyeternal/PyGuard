  "purpose": "Set basic configuration for AutoAPI project, defining directory paths and API structure levels.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) to determine site root directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions present.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only defines constants and directory paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of simple path and list definitions with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, determines the site root directory using __file__ and realpath, and sets up directory paths and API levels as constants. There are no user inputs, no external data processing, and no network or system modifications. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks.",
