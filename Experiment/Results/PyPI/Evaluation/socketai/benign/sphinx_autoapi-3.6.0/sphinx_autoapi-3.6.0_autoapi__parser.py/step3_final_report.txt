  "purpose": "Static parser and analyzer for Python source files, extracting documentation, class, function, and attribute information for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads source files, AST nodes, and sibling nodes for docstrings and annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads data and constructs internal data structures without external effects.",
  "flows": "Source files and AST nodes are read; data flows into internal structures for documentation extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; straightforward static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of Python source files using astroid, extracting class, function, attribute, and type alias information. It does not execute code, connect to networks, or modify files. The logic is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior. The code's operation is limited to reading and analyzing source code, which is inherently safe. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward static analysis utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
