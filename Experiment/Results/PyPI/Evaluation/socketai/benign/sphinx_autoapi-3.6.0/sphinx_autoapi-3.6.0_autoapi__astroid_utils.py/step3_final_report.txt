{
  "purpose": "The code provides static analysis utilities for inspecting Python AST nodes, resolving import paths, extracting annotations, and analyzing class/function properties.",
  "sources": "Functions read from AST nodes such as import statements, class and function definitions, annotations, and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or external system interactions; the code only processes AST nodes for static analysis purposes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source points like import nodes, function/class nodes, and constants through resolution and inference functions, but do not lead to any external or malicious effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and read-only.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for static code analysis, including name resolution, annotation formatting, and property checks. It does not perform any dynamic execution, network communication, or system modification. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are detected. The functions operate solely on AST nodes to extract metadata, which is typical for static analysis tools. Given this, there is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect a safe, non-malicious nature, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) to account for potential misuse in a malicious context, but overall it is safe.",
