  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is for static analysis, inspecting AST nodes, resolving names, imports, annotations, and class/function properties.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external effects; functions operate on AST nodes without executing code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. It’s a read-only utility.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, benign, with high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscation scores are zero.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static analysis functions, resolving import paths, class hierarchies, annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling; processes AST nodes for static info.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. Functions are typical for static analysis.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, low security risk, high confidence (0.95). Malware score is zero.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for static analysis—resolving names, decorators, class properties.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flows; operates on AST nodes for metadata.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, code injection, or external communication.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, typical static analysis code, high confidence (0.9). Malware score zero.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static analysis focus—resolving import names, annotations, class structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external effects; purely introspective.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, low security risk, high confidence (0.95). Malware score zero.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for static analysis, resolving code metadata.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or harmful data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, low risk, high confidence (0.9). Malware score zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate zero. The code is purely static analysis, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero in all reports; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, the risk score should be very low, around 0.0 to 0.1.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code performs static analysis on Python AST nodes—resolving names, annotations, import paths, and class properties.\n- It does not execute untrusted code, perform network or file operations, or handle sensitive data.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The functions are typical for code quality, linting, or static analysis tools, which are inherently safe.\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily because static analysis tools could be misused if combined with malicious inputs, but on their own, they are safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign static analysis utility, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for supply chain inclusion, assuming no malicious modifications are introduced later.",
