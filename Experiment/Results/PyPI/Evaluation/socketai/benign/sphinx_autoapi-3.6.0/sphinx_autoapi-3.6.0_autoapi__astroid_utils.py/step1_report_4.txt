{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for static analysis of Python code, focusing on resolving import names, analyzing class and function definitions, and extracting metadata such as annotations, docstrings, and inheritance structures.",
  "sources": "It reads input from AST nodes representing imports, class and function definitions, assignments, annotations, and other code structures.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the code mainly performs static analysis and string manipulation without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve resolving names from import statements to fully qualified names, analyzing class hierarchies, and extracting constant values and annotations from AST nodes; there are no untrusted data flows or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or code that performs suspicious actions such as network access, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code relies solely on static analysis of Python AST nodes.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a collection of utility functions designed for static code analysis. It uses the astroid library to parse and analyze Python AST nodes, resolving names, annotations, and class structures. There are no operations that involve executing code, handling untrusted input, or communicating over networks. The functions are focused on code introspection, which is typical for linters, type checkers, or security analyzers. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static analysis utility with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is intended for analyzing Python code structure and metadata. The overall security risk score is low.",
