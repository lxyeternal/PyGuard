{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for analyzing and resolving Python code structures, including import resolution, class and function analysis, annotations, and assignments, likely for static analysis or code quality tools.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include AST nodes (astroid.nodes.*) representing Python code structure, such as imports, assignments, functions, classes, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not perform data output or sensitive data handling directly. It primarily processes AST nodes.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve AST nodes being analyzed and resolved through functions like resolve_import_alias, get_full_import_name, resolve_qualname, etc., but no untrusted data flows to external systems or effects are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a comprehensive static analysis utility with no suspicious or malicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is well-structured for static analysis tasks, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis tasks such as resolving import aliases, full import paths, qualified names, constant values, annotations, and class/method properties. All functions operate on AST nodes and perform safe, predictable transformations or lookups. There are no network calls, file I/O, or system modifications. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are found. The functions are typical for a static code analysis toolkit, focusing on code structure and metadata extraction. No hardcoded secrets, data exfiltration, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign static analysis utility focused on Python AST manipulation. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware signatures. Its purpose appears to be safe and intended for code introspection. The overall security risk is minimal, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
