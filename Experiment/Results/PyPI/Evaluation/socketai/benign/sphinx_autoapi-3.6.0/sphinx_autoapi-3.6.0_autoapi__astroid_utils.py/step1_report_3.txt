{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for static analysis of Python code, such as resolving import names, analyzing function annotations, class hierarchies, and decorators, primarily for code introspection or linting tools.",
  "sources": "Import statements; class and function definitions; attribute accesses; method calls; variable assignments; decorators; string manipulations; node lookups in AST structures.",
  "sinks": "Inferencing methods (e.g., node.infer()); attribute and method accesses that could execute code indirectly; string manipulations that resolve or format code elements.",
  "flows": "Input nodes (e.g., AST nodes) are processed through various functions to resolve names, annotations, and class hierarchies, with potential inference calls and string processing to produce fully qualified names or annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious API keys; no evident backdoors or code that communicates externally; no dynamic code execution or network activity; no obfuscated code. Usage of inference and AST resolution functions appears to be for static analysis purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous helper functions for static analysis tasks, including resolving import aliases, fully qualifying names, extracting constant values, analyzing function decorators, and inspecting class properties such as whether a class is an exception or an abstract class. There are no code paths that perform network operations, execute system commands, or access sensitive data. All functions operate on AST nodes and are designed for code introspection. The usage of inference methods and string resolution functions is typical for static analysis tools, not for malicious purposes. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are present. The code appears to be a legitimate static analysis utility module intended for code quality or security auditing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static analysis utility for Python AST manipulation, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions to resolve names, annotations, decorators, and class properties, which are typical tasks in code quality tools. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware embedded in the logic.",
