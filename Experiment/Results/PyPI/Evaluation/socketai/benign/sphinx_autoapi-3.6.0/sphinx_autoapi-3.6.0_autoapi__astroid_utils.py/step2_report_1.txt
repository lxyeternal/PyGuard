  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for static analysis of Python AST nodes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious data flows; functions process AST nodes for code analysis.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious logic, no obfuscation, no external system interaction.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign static analysis utilities, safe, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a set of static analysis tools with no malicious intent. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately 0, and the security risk is negligible. The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static analysis functions for Python code structure.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or sensitive data handling; purely AST processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe, intended for code quality or security auditing.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose. Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, with a very high confidence (0.95). The security risk is minimal (0.1), possibly due to the nature of static analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for static analysis, resolving names, annotations, class properties.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious data flows; functions analyze AST nodes.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious patterns; typical static analysis code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, safe, low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly notes the benign nature. Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, confidence high (0.9), security risk negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static analysis of Python code, resolving imports, class/function analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or execution; only code introspection.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, confidence very high (0.95).\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for static analysis, extracting metadata.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No harmful data flows; only string and AST node processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external system interaction.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign static analysis utility, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is minimal (0.1), confidence high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a collection of static analysis utilities operating on AST nodes.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as no external communication, code execution, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Confidence:** Ranges from 0.9 to 0.95, reflecting high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, considering the potential for misuse in a malicious context, but overall benign)\n\n**Justification:** The code is purely static analysis, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or harmful behavior. The high confidence and low risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a safe, well-structured static analysis utility for Python AST nodes, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
