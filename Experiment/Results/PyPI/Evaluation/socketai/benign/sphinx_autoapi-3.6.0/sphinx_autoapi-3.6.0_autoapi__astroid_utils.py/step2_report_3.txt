  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Obfuscated Code**:  \n   All reports consistently state that the code is a static analysis utility operating on AST nodes, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data flows. The code performs name resolution, annotation formatting, and class/function property checks, which are typical for code analysis tools.\n\n2. **Functionality and Purpose**:  \n   The code's purpose is to analyze Python code structure, resolve import paths, extract annotations, and identify class/function properties. It uses the `astroid` library for static code inspection. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network access, or file manipulation that could be exploited maliciously.\n\n3. **Security and Malware Scores**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious logic. The overall security risk is minimal, with scores around 0.0 to 0.1, indicating no significant vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential for Misuse**:  \n   While the functions involve inference and name resolution, these are standard in static analysis tools. They could theoretically be misused if combined with untrusted inputs, but on their own, they pose no security threat.\n\n5. **Obfuscation and Anomalies**:  \n   No obfuscated code or anomalies suggesting malicious intent are observed. The code is well-structured and clear in its purpose.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The assigned scores seem reasonable given the analysis. The malware score of 0 is appropriate, and the risk scores are low, matching the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (very low, given it's static analysis code)\n\n**My Own Estimation**:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign static analysis utility with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation.  \n- Functions operate solely on AST nodes for code inspection.  \n- No external system interactions, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms.  \n- The purpose aligns with static analysis, not malicious activity.\n\n**Overall conclusion**: The code is safe, well-structured, and intended for static code analysis. The assigned scores are appropriate, and I see no reason to adjust them.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (consistent with the low security risk)",
