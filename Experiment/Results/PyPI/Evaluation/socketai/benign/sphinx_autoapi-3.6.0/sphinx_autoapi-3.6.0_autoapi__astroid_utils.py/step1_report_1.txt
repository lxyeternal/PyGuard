{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for analyzing Python AST nodes, resolving names, import paths, annotations, and class/function properties, likely used in static code analysis or linting tools.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from AST nodes, import statements, class/function definitions, and code annotations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted input is inferred and misused, but no explicit sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from AST nodes (sources) through various resolution and inference functions, but there are no evident malicious data flows leading to harmful sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are observed. The code mainly performs static analysis tasks. No unusual dynamic execution, network operations, or file manipulations are present. The presence of inference and name resolution could potentially be misused if combined with malicious inputs, but the functions themselves are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive set of static analysis utilities focused on resolving import paths, variable names, class and function properties, and annotations in Python ASTs. It handles name resolution, annotation formatting, and detection of special function decorators such as property and overload. No network, file, or system commands are invoked. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors. The functions operate on AST nodes purely for analysis purposes, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of static analysis utilities with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is intended for safe, read-only analysis of Python code structure. No indicators of malware, sabotage, or supply chain attacks are present.",
