  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, straightforward Python module for a package, importing a setup function and defining version info. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data handling. The code is benign and typical for such modules.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of data flows, external inputs, or suspicious patterns. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the benign nature.  \n   - **Security risk score:** 0 in all reports, justified by the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports assign a score of 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is straightforward, there's no need to adjust these scores upward.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network calls, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and based on concrete code analysis, not assumptions. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard package module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. It merely imports a setup function and defines version info, with no external data handling or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.",
