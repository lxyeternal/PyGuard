  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.extension import setup).",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data being sent externally or untrusted data usage.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only sets module attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a setup function from a local module, defines module exports and version info. It is a straightforward module initialization script with no external data input or output, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious activity or obfuscation detected. The structure and content are typical for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only to expose a setup function and version information for the package. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
