{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a minimal setup module for a Sphinx extension, importing a setup function and defining version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a local module and defines static variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leakage or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not handle data streams or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module that imports a setup function, defines version info, and exposes setup via __all__. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is typical for a package initialization script and poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. All signals indicate a safe, standard package module. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores set to 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
