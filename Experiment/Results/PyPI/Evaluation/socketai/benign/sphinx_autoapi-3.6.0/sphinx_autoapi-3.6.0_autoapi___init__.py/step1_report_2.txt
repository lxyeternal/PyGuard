  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple package module defining setup functions and version information for the Sphinx AutoAPI extension.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.extension), version variables (__version__, __version_info__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external data outputs",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from sources to sinks; only importing a setup function and defining version info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, minimal, and contains no suspicious patterns or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a setup function from a local module, defines version metadata, and exposes the setup function in __all__. There are no signs of data processing, input handling, or malicious activity. The code is typical for a Python package module, with no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple package interface with version info. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
