{
  "purpose": "The code is a module that imports a setup function from a local extension and exposes it, likely as part of a package's API.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module attributes (__version__, __version_info__) and the imported setup function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code does not process input data; it merely defines module attributes and exports a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. The version information is static but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a setup function from a relative module, defines module-level attributes for versioning, and exposes the setup function via __all__. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could be exploited. The code appears to be a standard module setup snippet with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package initialization snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
