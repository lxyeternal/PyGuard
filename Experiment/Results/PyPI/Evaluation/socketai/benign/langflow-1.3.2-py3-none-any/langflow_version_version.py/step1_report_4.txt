  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve package version information and determine if a version is a pre-release.",
  "sources": "Reads package names from a list and attempts to get their versions using metadata.version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to potential vulnerabilities; primarily reads package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads package version data from package metadata for each listed package name.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, retrieves package versions via importlib.metadata, and checks version strings for pre-release labels. The version retrieval process suppresses exceptions safely. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved. No suspicious code patterns or malicious behavior are detected. The code functions as a utility for version info and pre-release checking, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, focusing solely on package version retrieval and analysis. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It is a straightforward utility module.",
