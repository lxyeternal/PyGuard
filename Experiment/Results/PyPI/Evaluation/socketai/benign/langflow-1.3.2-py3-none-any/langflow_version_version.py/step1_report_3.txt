{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to retrieve the version of specified Python packages and to determine if a version string indicates a pre-release.",
  "sources": "The code reads package names from a predefined list and attempts to get their versions using metadata.version(). It does not read untrusted input from external sources.",
  "sinks": "The only potential sink is the raising of a ValueError if no package version is found, which is standard exception handling and not malicious.",
  "flows": "The code flows from iterating over package names to attempting to retrieve versions, then possibly raising an error if no version is found. The is_pre_release function analyzes version strings for specific labels.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs straightforward package metadata queries and simple string checks without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code safely queries package versions using importlib.metadata, handling errors with contextlib.suppress to avoid crashes. It does not use untrusted input, execute external commands, or handle sensitive data. The is_pre_release function simply checks for common pre-release labels. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for package versioning and pre-release detection with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
