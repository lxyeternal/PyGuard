  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of specified packages and determine if the version is a pre-release.",
  "sources": "The package names list and the metadata.version() function call to get package versions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only reads package metadata and performs string checks.",
  "flows": "The code iterates over package names, retrieves their versions, and checks for pre-release labels within the version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard library functions and handles missing packages gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that retrieves package versions from a predefined list using importlib.metadata, handling missing packages with contextlib.suppress. It then checks if the version string contains pre-release labels ('a', 'b', 'rc') to identify pre-release versions. No external inputs, network operations, or untrusted data handling are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or security-sensitive operations. The logic is clear, standard, and safe. No signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for package version retrieval and pre-release detection. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and is implemented using standard, safe practices. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero.",
