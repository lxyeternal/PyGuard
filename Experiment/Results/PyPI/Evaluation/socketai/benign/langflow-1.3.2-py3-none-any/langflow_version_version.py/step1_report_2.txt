{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions to retrieve the version of specific packages and determine if a version is a pre-release.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from package metadata via importlib.metadata.version and hardcoded package name list.",
  "sinks": "The only potential sink is raising a ValueError if no package version is found, which is standard error handling.",
  "flows": "The code fetches package versions based on package names; if none found, raises an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code uses standard library functions for safe metadata access.",
  "analysis": "The code uses safe standard library functions to retrieve package versions without executing external code or handling untrusted input. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are observed. The package list is hardcoded but not malicious. Error handling is typical, and no data leaks or system manipulations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard utility for package version retrieval and pre-release detection, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
