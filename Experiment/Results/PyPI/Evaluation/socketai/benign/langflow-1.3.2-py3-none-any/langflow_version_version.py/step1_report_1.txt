{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the version of specific packages and checks if the version is a pre-release.",
  "sources": "The code reads package names from a predefined list and attempts to retrieve their versions using importlib.metadata.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that could lead to data leakage or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code flows from iterating over package names to obtaining their versions and then to checking if a version string indicates a pre-release.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are present. The code relies on standard library functions and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package metadata retrieval and version string analysis. It uses contextlib.suppress to handle missing packages safely. The is_pre_release function checks for common pre-release labels within a version string. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior. No external or untrusted data sources are involved, and no dangerous operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for package version management and pre-release detection. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
