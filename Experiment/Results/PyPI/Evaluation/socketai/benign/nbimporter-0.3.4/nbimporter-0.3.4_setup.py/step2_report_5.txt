  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Assessment**: Correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no suspicious behaviors.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)\n     - Risk: 0 (benign configuration)\n   - **Justification**: The code is standard, static, and free of any malicious indicators. The high confidence (1) is appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Assessment**: Also correctly notes that the script is a static configuration with no external data or suspicious code.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Risk: 0\n   - **Justification**: No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. The script is typical for package setup.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Assessment**: Same as above; the script is a standard setup file.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Risk: 0\n   - **Justification**: No issues identified; the script is benign.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Assessment**: Correctly states that the code is a standard package setup script.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Risk: 0\n   - **Justification**: No malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Assessment**: Also consistent; no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Risk: 0\n   - **Justification**: All observations point to a benign setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence of issues**: None. All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports**: None detected.\n- **Score consistency**: All scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Malware and obfuscation**: Correctly scored as zero.\n- **Risk score**: Correctly zero, as there are no security concerns.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.",
