  "purpose": "To define and configure the packaging setup for the 'nbimporter' Python module.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input or external data reading beyond setup configuration).",
  "targets": "N/A (no untrusted data sinks, no data leaks or system modification).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from source to sink, as the script only defines package metadata).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed; the script is a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata such as name, version, description, author, contact, modules, license, URL, and build requirements. It is a typical setup.py file for packaging a Python module, with no code execution, input reading, or external data manipulation. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script for 'nbimporter'. It contains no malicious code or security risks. The code appears benign and solely intended for packaging purposes.",
