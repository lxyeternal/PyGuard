  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration",
  "flows": "N/A - static data, no data flow or external input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static setup script",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools, with all data hardcoded and no dynamic or external inputs. It contains no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the static, well-structured code. No code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present, indicating no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain unchanged.",
