  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'nbimporter' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools module, reading static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard setup script without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and calls it with static package metadata such as name, version, description, author details, license, URL, and build requirements. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no code execution, and no suspicious code behaviors. The structure is straightforward and conforms to common Python packaging practices. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks.",
