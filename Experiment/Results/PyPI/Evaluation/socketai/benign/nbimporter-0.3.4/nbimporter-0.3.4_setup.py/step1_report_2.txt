  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging the 'nbimporter' Python module.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are read; static setup parameters are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations that process untrusted data; primarily package metadata and configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; configuration is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls 'setup()' with static parameters describing package metadata. All data is hardcoded, standard for Python package setup scripts, with no user input or dynamic code execution. There are no suspicious or malicious operations, and the script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely provides package metadata and configuration without any malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
