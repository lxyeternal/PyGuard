{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to display a summarized view of a Jupyter notebook's contents, highlighting code cells and displaying text cells as plain preformatted text.",
  "sources": "The code reads a filename parameter in the show_notebook function, which is provided as an argument when called.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data to external systems; it only reads a local file and renders HTML for display.",
  "flows": "Input: filename parameter -> Reads notebook file -> Parses JSON content -> Extracts cells -> Renders highlighted code or plain text -> Displays in notebook environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors detected; use of display and HTML rendering is standard for Jupyter notebook visualization. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports libraries for reading notebook files (nbformat), syntax highlighting (pygments), and display (IPython.display). It defines a function to load and parse a notebook file, then generates HTML to display each cell with syntax highlighting for code cells and plain text for others. The only file input is specified by a filename parameter, with no external network activity or data exfiltration. The code's purpose appears strictly related to visualization within a Jupyter notebook environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for notebook visualization with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious actions or data leaks.",
