  "purpose": "A utility to display Jupyter notebook contents with syntax highlighting within a Jupyter environment.",
  "sources": "Reads a notebook file from disk using io.open and nbformat.read; processes each cell's source code or text.",
  "sinks": "Displays HTML output via IPython.display; no untrusted data sinks or external network activity present.",
  "flows": "Reads notebook file -> processes cells -> generates HTML with syntax highlighting -> displays within environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O, uses well-known libraries (nbformat, pygments, IPython.display) for visualization. It does not execute or evaluate untrusted code, connect to networks, or handle sensitive data. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate given the benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for displaying notebook content with syntax highlighting. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The high overall risk scores in the reports are overstated; a risk score around 0.1 accurately reflects the minimal security concern.",
