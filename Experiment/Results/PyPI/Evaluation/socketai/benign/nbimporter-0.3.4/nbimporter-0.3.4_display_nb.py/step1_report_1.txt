  "purpose": "The code is designed to display a summary of Jupyter notebook contents by rendering the code and markdown cells with syntax highlighting for web presentation.",
  "sources": "Reads notebook files from disk using io.open and nbformat.read, accesses cell contents via nb.cells.",
  "sinks": "Outputs HTML to display in a Jupyter environment, rendering notebook cell contents with syntax highlighting.",
  "flows": "Reads notebook file -> processes cells -> generates HTML for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation. Usage of display functions is standard for Jupyter environments.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules for reading notebook files, syntax highlighting, and HTML display. It defines a function to read a specified notebook file, parse its cells, and generate HTML with syntax highlighting for code cells and plain text for markdown cells. The display of CSS styles and notebook content is handled via IPython.display. The example usage is commented out. No external network access or sensitive data handling is evident. The code performs file I/O, content processing, and display logic consistent with standard notebook visualization tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for visualizing notebook contents with syntax highlighting. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
