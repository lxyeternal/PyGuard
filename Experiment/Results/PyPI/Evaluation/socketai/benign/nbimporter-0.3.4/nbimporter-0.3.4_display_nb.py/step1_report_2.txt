{
  "purpose": "To display a summary of notebook cells with syntax highlighting in an IPython environment.",
  "sources": "Reading notebook file with io.open and nbformat.read; accessing environment variables and IPython display functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no output to untrusted sources or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "User provides a filename to show_notebook; the file is read and processed; output is displayed within the IPython environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for reading and displaying Jupyter notebooks with syntax highlighting. It defines a function to read a specified notebook file, parse its content, and display each cell with formatting. The use of io.open with a specified encoding is safe, and the display functions are standard IPython tools. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data exfiltration methods are present. The code appears to be benign and intended solely for notebook visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for displaying notebook content with syntax highlighting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
