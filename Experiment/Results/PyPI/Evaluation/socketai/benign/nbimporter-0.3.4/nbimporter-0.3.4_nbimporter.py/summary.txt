  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate utility for importing notebooks as modules but inherently executes arbitrary code without sanitization, posing significant security risks when handling untrusted notebooks. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation itself, but its design allows for execution of potentially malicious payloads embedded in notebooks. The malware score should be low but non-zero due to this risk, and the security risk score should be high. A balanced assessment assigns a malware score of approximately 0.2 and a security risk score of about 0.8, reflecting the inherent danger of executing untrusted code without safeguards."
