{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to combine and modify docstrings of functions by parsing and merging docstring metadata from multiple sources.",
  "sources": "Reads function __doc__ attribute, input functions' __doc__ attributes, and uses imported parse functions.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the __doc__ attribute of the decorated function.",
  "flows": "Reads input __doc__ strings -> parses docstrings -> merges metadata -> updates function __doc__ with composed result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; no network activity or file operations; logic appears straightforward for docstring manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules and local parsing utilities. It defines a decorator 'combine_docstrings' which parses the docstrings from provided functions and the decorated function itself, then combines their metadata based on specified rules, excluding certain metadata types if specified. It updates the decorated function's __doc__ attribute with the composed docstring generated via 'compose'. The implementation relies entirely on safe, read-only operations on function docstrings and standard library modules, with no external data transmission or malicious payloads observed. No code injection, data leakage, or harmful operations are present. The code's purpose is documentation enhancement, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for combining docstrings in Python. It involves no malicious behavior or security risks. The operations are confined to parsing and updating docstrings, which are safe. No suspicious activity detected.",
