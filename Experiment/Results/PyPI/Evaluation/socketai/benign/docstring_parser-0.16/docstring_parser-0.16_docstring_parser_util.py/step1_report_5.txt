  "purpose": "Utility functions for working with docstrings, specifically combining multiple docstrings into a single, unified docstring for a function.",
  "sources": "Reads the function's own __doc__ attribute and the __doc__ attributes of other functions passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "Assigns a new value to the function's __doc__ attribute after composing it from parsed docstrings.",
  "flows": "Parses docstrings from input functions -> merges and processes parsed data -> assigns composed docstring back to the decorated function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code relies on parsing and composing docstrings and does not execute untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and internal modules to parse, compose, and manage docstrings. It defines a decorator that combines docstrings from multiple functions, selectively excludes certain metadata types, and modifies the decorated function's __doc__ attribute with the composed result. The process involves parsing docstrings, merging descriptions, and concatenating metadata, all within a controlled framework. No code injection, network operations, or system modifications are present. The only potential concern is the use of __doc__ attribute modification, which is benign in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility for managing docstrings, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs structured parsing and merging of docstrings without executing or transmitting data. There are no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities in this implementation.",
