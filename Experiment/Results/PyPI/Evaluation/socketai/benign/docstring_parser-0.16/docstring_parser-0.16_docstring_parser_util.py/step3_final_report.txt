  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing, combining, and modifying Python function docstrings to facilitate documentation management.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function __doc__ attributes, external parse() calls, and function signatures via inspect.Signature.",
  "sinks": "Assigns modified docstring back to function __doc__ attribute after composition.",
  "flows": "parse() extracts docstrings -> modifications are made to parsed data -> compose() generates new docstring -> assigned to function.__doc__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; operations are read-only or string manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for managing function docstrings, involving parsing, merging metadata, and replacing __doc__. It relies on external modules for parsing and composing docstrings, with no network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. It manipulates the __doc__ attribute safely, and the logic is clear and well-structured. No anomalies or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, documentation utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe string and metadata operations, and all evidence supports a non-malicious, straightforward purpose.",
