  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing, combining, and modifying Python function docstrings programmatically.",
  "sources": "Reads the __doc__ attribute of functions and classes, and input parameters such as others, exclude, style, and rendering_style.",
  "sinks": "Assigns to the __doc__ attribute of functions, uses compose() to generate new docstrings, and processes metadata from parsed docstrings.",
  "flows": "Input: function __doc__ and other functions' __doc__ -> parse() for each -> combine docstring metadata -> compose() -> assign to function.__doc__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network calls, file operations, or other suspicious behavior. The code manipulates docstrings and metadata only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator to combine multiple docstrings into a single docstring for a function, based on parsing and merging logic. It uses functions like parse() and compose() from external modules to process docstrings, and ChainMap to merge parameter dictionaries. The logic is purely focused on string processing and metadata management. No network activity, file I/O, or system commands are present. There are no indications of malicious payloads or backdoors. All operations are related to docstring handling and do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing function docstrings, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs string and metadata manipulation in a controlled manner, without external communication or harmful actions.",
