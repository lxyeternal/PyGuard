  "purpose": "Utility functions for working with and combining Python function docstrings, specifically providing a decorator to programmatically merge multiple docstrings.",
  "sources": "Reads the decorated function's __doc__ attribute, and the __doc__ attributes of other functions passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses the parse and compose functions to process docstrings, then assigns the result back to the decorated function's __doc__ attribute.",
  "flows": "Collects docstrings from input functions, parses them, combines metadata, and updates the decorated function's __doc__ with the composed result.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors observed. Uses standard library and predictable patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'combine_docstrings' that merges docstrings from multiple functions, prioritizes descriptions, and filters metadata based on exclusion list. It uses 'parse' and 'compose' functions for docstring processing, with safe handling of function signatures and parameters. No dynamic execution, external network access, or insecure handling detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for docstring management with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It leverages standard Python features and clear logic, focusing solely on docstring parsing and composition.",
