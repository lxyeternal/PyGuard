  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing, combining, and managing Python docstrings in a decorator-based approach.",
  "sources": "Reads function __doc__ strings, function signatures, and metadata from imported modules (.common and .parser).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is sent over networks, written to files, or executed as code.",
  "flows": "Parses docstrings, combines metadata, and assigns the composed docstring back to the decorated function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for docstring manipulation involving parsing, merging, and decorating functions. It imports necessary modules, defines a decorator that parses and combines docstrings from multiple sources based on a specified style, and replaces the target function's docstring with the composed result. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is well-structured, with clear handling of metadata, and follows standard Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for docstring management, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed solely for documentation purposes within a codebase.",
