  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a module setup, importing components and defining `__all__`. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code content. No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a standard module export setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a typical import/export setup, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: benign module setup, no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes the code as straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's nature—importing symbols and defining `__all__`—this is expected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely for module setup without handling untrusted data, network, or system commands, the risk score remains at 0.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard module initialization pattern, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- All reports correctly assess the situation.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments or concerns are necessary.",
