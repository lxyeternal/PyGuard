{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define imports and module exports for a Python package related to parsing docstrings following Sphinx notation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from its own module files (.common, .parser, .util) during import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data; the code does not process external input or user data.",
  "flows": "The code imports internal components and then exposes selected functions and classes via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing internal modules and re-exporting symbols for external use. There are no network operations, data processing, or untrusted data handling. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module file, focusing on organizing exports. No anomalies, obfuscated patterns, or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python package related to docstring parsing. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided fragment.",
