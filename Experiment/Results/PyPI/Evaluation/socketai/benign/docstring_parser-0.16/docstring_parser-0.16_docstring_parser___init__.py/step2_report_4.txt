  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content Overview**:\n   - The code imports various classes and functions from local modules (.common, .parser, .util).\n   - It defines a style alias `Style = DocstringStyle` for backward compatibility.\n   - It specifies the `__all__` list to declare the public API of the module.\n   - The code is purely organizational, setting up module exports and imports.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior Assessment**:\n   - The code performs no input/output operations, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - It does not handle untrusted data, user input, or secrets.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n   - The code functions as a typical module setup or `__init__.py` for a package.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports**:\n   - All five reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of suspicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows involving untrusted sources, no external effects, and no malicious intent.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and the malware and security risk scores are zero.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified because the code is a simple module setup with no security implications.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n   - The consistent assessment across reports supports the conclusion that the code is benign.\n\n6. **Final Assessment**:\n   - Based on the code and reports, the overall security posture is safe.\n   - No changes to scores are necessary.\n   - The code does not present any security risk or malware threat.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, benign module setup with no security concerns.",
