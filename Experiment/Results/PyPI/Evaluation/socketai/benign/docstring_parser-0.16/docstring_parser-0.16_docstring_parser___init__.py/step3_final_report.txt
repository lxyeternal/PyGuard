{
  "purpose": "Module setup for a docstring parsing library, importing classes and functions, defining style alias, and setting public API exports.",
  "sources": "Static imports from local modules (.common, .parser, .util); no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static import/export structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module initialization with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module initialization script, importing specific components, defining an alias, and setting __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, input handling, or system commands. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or write files. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of zero. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
