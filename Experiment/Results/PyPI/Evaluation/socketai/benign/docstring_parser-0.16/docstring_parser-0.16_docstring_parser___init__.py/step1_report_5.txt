{
  "purpose": "This source code defines module imports and exports related to parsing and handling docstrings, particularly for Sphinx notation, and provides backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and classes from local relative packages (.common, .parser, .util), which are used internally and for exporting functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or user input; no network operations, file writes, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and then re-exports selected components, establishing internal dependencies but not involving data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; the code follows standard Python module organization patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and the definition of the __all__ list for module exports. It sets a style alias for backward compatibility and does not include any runtime execution, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation techniques are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for a documentation parsing library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
