  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a set of class definitions, enums, and constants used for parsing and representing Python docstrings.\n- No external input handling, no network or system interactions, no dynamic code execution.\n- All data is static or passed as parameters; no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- The code appears to be a utility library for documentation parsing.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- Obfuscated scores are also 0, which aligns with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n**Risk Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n**Logic and reasoning:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely data structures and constants with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- They do not assume or infer vulnerabilities or malicious intent where none exists.\n- The analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n\n- The reports are uniform and conservative, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary in their scores or reasoning.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured utility for docstring parsing with no signs of malicious activity. The reports' scores and reasoning are appropriate and consistent.",
