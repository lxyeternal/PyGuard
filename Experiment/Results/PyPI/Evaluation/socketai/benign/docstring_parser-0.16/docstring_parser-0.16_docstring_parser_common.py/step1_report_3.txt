{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of classes and constants for parsing and representing Python docstrings, including extracting parameters, return information, exceptions, deprecation notes, and examples.",
  "sources": "Constants defining keywords; class constructors and properties that process internal data; class attributes and methods for managing docstring metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted input; the code primarily defines data structures and constants without executing untrusted code or handling external data sources.",
  "flows": "The code initializes objects with data, processes internal attributes for metadata extraction, and returns structured representations of docstring components. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward, mainly defining enums and data classes for docstring parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums for docstring styles and rendering styles, and classes to store and access parsed docstring metadata such as parameters, return values, exceptions, deprecations, and examples. It contains only data structures and simple property methods. There are no external inputs, no data processing from untrusted sources, and no dynamic execution. The code appears to be a utility library for parsing docstrings with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for docstring parsing and representation, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It does not handle external data sources or execute code dynamically. Therefore, it is safe from a security standpoint.",
