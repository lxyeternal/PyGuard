  "purpose": "This code provides classes and constants for parsing and representing docstrings in Python, supporting various styles and extracting metadata such as parameters, return info, exceptions, deprecations, and examples.",
  "sources": "The code reads from hardcoded string sets (e.g., PARAM_KEYWORDS, RAISES_KEYWORDS), class initializers, and properties within the module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or data from external sources; it primarily operates on static strings and data structures for documentation parsing.",
  "flows": "The flow involves initializing data structures with static data and using class methods and properties to organize docstring metadata, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums, constants, and classes for handling docstring metadata, such as parameters, return types, exceptions, deprecations, and examples. All data are statically defined or passed as parameters; there are no external input sources or external data manipulation. No runtime data processing from untrusted sources is present. The code appears to be a typical documentation parsing utility without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for parsing and representing docstrings, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It operates solely on static data structures and class instances without external inputs or network activity. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is negligible.",
