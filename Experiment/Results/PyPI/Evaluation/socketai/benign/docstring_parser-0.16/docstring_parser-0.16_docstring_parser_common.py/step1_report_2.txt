{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and constants for parsing and representing Python docstrings with various styles and metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements, constant keyword sets, class constructors, property methods, and enum definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; code does not handle external untrusted input or perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class constructors and property methods that process internal attributes; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. No obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to parsing and representing docstring metadata in Python. It uses enums and classes to organize style and metadata information. There are no external input handling, network operations, or code execution features. All functions and class methods operate solely on internal data and constants. The presence of well-defined data models and constants indicates straightforward, benign code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign implementation for parsing and representing Python docstrings, with no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It does not interact with external systems or perform harmful operations.",
