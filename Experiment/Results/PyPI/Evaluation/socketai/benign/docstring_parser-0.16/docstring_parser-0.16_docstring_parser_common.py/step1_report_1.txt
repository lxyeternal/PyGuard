  "purpose": "This code provides classes and constants for parsing and representing Python docstrings in various formats.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines static data and class methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. No network or system interactions present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums and classes for handling docstring parsing metadata, including parameter, return, exception, deprecation, and example information. All classes are straightforward data containers with no dynamic execution, code injection, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code appears to be standard utility code for documentation parsing with no embedded malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of data structures for docstring parsing, with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
