  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions, constants, enums, and data structures for handling docstring metadata.\n- No external data processing, network operations, code execution, or untrusted input handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate documentation parsing and representation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n- The code does not contain any external input handling, dynamic code execution, or network activity.\n- The constants and class structures are static and serve documentation purposes only.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- Security risk: All assign 0, aligning with the absence of external data handling or vulnerabilities.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No issues with the logic, reasoning, or scoring.\n- No need to adjust scores; they are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The code is a benign, utility data structure implementation for docstring parsing.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence level is high (1), as all evidence points to safe, non-malicious code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Security risk score: **0**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed. The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and carries no security risks.",
