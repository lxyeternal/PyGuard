  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and assess their findings, scores, and potential issues.\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a benign, straightforward implementation of data structures and constants for parsing Python docstrings.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- Malware scores are all 0, and security risks are also 0.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step review:\n\n**1. Confirm if issues are present in the code:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and purely defines enums, constants, and data classes.\n- No issues such as code injection, malicious logic, or vulnerabilities are observed.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n- No errors or flaws are apparent in the reports. They correctly identify the code as utility/data structure definitions without malicious intent.\n\n**3. Scores given to each issue:**\n- Malware scores are all 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- Security risks are also 0, consistent with the code's functionality.\n- The reports' scores align well with the analysis.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- No issues with high risk scores. All are 0, matching the benign assessment.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The code contains no suspicious or malicious code, so malware should be 0.\n- The reports reflect this correctly.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Given the thorough analysis, the code's purpose, and the reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of classes and constants for documentation parsing.\n- No external or dynamic behaviors that could pose security threats.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, and the scores should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0**",
