{
  "purpose": "The code defines enums, constants, and data classes for parsing and representing Python docstrings, facilitating documentation analysis.",
  "sources": "Constants defining keyword sets; class constructors initializing metadata objects; property methods accessing internal data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data structures with no external input or output operations.",
  "flows": "Initialization of metadata objects with provided arguments; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; straightforward class and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data structures, enums, and classes used for documentation parsing. No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The constants are simple keyword sets, and the classes serve as data containers with no embedded malicious logic. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate docstring analysis, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate benign, well-structured utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of classes and constants for parsing Python docstrings. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
