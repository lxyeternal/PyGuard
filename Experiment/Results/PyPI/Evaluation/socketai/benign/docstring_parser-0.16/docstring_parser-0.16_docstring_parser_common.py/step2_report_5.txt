  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** The code is primarily data structures and constants, with no external input handling or dynamic code execution.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores seem appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes that the code is straightforward, with no external data handling or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** The code only defines enums and classes for internal use.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is described as a benign utility for docstring parsing with no external interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scores.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign, purely data structure definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, highlighting static data and no external data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- All reports agree that the code is a benign, static set of classes and constants for docstring parsing.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0. No obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no security risk.\n\n**Additional note:** Given the thorough review, I concur with the current scores and assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of data structures for docstring parsing.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.  \n- The scores are appropriate and should not be changed.",
