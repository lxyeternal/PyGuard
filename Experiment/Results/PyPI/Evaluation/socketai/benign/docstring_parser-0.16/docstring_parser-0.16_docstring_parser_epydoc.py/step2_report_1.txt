  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states the code parses epydoc-style docstrings, input is a string, no external data flow.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Processes strings locally; no external system interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; regex parsing is standard; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard parser; high confidence (0.9); malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is benign with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; input is the 'text' parameter.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or harmful actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Regex-based parsing is safe; no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, straightforward; very high confidence (0.95); malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Minimal (0).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, parsing epydoc-style docstrings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Uses regex and string operations safely; no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard; high confidence (0.95); malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n- **Security Risk:** None detected (0).\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Internal string processing only.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; regex parsing is typical; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, well-structured; high confidence (0.9); malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with prior; string parsing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or harmful actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Straightforward string and regex parsing; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe; high confidence (0.95); malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n- **Security Risk:** None.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code only performs string parsing and formatting.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports detect obfuscation; the code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal concern due to regex parsing, but overall very low.\n\n### Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily due to regex-based parsing, which is standard and safe here.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured parser and formatter for epydoc-style docstrings with no security risks or malicious intent. The reported scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes needed; the assessments are accurate and justified based on the code review.",
