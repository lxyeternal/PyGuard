  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details about code behavior, potential security risks, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a parser and renderer for Google-style Python docstrings.\n- They emphasize that the code uses standard libraries (inspect, re), regex for parsing, and string manipulations.\n- No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration are reported.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk is minimal or negligible, with some reports assigning 0 or 0.1.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), indicating strong agreement that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is a straightforward parser and formatter for docstrings.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- No data flows into dangerous sinks (file, network, eval, exec).\n- The regex patterns are standard and only used for string parsing.\n- No secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears safe, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Most assign 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable. Given the absence of any security issues, 0 is justified.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No issues justify raising the risk or malware scores above 0.\n- The code does not perform any unsafe operations, nor does it process untrusted data in a way that could cause harm.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- Some reports assign a security risk of 0.1, perhaps as a conservative buffer. However, given the analysis, 0 is more accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type     | Recommended Value | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                   | No malicious code or behavior detected                     |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                   | Code is clear, standard regex and string processing        |\n| Security Risk  | 0                   | No vulnerabilities, unsafe operations, or external calls |\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a well-structured, standard parser for Google-style docstrings. It performs string parsing and formatting with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The high confidence and the absence of any suspicious patterns support assigning all scores as zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' consensus.",
