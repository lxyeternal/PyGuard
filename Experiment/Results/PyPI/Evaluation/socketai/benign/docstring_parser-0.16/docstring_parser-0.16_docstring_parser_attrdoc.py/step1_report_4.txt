  "purpose": "This code parses Python source files to extract attribute docstrings, including class and module attributes, and adds these to a Docstring object.",
  "sources": "inspect.getsource(component) retrieves source code of the given component (class or module).",
  "sinks": "ast.parse(source) processes the source code into an AST, but does not execute code or handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Source: inspect.getsource -> AST parsing with ast.parse -> visiting AST nodes -> extracting attribute info -> adding docstrings to Docstring object.",
  "anomalies": "The code only reads source code for static analysis; no network, file, or environment variable access is present. It uses standard Python libraries with no suspicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and uses them to parse source code for attribute docstrings. It safely handles source retrieval with inspect.getsource and processes AST nodes without executing any code. The class AttributeDocstrings visits AST nodes for class/module attributes, extracting attribute names, types, default values, and associated docstrings. The add_attribute_docstrings function appends this info to a Docstring object, avoiding duplication. There is no indication of malicious behavior, code injection, network access, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a legitimate static analysis tool for documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a safe, static source code parser designed to extract attribute docstrings from Python classes and modules. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on its current implementation.",
