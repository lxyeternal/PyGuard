  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the reported findings with the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Source:** Accurate; parses docstrings from the 'text' parameter.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or dangerous sinks; strictly string parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no malicious patterns, straightforward regex.\n- **Analysis:** Standard parsing, no code injection, no external system calls.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe, no security risks.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity) — aligns with the analysis.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation) — consistent.  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk) — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe regex and string operations.  \n- No suspicious patterns, no external interactions.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n- Risk: 0 — no security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Adds mention of reading environment variables and class attributes, but no actual external system interaction is evident.\n- The code still only processes strings and regex; no dynamic code execution or external data flow.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malware activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward parsing.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — slightly higher but still minimal; no external system access or code execution.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar detailed analysis; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- Focused on safe regex and string parsing.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n- Risk: 0 — no external system or network activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with previous reports; standard static parsing.\n- No dynamic code, no external data, no obfuscation.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — safe code.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0 — no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0; the code does not execute any untrusted code, connect to networks, or perform malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low; some reports assign 0.2, but given the absence of external interactions, dynamic code execution, or data leakage, a score of 0 is more appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured parser and formatter for reStructuredText-style docstrings. It performs string parsing, regex matching, and data structuring without any malicious or insecure behavior. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the actual code behavior. No modifications to scores are necessary. The code is safe for use in any environment concerning security.",
