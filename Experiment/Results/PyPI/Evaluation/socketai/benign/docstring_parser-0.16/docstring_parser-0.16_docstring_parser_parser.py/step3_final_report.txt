{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse and compose Python docstrings in multiple styles, supporting error handling and attribute docstring parsing.",
  "sources": "Input text for parse functions, object.__doc__ attribute for parse_from_object.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data processing or external data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input text or object attributes flow into parsing functions; no external or unsafe flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for parsing and rendering docstrings using external modules. It handles exceptions gracefully, supports multiple styles, and processes attribute docstrings for classes and modules. No network activity, code injection, or data leaks are present. The external dependencies are standard and well-maintained. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for docstring parsing and composition. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are evident. The low risk scores across reports are appropriate, and the malware score remains at 0.",
