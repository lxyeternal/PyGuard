  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code, the context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report describes the code as a type-safe, well-structured wrapper for AWS Organizations, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, considering it's mainly interface definitions)\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The code is primarily method signatures, type annotations, and exception classes, typical for SDK stubs. No suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role as a type-annotated interface with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard for boto3 stubs. No malicious indicators, no obfuscated code, no secrets.\n\n**Verdict:** The score is reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard, type-annotated SDK interface with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely interface definitions, with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a structured, type-annotated client interface, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with SDK stub patterns. No suspicious patterns or malicious payloads.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides method signatures and type annotations for the boto3 client, with no malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical SDK interface, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is mainly interface definitions with no runtime logic, data leaks, or malicious code.\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, matching the straightforward, generated SDK stub pattern.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — justified, as no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — justified, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** 0 to 0.1 — appropriate, given the code is purely interface/stub code with no runtime or external data handling.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nConsidering all reports and the code:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk, as it's just type annotations and method signatures.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately scored. The code appears to be a legitimate, auto-generated SDK stub for AWS Organizations, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
