{
  "purpose": "This code provides a type-annotated interface for the AWS Organizations client, facilitating interaction with AWS services via boto3 with type hints.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; method parameters and properties, especially **kwargs with type definitions; potentially dynamic get_paginator method overloads.",
  "sinks": "None evident—no untrusted data sources, no network calls or file operations directly in this code snippet; method calls are placeholders for boto3 client operations.",
  "flows": "Method signatures define source-to-sink flows: input parameters (kwargs) flow into boto3 client calls, and responses or exceptions are returned or raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code structure aligns with standard boto3 stub interfaces. The get_paginator method overloads are typical for boto3 clients with multiple paginated operations. No evidence of malicious code injection or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, type-annotated Python interface for AWS Organizations, designed for type safety and IDE support. It contains no runtime logic or data processing; all methods are signatures mapping to boto3's client methods. The exception class definitions list all relevant AWS exceptions. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious payloads are present. The implementation follows standard patterns for boto3 stubs and does not include any harmful or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, typical boto3 type stub for the AWS Organizations client, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It purely defines method signatures and exception types for static analysis and IDE support.",
