  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS Organizations service, providing methods to interact with AWS organizations via boto3.",
  "sources": "Code defines class methods, properties, and imports external libraries; no direct data input or external sources are processed within this code.",
  "sinks": "Method signatures and property definitions potentially accept untrusted parameters via **kwargs, which could be used in unsafe API calls if improperly handled. No direct data leakage or malicious sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (via **kwargs) flow into API request calls; however, actual implementation details are not provided here. No execution flow or data manipulation is shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a structured, well-documented interface definition with no signs of obfuscated logic, hidden code, or malicious constructs. Usage of type annotations and overloads is standard for boto3 stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a client class for AWS Organizations with method signatures, type annotations, and overloads for pagination. No executable logic, data processing, or external input handling is present beyond method signatures. The design is consistent with a generated SDK stub, aimed at type checking and IDE support. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or suspicious anomalies are detected. The imports and class structure follow standard patterns, and there are no embedded or hidden code payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, well-structured SDK stub for the AWS Organizations API, intended for type checking and IDE autocompletion. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks beyond the normal interface definitions. The code is safe and does not perform any unintended or harmful actions.",
