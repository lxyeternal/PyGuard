  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious code, logical consistency, and appropriateness of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard, well-structured, type-safe wrapper for AWS Organizations, with no signs of malicious activity. It emphasizes the absence of suspicious parameters, obfuscation, or covert behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1, confidence: 0.95\n\n- **Assessment:** Given the code is a straightforward boto3 stub with detailed type annotations, method signatures, and exception classes, and no suspicious patterns or behaviors are evident, the scores are reasonable. The small securityRisk score (0.1) could reflect a conservative stance, but since the code only defines interfaces and does not perform any operations, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a type-annotated interface with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The focus is on standard patterns and the absence of secrets or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 0.95\n\n- **Assessment:** The scores are appropriate. The securityRisk is zero because the code is purely interface definitions, with no runtime logic or data handling that could pose a risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is characterized as a type-safe, standard boto3 stub for AWS Organizations, with no malicious or suspicious activity. It emphasizes the lack of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1\n\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code content. The confidence is high, and the scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is described as a structured, type-annotated SDK stub with no executable logic, external input handling, or malicious patterns. It is intended for static analysis and IDE support.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a standard SDK stub with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report notes that the code provides a comprehensive, type-annotated interface with no suspicious external calls, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. It is deemed safe and legitimate.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 0.95\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose and structure.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code contains no executable logic, no network calls beyond standard API signatures, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), possibly reflecting a conservative stance. Given the code is purely interface definitions with no runtime or data processing, a score of 0 is more accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a static, type-annotated SDK stub for AWS Organizations, generated or written to facilitate type checking and IDE support.\n- No runtime logic, data leaks, malicious patterns, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated, with a security risk score of 0 for a more precise reflection of the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code as a standard SDK interface stub.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, standard, and safe, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores should be maintained at zero for malware and obfuscation, and security risk should be zero.",
