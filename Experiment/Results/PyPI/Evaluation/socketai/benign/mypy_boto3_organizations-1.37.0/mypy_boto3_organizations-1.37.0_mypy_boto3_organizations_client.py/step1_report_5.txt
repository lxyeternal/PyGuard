  "purpose": "Type annotations and method definitions for the boto3 Organizations client, facilitating interaction with AWS Organizations service.",
  "sources": "Imports of external modules (botocore, typing, builtins, collections.abc, typing_extensions) and the class methods that define API interactions, including request and response types.",
  "sinks": "Methods accepting kwargs unpacked from request type definitions, and methods returning response type definitions. No untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Method calls receive kwargs representing request data, which are mapped to internal request type defs, then execute API calls; responses are typed accordingly. No data flows to external sinks or malicious endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external URL calls, or backdoor code present. The code mainly defines an interface for AWS SDK interaction with detailed type annotations. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive, well-structured type annotation layer over the boto3 AWS Organizations client, including method overloads for paginators and exception handling. It strictly uses type definitions for requests and responses, with no evidence of malicious logic, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The import statements and class structure are consistent with standard SDK interface definitions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external malicious endpoints are found. The purpose appears purely to improve type safety and IDE support for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured interface for AWS Organizations SDK with enhanced type annotations. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. It appears safe and legitimate for use in secure environments.",
