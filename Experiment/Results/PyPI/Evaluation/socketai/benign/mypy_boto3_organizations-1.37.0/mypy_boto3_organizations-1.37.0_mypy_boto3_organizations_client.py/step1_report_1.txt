  "purpose": "Type annotations and client wrapper for AWS Organizations service, providing a structured interface for interacting with AWS Organizations via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, boto3 and botocore modules, and local type definitions; class method definitions with type annotations; property and method signatures for client operations and paginators.",
  "sinks": "Methods calling AWS API operations via boto3, potentially transmitting data over the network, but all are standard API calls with no suspicious parameters or behaviors. No untrusted input handling or insecure data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Client methods accepting keyword arguments unpacked from type definitions, calling AWS services, and returning API responses; no internal data processing or data flow outside API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. The code primarily consists of method signatures with clear documentation. No suspicious obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a boto3 client wrapper with extensive type annotations and method signatures for AWS Organizations operations, including exception handling and paginator creation. It is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent. The import statements and method implementations follow standard patterns for AWS SDK wrappers. There are no indicators of data leaks, backdoors, or covert channels. The code appears to be a legitimate, type-safe interface for AWS Organizations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-documented Python wrapper for AWS Organizations client, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves as a type-safe interface for AWS API operations, with no evidence of malware, sabotage, or security risks.",
