  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports agree that the code is a static, declarative set of Python TypedDict definitions used for type checking AWS Organizations API requests and responses. They emphasize that the code only defines data structures, with no runtime logic, external data processing, or network activity. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues are present in the code. The code is purely type annotations.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident.\n- **Scores & Justifications:**\n  - **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, justified by the absence of malicious code.\n  - **Security risk:** 0, consistent with the purely static nature.\n  - **Obfuscation:** 0, as the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is standard for static type definitions in Python projects, especially for SDKs.\n- The conditional imports based on Python version are typical for compatibility.\n- The data structures (TypedDicts) map directly to API request/response schemas.\n- No dynamic or runtime code, no data flow from untrusted sources, no external data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the static, safe nature, **0** is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, fully justified by the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nBased on the detailed reviews, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is entirely benign, serving as static type annotations for AWS SDK interactions.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and intended solely for static type checking support, with no malicious or security concerns.",
