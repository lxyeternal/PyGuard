{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Organizations service, providing structured data models for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, datetime, typing, and local literals; all are used for type annotations and conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or dynamic code execution are present; data is primarily used for type annotations.",
  "flows": "Type definitions and data structures are static and do not include executable data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Code is solely for type definitions, with no dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of TypedDict classes for AWS Organizations API request and response structures, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. It uses standard typing and typing_extensions for optional fields. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or runtime behavior. The imports and definitions are consistent with a static type definition module, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type annotations for AWS Organizations API, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a static schema for type checking and documentation purposes.",
