{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type definitions for AWS Organizations API request and response schemas using Python TypedDicts, serving as type hints for SDK development and static analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from type annotations and data structure definitions; no runtime data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include fields like 'Tags', 'Content', 'Description', 'Name', which could be populated with untrusted data during actual API usage, but the code itself does not process or execute this data.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code only defines data schemas. In actual use, untrusted data could flow into these structures during API calls, but this is outside the static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, well-structured static type definitions with conditional imports for compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of static type annotations for AWS Organizations API requests and responses, utilizing TypedDicts with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or network activity. The fields are typical for API schemas, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is solely for static type checking and documentation, making it inherently safe. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static collection of type definitions for AWS SDK interactions, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. It is safe for use and appropriate for static analysis tools. The scores are consistent with the code's static, declarative nature.",
