  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely static type definitions for AWS Organizations API, with no runtime or data processing.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no external data sources, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. The code is a static type definition module, safe by design.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations.\n- **Findings:** No external inputs, no dynamic logic, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a static type hinting module, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the scoring and reasoning are sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines data structures for AWS SDK, with no runtime or external data handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no code injection, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely static type definitions.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines type annotations and data structures, with potential data sinks in the form of fields accepting untrusted input (e.g., 'Tags', 'Content', 'Description', 'Name').\n- **Findings:** These fields are part of request payloads, but the code itself does not process untrusted data at runtime.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that these fields could be populated with untrusted data during actual API calls, but the code itself remains static and safe. The potential for security issues exists only in runtime usage, not in the static definitions.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring remains appropriate. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, declarative set of type definitions for AWS SDK interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified based on the static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — static type definitions pose no security risk; runtime security depends on how these are used, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, static type definition module for AWS Organizations SDK, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The current scoring and reasoning are appropriate and justified.",
