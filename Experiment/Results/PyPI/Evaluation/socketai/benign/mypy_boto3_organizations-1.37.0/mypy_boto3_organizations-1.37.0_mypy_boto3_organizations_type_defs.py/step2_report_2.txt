  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logical consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static collection of type definitions for AWS Organizations API, with no runtime logic or data processing.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data sources, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious activity.\n- **Security implication:** Zero; the code is safe.\n- **Score justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (due to the potential for misuse if misused, but generally safe).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a comprehensive set of type annotations with no dynamic or runtime logic.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code is a static schema.\n- **Security implication:** None.\n- **Score justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code defines data structures for AWS SDK with no runtime behavior.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no external data handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is a static type schema.\n- **Security implication:** None.\n- **Score justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, focusing on the static nature and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No runtime logic, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Valid; it's a straightforward type definition module.\n- **Security implication:** None.\n- **Score justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that the code defines data structures with potential for external data inputs (like 'Tags', 'Content', etc.) but clarifies that no code executes untrusted input directly.\n- **Findings:** No network calls, code injection, or dynamic execution.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code only defines data schemas.\n- **Security implication:** No active threats.\n- **Score justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code content:** All reports agree that the code is a static, purely declarative set of type annotations for AWS SDK interactions.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Essentially zero, as the code does not execute or process runtime data.\n- **Potential concerns:** The only minimal concern could be if someone misused the type definitions to mask malicious code, but nothing in the code suggests that.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard static type definitions module with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, static collection of type annotations for AWS Organizations API. It contains no runtime logic, no external data processing, and no security vulnerabilities. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
