{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the AWS Organizations service SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, datetime, typing, and local literals; all data structure definitions; type annotations within classes and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data structures accepting untrusted input (e.g., user-provided data) such as 'Tags', 'Content', 'Description', 'Name', and API request/response objects. No code executes untrusted input directly; no network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs into request objects, and then through SDK methods (not shown here). No runtime data handling or execution is implemented within this module itself.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. Use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for the AWS Organizations SDK, employing Python's typing and TypedDict to specify data structures. It includes imports, conditional type aliasing for compatibility, and numerous data classes for requests, responses, and entity representations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network calls, data leaks, or code injection. The code appears to be purely declarative, serving as type annotations for API interaction. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code segments were detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains purely structural type definitions for a client SDK, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage code. It is a standard type annotation file for a Python SDK, designed for clarity and compatibility across Python versions. It poses no security threat.",
