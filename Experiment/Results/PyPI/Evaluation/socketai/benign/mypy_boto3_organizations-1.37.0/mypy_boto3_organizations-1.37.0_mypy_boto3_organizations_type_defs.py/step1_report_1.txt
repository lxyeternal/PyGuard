{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for organizations service API requests and responses, facilitating static type checking for the boto3_stubs library.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, datetime, typing, and local literals; class and type alias definitions; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; code only defines data structures, no runtime data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all definitions are static and do not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code solely consists of typed dictionaries and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of Python TypedDict class definitions used for type annotations in a boto3 client stub. It imports standard modules, performs conditional imports based on Python version, and defines numerous data structures for request and response payloads. There are no dynamic or runtime operations, no untrusted input handling, no code execution, and no network activity. The structure is typical for static type definition modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, providing type annotations for AWS Organizations API requests and responses. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious activity, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code is safe and intended for static type checking support.",
