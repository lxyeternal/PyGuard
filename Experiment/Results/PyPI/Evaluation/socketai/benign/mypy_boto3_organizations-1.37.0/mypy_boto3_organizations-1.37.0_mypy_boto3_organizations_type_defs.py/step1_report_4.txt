{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for AWS Organizations service using Python TypedDicts for static type checking.",
  "sources": "It reads only type annotations, imported literals, and system version info; no runtime data sources or external inputs.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks that process untrusted input; all data is statically defined or type-annotated structures.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code strictly defines types and data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely focused on defining data type structures for AWS SDK response/request types using TypedDict and conditional imports based on Python version. It imports literals and system info for compatibility but does not execute any logic or data processing. No functions, network calls, or dynamic execution present. The code appears to be a standard, static type definition module for SDKs, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type definitions module for AWS Organizations SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a static typing aid for developers and static analysis tools.",
