{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Organizations service data structures to facilitate type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys module for version checks, local literals, and standard typing modules; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Type definitions assign data structures with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or untrusted inputs; no sinks that process untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code is purely declarative type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; the code strictly defines data structures without dynamic logic or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations for AWS Organizations SDK responses and requests. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, type aliasing, and numerous TypedDict definitions with explicit key types. There are no functions, no dynamic execution, no data processing, or external data inputs. The code appears to be a static, well-structured type definition module. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, and the overall structure aligns with standard practices for type hinting in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static type definition module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to provide type annotations for AWS Organizations SDK, with no runtime behavior or external data handling that could be exploited.",
