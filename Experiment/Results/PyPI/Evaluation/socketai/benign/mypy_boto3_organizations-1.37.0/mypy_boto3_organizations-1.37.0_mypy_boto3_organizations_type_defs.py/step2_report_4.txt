  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely type definitions for AWS Organizations API, with no runtime or dynamic code. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed. The report concludes it's safe, with high confidence.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static, declarative, and solely for type annotations. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues are present.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk is 0, which aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a static set of type annotations with no dynamic or runtime logic. No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is a comprehensive static type schema, with conditional imports for compatibility, and no runtime operations.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a static set of type annotations for AWS SDK, with no dynamic execution, external data, or malicious patterns. No obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines type annotations for AWS Organizations SDK, with some mention of potential data sinks like 'Tags', 'Content', 'Description', 'Name'—these are just data fields, not executable code. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The mention of \"potential sinks\" refers to data fields that could be populated with untrusted data, but the code itself does not process or execute this data. The analysis correctly states that the code is purely declarative.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that the code is a set of static type definitions with no runtime logic, no data processing, no external data handling, and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code content. The code is purely for static type checking and documentation.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a static, purely declarative set of type definitions for AWS SDK, with no runtime, dynamic, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a well-structured static type schema, serving as a helpful tool for type checking and IDE support, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
