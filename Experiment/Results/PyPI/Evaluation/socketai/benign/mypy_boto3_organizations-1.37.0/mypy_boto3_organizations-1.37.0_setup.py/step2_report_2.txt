  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n- It reads a local README.md for the long description.\n- It specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, URLs, and package data.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or user inputs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- All reports consistently identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical setup scripts.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None apparent. The code appears correct and standard.\n\n- **Scores assigned by reports:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n  These are reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Logical consistency:\n\n- The reports' reasoning is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The code's purpose is clear, and no assumptions about malicious intent are made without evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical setup script with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It reads static files, defines static metadata, and uses well-known libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. The script poses no security risk.",
