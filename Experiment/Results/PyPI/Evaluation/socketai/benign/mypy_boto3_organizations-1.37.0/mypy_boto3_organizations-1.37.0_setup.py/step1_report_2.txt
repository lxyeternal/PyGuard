{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package 'mypy-boto3-organizations' used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package metadata from the setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from the file system (reading README.md) into the setup parameters; no flow from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script using setuptools. It imports Path for file handling, reads a README.md for long description, and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and package data. No dynamic code execution, no network connections, no environment variable manipulations, or other suspicious activity are present. All the code appears straightforward and consistent with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
