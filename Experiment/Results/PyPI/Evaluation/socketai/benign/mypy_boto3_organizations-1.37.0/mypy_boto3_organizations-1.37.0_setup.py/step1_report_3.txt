  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package 'mypy-boto3-organizations' intended for distribution via PyPI, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, imports standard libraries, and uses setup() for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes to files, executes external commands, or manipulates sensitive data directly.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for description, supplies package metadata and dependencies to setup(). No untrusted data input flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. All code uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, reading a Markdown file for description, and calling setup() with package info. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The dependencies and URLs appear legitimate and static. The code adheres to typical setup script patterns with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious elements detected.",
