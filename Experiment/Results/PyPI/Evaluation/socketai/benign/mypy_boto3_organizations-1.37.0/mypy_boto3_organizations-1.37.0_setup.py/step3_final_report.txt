  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-organizations package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads local file, then passes static data to setuptools.setup() without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for the long description and specifies static package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic or untrusted data inputs, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely package configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
