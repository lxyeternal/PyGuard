  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-organizations'. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; defining package data and dependencies; static string values for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external locations or processed from untrusted sources within this script.",
  "flows": "The script reads local files and defines package parameters; no untrusted data flows or external data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or code execution beyond standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, external inputs, or suspicious patterns. All strings and file reads are static, with no signs of malicious activity. The code's structure is typical for Python package setup files. No anomalies, no backdoors, no credential leaks, and no malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal, benign Python setup configuration file with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
