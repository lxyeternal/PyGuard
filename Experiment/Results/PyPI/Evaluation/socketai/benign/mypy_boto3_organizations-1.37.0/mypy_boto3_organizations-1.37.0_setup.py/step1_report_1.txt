  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the Python library 'mypy-boto3-organizations'.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file's directory to load README.md for long description; uses setuptools.setup() to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input source (reading README.md) flows into the setup() call for metadata; no other data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic detected. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads a Markdown README file for the long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No external input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script used for packaging a Python library. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
