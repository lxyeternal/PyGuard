{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS SDK enumerations and identifiers to facilitate type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to variables, imported conditionally based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data handling or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "None; purely static type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for type annotations with conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string literal type definitions for AWS SDK enumerations, with no dynamic code, input handling, network operations, or secrets. The conditional import for 'Literal' is standard for compatibility. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present. The code serves as a static type safety aid, likely auto-generated or maintained for SDK documentation and static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The module is benign, purely declarative, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly identify its static and safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence.",
