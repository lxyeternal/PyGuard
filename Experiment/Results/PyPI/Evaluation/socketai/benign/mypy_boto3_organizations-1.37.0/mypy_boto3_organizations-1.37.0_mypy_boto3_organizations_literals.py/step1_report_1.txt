  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS SDK enumerations and identifiers used in the boto3 organizations service.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to variables representing different API parameter values and resource identifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted input or data; the code only defines type aliases and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code purely defines literals and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs observed. Usage of conditional import based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS SDK literals, including various status, action, resource, and paginator identifiers. It uses standard Python conditional import to support different Python versions, which is common practice. No user input handling, network operations, or data processing exists. The literals are static, predefined values used for type safety. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign set of type aliases for AWS SDK string literals, aiding static type checking. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
