{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS Organizations-related enumerations and constants for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions; definitions of string literal types.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted input or perform actions based on external data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code purely defines constants and types without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward static type definitions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. It defines a large set of string literal types used for AWS SDK enumerations, likely auto-generated or maintained for type safety. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or sensitive operations. The content appears to be purely declarative, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical static type declaration module for AWS SDK constants, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a type safety aid, not as executable or data-processing code.",
