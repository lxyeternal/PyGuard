  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS organization service related identifiers to ensure type safety and consistency across the codebase.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, and conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None, as the code primarily defines type aliases and does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only declares type annotations and does not involve data flow or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code contains standard type alias definitions with no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of Literal type aliases used for defining specific string values in a type-safe manner. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears to be solely for type hinting and documentation purposes. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely declarative, providing type hints for AWS organization-related identifiers. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
