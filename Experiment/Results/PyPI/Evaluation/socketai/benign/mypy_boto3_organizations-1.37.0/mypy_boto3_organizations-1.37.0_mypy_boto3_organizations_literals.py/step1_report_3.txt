  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS Organizations service and related enumerations, facilitating type safety and code clarity in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Type annotation assignments and conditional import statements based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only declares type aliases without executing untrusted data handling or external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily static type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Usage of conditional import based on Python version is standard. The code is purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS organizations literals, including various string literal types for enumerations used in boto3. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard practice. No runtime code execution, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. All content is static type definitions without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, purely declarative set of type annotations for AWS boto3 stub types. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It is standard, safe, and intended to improve type safety in code using AWS SDK.",
