  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for AWS organizations service literals used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type alias assignments for various literal string types.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from external inputs to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward, primarily defining type literals. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports conditional typing extensions for Python compatibility, then defines multiple Literal type aliases representing fixed sets of string values for AWS organizations-related entities. It includes no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data processing. All definitions are static and intended solely for type checking. The code structure and content are typical for type annotation modules and do not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a benign, static type definition module for AWS SDK literals. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The primary purpose is to improve type safety in type-checked Python projects. No security concerns or malware are present.",
