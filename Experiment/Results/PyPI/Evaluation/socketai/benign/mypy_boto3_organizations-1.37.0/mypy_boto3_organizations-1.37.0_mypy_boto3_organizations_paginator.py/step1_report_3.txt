{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginators for the boto3 'organizations' service client, enabling type-checked pagination over various AWS organization resources.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from type definitions, system version info, and boto3's Paginator and PageIterator classes; it also implicitly relies on data returned by the get_paginator method of the client.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods pass untrusted keyword arguments (**kwargs) to boto3's paginator; these could potentially be exploited if boto3 internally mishandles or executes untrusted input, but this is standard for boto3's design and not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Sources (kwargs passed to paginate) flow into boto3's Paginator.paginate, which then returns a PageIterator of responses; no direct data leaks or malicious data flows are evident beyond typical paginator usage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual control flow are present. The code is primarily boilerplate for type annotations and class definitions for paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines strongly-typed paginator classes for the boto3 'organizations' service, following standard practices for type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version. It utilizes type definitions for request and response types, extends the Paginator base class, and provides paginate methods with type hints. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The code is purely structural, enabling type safety and IDE support, with no evidence of harmful intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is safe and standard for a typed boto3 paginator module. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It serves as a type-safe wrapper around boto3's pagination, with no security risks beyond those inherent in the boto3 library itself.",
