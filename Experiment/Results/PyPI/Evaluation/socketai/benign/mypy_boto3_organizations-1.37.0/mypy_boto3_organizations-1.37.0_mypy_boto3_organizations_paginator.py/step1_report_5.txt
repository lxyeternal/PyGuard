{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Organizations service client, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Code reads class and method definitions, imports, and type annotations. It does not handle user input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that process untrusted data; it defines classes and methods with no data leakage or external effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines paginator classes and methods for API response iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code appears to be a standard type-annotated paginator implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for various AWS Organizations API responses, using standard Python typing, conditional imports, and class inheritance. It imports necessary types, sets up base classes with conditional typing based on Python version, and provides override methods for pagination. No external data processing, network access, or potentially malicious behavior is present. The structure follows typical boto3-stubs patterns, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of paginator class definitions for AWS boto3 stubs, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It mainly provides type annotations and pagination logic for safe API response handling.",
