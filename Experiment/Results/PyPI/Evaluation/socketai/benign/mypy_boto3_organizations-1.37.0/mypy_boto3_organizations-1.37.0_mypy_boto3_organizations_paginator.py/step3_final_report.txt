  "purpose": "Defines type annotations and paginator classes for boto3's organizations client to facilitate type safety and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Standard imports, class inheritance, and method signatures passing **kwargs to super().paginate()",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, no network activity, no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Method calls passing kwargs into boto3's paginator's paginate method, which is standard",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions inheriting from a generic Paginator, with type annotations and straightforward paginate methods. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The code is purely structural, aimed at static typing support for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, purpose-built for type safety, and contains no malicious activity or obfuscation. The high risk scores are conservative but justified given the code's role as boilerplate for SDK support.",
