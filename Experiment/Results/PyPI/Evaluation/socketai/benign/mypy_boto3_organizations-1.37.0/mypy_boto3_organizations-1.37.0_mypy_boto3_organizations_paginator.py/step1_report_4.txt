  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginators for the boto3 Organizations client, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods calling 'client.get_paginator'.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Paginator classes' paginate methods accept kwargs, but do not execute or pass data outside the scope. No data leaks or malicious actions observed.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be autogenerated with extensive type annotations, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution found.",
  "analysis": "The script defines strongly typed paginator classes for the boto3 Organizations client, utilizing type definitions and standard class inheritance. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior detected. The structure aligns with standard SDK wrapper patterns, aimed at enhancing static typing support. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, hidden backdoors, or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a type-safe wrapper for boto3 paginators, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be well-structured, purpose-specific, and free from malicious behavior.",
