  "purpose": "Define paginators for AWS Organizations service with type annotations for boto3, facilitating paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Type definitions imported from .type_defs, sys.version_info for version checks, and method parameters for paginate methods.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods which accept arbitrary keyword arguments (**kwargs) that are unpacked into specific type definitions for API request parameters.",
  "flows": "From the paginate methods receiving **kwargs, unpacked into request type definitions, and returning PageIterator objects with response type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code primarily consists of class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations. No dynamic code execution or network activity is present. The comments are documentation links, and there are no obfuscated patterns or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type-annotated paginator class definitions that inherit from a generic Paginator base. The classes define a paginate method with specific type annotations and documentation links. The code checks Python version to import Unpack conditionally. All imported types are from local modules or standard libraries. No runtime code or malicious behaviors are evident. No external data reads or writes occur within this snippet. The structure aligns with typical boto3-stubs generated code for type safety, with no suspicious patterns or embedded payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of paginator class definitions with type annotations for AWS Organizations boto3 client. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It is a well-structured, documentation-enhanced type definition module for paginators. Overall security risk is minimal.",
