  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as an interface for AWS Organizations SDK, mainly importing classes and setting up documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing or security-critical operations.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; standard SDK wrapper.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly describes the code as an SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None; standard setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a module setup for AWS SDK wrappers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or untrusted input.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid, no malicious intent observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Properly describes the code as SDK wrapper with documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or runtime data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct, standard SDK setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the code as an interface and documentation, which is correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly concludes the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** The code is purely an SDK interface with no security risks; scores of 0 are justified.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the consistent benign nature of the code across all reports, I agree with the assigned scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are thorough, accurate, and justified. The code is safe, standard SDK wrapper code with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
