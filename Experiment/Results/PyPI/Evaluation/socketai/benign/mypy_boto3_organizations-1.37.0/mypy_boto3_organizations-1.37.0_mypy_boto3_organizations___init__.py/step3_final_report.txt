{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module providing an interface to AWS Organizations SDK classes and paginators, facilitating their import and usage in other projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports classes from local modules (.client and .paginator) and defines an alias.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely sets up class imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup module that imports SDK classes and paginators, defines a client alias, and exports these components via __all__. It includes comprehensive documentation and usage examples. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations are involved. The structure and content are typical for SDK wrapper modules, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
