{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for managing AWS Organizations services, including importing and exposing various paginator classes and a client class for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator) and assignments to create a type alias (Client). No external or untrusted sources are explicitly read from.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved. The code does not perform network operations, data storage, or external command executions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly imports and definitions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are observed. The code appears to be a standard module setup for AWS SDK wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The script imports classes and functions from internal modules and defines a type alias for a client. It then exports these components via __all__. There are no indications of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code structure is typical for SDK wrapper modules, with no external data sources or sinks, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated code. The copyright statement and documentation link are harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module setup for AWS Organizations SDK wrappers. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a standard, safe component meant for SDK usage.",
