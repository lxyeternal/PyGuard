  "purpose": "This code provides a main interface and documentation for interacting with AWS Organizations service via boto3 and associated paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), string documentation, and assignments within the code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs that process untrusted data. No network, file, or environment variable usage found.",
  "flows": "The code mainly defines classes and aliases without runtime data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. Documentation link present but not suspicious. No code execution, data manipulation, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, class and variable definitions, and documentation. It provides an organized interface for AWS Organizations client and paginator classes. No runtime data processing, user input handling, or potentially malicious operations are present. No external data sources or sinks are invoked or referenced. The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper or interface setup, with clear structure and no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, benign interface and documentation for AWS SDK usage, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and intended for developer use.",
