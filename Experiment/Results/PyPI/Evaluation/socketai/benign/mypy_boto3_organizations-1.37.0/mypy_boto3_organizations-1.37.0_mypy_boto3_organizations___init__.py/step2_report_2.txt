  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward SDK wrapper for AWS Organizations, importing classes, defining a client alias, and exporting components.\n- No dynamic data processing, user input, or external data sources are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The documentation and usage examples are standard and benign.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious activity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and primarily a wrapper or interface setup.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are identified.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and do not suggest any hidden malicious intent.\n- The purpose, sources, sinks, flows, and anomalies are all aligned with benign SDK wrapper code.\n- The documentation is extensive but harmless.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed reviews, the code appears to be a standard, safe interface for AWS SDK interaction with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with all reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious or security concerns.",
