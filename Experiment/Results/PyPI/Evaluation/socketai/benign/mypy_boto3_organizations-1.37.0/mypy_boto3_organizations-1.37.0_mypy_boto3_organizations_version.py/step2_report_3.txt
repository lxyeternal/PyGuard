  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Content Review:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- The code is static, with no inputs, outputs, or external interactions.\n- The only potential anomaly noted is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming October 2023).\n\n**Logical and Security Analysis:**\n- The code is minimal and standard for defining a version string.\n- No dynamic or malicious behavior is present.\n- The future copyright year is an anomaly but not a security concern or malicious.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No malicious activity or code is present.\n   - The code is purely declarative, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n3. **Security Risk Score:**\n   - All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n   - No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n4. **Risk Score:**\n   - All reports assign 0 or 0.9 confidence levels.\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The only point of contention is the future copyright year, which is an anomaly but not a security risk.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Errors:**\n- The second report assigns a confidence of 0.9, citing the future year as suspicious. This is reasonable but does not elevate the overall security risk.\n- All other reports confidently assign 1, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at 0.\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe existing scores are consistent with the code and analysis. The only minor note is the future year anomaly, which does not warrant a higher risk score.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\nThis code is a standard, benign version declaration with a minor anomaly in the copyright year.",
