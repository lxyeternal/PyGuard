  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and evaluate the correctness of their assessments, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any additional concerns should be raised.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code in question is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- All reports agree that there are no data flows, external inputs, or suspicious patterns.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is not inherently malicious but may be outdated or placeholder info.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No issues, benign code.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully appropriate. No problems.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with a note on the future year (2025).\n- **Scores:** confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** The slightly lower confidence is reasonable given the future year anomaly. No malicious intent or security risk is identified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward version declaration.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, minimal code.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with mention of the static version string.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign malware=0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**However,** the only point of potential concern is the future copyright year (2025). While this isn't malicious, it might indicate outdated or placeholder information, which could be worth noting in a security review. Still, it doesn't impact security directly.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- **Additional considerations:** No changes needed; the code is trivial and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Estimated overall scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security concern. The only minor note is the future copyright year, which is not a security issue but could be updated for accuracy.",
