  "purpose": "Defines the version of a package or module, serving as a source of truth for versioning information.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a string to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could leak or cause effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; the code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets a version string for the package, with a copyright statement. There are no dynamic operations, no data input or output, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard version declaration file. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It functions solely as a source of version information.",
