  "purpose": "Define the package version in a static variable.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year '2025' which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string with no dynamic or external data. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The only anomaly is the future year, which is likely a placeholder or oversight, not a security concern. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent.",
