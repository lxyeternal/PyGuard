  "purpose": "Defines a version string as the source of truth for the package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable from a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with a future year (2025), which is suspicious and inconsistent with the current date. No other unusual code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright statement with an implausible future year, and a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. The future copyright year is potentially an anomaly indicating outdated or placeholder information, but does not pose a security risk or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simple and benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which could suggest outdated or placeholder information but does not affect security.",
