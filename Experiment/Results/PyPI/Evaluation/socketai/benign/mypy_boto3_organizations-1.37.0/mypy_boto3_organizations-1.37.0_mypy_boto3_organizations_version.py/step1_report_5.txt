  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '1.37.0' to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, straightforward assignment with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version string is common practice.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string for the package, with a copyright comment at the top. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external data access, and no dynamic code execution. The version string appears static and standard. The only potential concern could be the copyright year being in the future (2025), but that is not malicious behavior, just an inconsistency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with a copyright comment. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and is typical in package versioning.",
