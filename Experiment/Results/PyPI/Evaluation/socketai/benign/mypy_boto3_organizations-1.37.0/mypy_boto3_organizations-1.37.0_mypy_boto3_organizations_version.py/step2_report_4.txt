  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No dynamic code, user input, or external data interactions are involved.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are identified.\n- The only noted anomaly is the copyright year being in the future (2025), which is likely a placeholder or oversight but not a security concern.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of the code:**  \n   The code is simply a variable assignment with comments; the issues are not present in the code itself but in the metadata (e.g., future copyright year).\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward. The only \"anomaly\" is the future year, which is not a security risk.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity. Confidence scores are high, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since no malicious behavior, dynamic code, or external data handling exists, higher scores are unjustified. The reports' current scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score of 0 is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The only minor concern is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it is not a security issue but perhaps an oversight or placeholder.\n- No changes needed to the scores; they are appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a simple, static version declaration.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- Scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0**. The only potential update could be to note the copyright year as an anomaly, but it does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to prepare a summarized report or further analyze any aspect?**",
