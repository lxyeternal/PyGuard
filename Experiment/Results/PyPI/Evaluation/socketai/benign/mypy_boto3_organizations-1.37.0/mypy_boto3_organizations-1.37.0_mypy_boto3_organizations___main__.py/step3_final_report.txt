  "purpose": "Provide package information and version details via CLI based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input; sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs static strings; no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Input argument check (sys.argv) leading to static output functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version info based on command-line arguments. It imports only sys, performs no dynamic data handling, network calls, or credential management. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign with no malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0; a minor report assigns 0.1, which is inconsistent with the benign nature and should be adjusted to 0. The confidence in these assessments is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate; the slight inconsistency in one report's risk score should be corrected to 0. The overall security assessment is that the package is safe for use.",
