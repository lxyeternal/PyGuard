  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs information to stdout)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs package info and version details)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() -> output version; otherwise, print_info() outputs package info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or external network calls",
  "analysis": "The script functions solely as a CLI utility to display package info and version details. It reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and outputs static, predefined strings to stdout. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and adheres to expected CLI patterns. No anomalies or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
