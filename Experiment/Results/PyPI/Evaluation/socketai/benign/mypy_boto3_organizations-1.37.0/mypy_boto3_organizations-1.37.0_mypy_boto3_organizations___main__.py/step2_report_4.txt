  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It imports only `sys`.\n- It defines two functions: `print_info()` and `print_version()`, both outputting static, predefined strings.\n- The `main()` function checks for the `--version` argument to decide which info to print.\n- No external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present\n- The code matches the described purpose: providing package info and version via CLI.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or external interactions are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and safe.\n- No discrepancies or logical flaws are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n**Note:** The only minor point is that one report assigns a `securityRisk` score of 0.1, which seems slightly inconsistent given the complete benign nature. But this is a minor detail.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each report\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is correct.\n- `obfuscated: 0` is appropriate.\n- `securityRisk` is mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1—still acceptable given the benign code.\n- Confidence is high (1 or 1.0), which is reasonable.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are consistent with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify any high risk scores\n- All scores for malware are 0; no justification needed.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, matching the benign nature.\n- No reason to elevate risk scores given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Malware scores and malicious behavior\n- No malicious behavior, code injection, backdoors, or external communications.\n- The code is static and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score should remain 0.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- All reports correctly assume no vulnerabilities, as the code is static and straightforward.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are unfounded.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores with reports\n- All reports are consistent with their assigned scores.\n- No contradictions or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n### Final step: My own assessment\n**Based on all information:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, benign CLI utility with no malicious or security issues. All reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Overall recommendation:**  \nThe code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No further action or concern is necessary.",
