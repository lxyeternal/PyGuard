  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs package info or version info based on command-line arguments.\n- It imports only `sys`, performs straightforward print operations.\n- No external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, or credential handling.\n- The code is static, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, and the reports correctly identify that it performs benign operations.\n\n- **Malicious behavior?**  \n  No. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, reasoning, and logic:\n- The reports uniformly agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and safe.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or hidden behaviors are detected.\n- The code's purpose is purely informational, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malware is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. Correct, as the code is clear and simple.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Most reports assign `0`, with one report giving `0.1`.  \n  Given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, a score of 0 is justified. The `0.1` seems slightly arbitrary and should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, and all agree on no security risk.\n- The code is benign; no reason to increase the risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and reasoning:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as 0.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one at 0.1, which is slightly inconsistent given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and align well with the code.\n- The slight variation in security risk score (0.1) can be standardized to 0 for clarity.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the code and reports, **the scores should be:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0**\n\nThis reflects the benign, straightforward nature of the script, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
