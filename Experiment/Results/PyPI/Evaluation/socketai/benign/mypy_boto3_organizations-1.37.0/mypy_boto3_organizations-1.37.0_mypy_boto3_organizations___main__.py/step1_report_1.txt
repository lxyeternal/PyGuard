  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint for a package providing boto3 Organizations type annotations and version info.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (outputs info)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs package info and version), no other sinks identified",
  "flows": "Input: command-line argument '--version' -> Output: version info or package info printed to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors. Functions perform straightforward print operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple CLI interface that responds to a '--version' argument by printing version info, or otherwise outputs package details. It imports sys for I/O, uses standard functions with no external or dangerous calls. No data is received from untrusted sources, no data is transmitted externally, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a benign CLI utility without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign CLI script for informational output. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are detected.",
