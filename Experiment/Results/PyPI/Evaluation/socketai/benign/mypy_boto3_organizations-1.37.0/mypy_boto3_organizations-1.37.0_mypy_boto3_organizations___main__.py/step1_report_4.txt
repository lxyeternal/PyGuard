  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 Organizations, including version and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; no untrusted data processing present",
  "flows": "User input (--version) triggers version info output; otherwise, package info is printed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code only reads command-line arguments and writes static package information to stdout. There are no external data sources, no dynamic execution, no credential handling, and no network activity. The logic is simple and safe. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package details. It shows no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
