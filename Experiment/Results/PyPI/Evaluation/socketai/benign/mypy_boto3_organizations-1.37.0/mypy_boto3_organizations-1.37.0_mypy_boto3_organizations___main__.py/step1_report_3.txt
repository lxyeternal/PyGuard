  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 Organizations and its version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes information to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument as input source -> Calls print_version (output) or print_info (output) to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no unusual behaviors, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply provides CLI commands to display package info and version. It reads command-line arguments to decide which information to print. The data printed is static and informational. No external data is fetched, no network connections, no code injection, or malicious payloads present. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, and no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign CLI script intended for informational purposes. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code.",
