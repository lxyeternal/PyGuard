{
  "purpose": "Provides geometry analysis and manipulation functions, mainly delegating to external 'lib' functions for querying and transforming geometries.",
  "sources": "Functions read geometry data and parameters, passing them to 'lib' functions; no external data sources or input streams.",
  "sinks": "Delegates to 'lib' functions; no network, file I/O, or external system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Input geometries flow into 'lib' functions which process and return results; no external data leaks or command executions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard warnings for version compatibility are used.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of wrapper functions around shapely's core 'lib' functions, providing geometry type queries, property access, and modifications. It employs standard decorators for threading and version requirements. No external network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The functions process geometries in memory, delegating to trusted underlying libraries. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation, reflecting a low security risk primarily associated with processing untrusted geometries but no active vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper for shapely's geometry functions, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low risk scores are appropriate given its nature. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is very low risk, and the assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
