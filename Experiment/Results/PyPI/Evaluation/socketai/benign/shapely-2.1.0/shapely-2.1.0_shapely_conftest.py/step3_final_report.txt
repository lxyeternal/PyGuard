  "purpose": "Configuration setup for pytest and scipy-doctest for the Shapely library, including version reporting and warning filtering.",
  "sources": "Imports of numpy, pytest, shapely.geos_version_string; conditional import of scipy_doctest.conftest; version variables; warning filters within context manager.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or code execution points; warning filters suppress benign warnings; no data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Version info and warning filters are set during test setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward configuration code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test configuration script for a Python project, managing optional dependencies, filtering known benign warnings, and reporting version info. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute malicious code. The warning filtering is for known benign issues, and the optional import is standard practice. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0—are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
