{
  "purpose": "Configure pytest and scipy-doctest for testing Shapely, including conditional imports and warning filtering.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from geos_version_string and numpy.__version__, imports scipy_doctest.conftest, warnings, and contextlib, and uses modules like doctest and warnings within the context manager.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions are present. No network, file, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and version info are read at startup; the context manager filters warnings during testing; no external data flow or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard import and warning filtering patterns. The use of try-except to conditionally import scipy_doctest is common and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up testing configurations for pytest and scipy-doctest, including version reporting and warning suppression. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The conditional import and warning filters are standard practices. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration for testing in a Python project involving Shapely, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or malicious data handling.",
