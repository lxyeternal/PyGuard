  "purpose": "Configuration setup for pytest and scipy-doctest for the Shapely library, including version reporting and warning filtering.",
  "sources": "Reads geos_version_string, numpy.__version__, and module import attempts for scipy_doctest.conftest.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks, code execution, or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Source: import statements and version strings -> used in report header and configuration variables. No flow leading to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code manipulates warnings and test configurations but does not include suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up testing configurations and warning filters. It conditionally imports modules, sets version strings, and configures test behaviors. No external inputs or untrusted data flows to security-sensitive operations. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing configuration script for a Python project, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
