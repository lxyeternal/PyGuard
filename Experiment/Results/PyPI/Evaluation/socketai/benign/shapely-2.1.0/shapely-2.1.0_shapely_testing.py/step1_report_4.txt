  "sinks": "build_err_msg (string construction for error reporting)",
  "flows": "Input geometries → various comparison functions and NaN handling → AssertionError messages",
  "anomalies": "Use of shapely.transform with a function replacing NaN with 0.0, which could potentially mask issues; no external data input handling; no network or system command calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs geometry comparison with tolerance, NaN, and None handling, using shapely functions and numpy. It suppresses invalid warnings during comparison, replaces NaN coordinates with zeros to enable exact comparison, and raises assertions with detailed messages on mismatch. The use of shapely.get_coordinates and shapely.transform appears to be standard for geometry handling. The build_err_msg function constructs verbose error messages, including array representations. No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are present. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a testing utility focused on geometry comparison, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles NaN and None values explicitly and raises assertions on inequality. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
