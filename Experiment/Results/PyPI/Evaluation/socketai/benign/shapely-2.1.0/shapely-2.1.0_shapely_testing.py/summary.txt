  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for comparing shapely geometries with detailed handling of NaN and None values. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0) and risk score (~0.1) are justified and consistent with its purpose as a testing utility."
