  "purpose": "Build setup for a Python package with C extensions and optional Cython compilation, involving GEOS and NumPy dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, subprocess calls to 'geos-config', filesystem checks, command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "subprocess execution, file deletion routines, environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and subprocess outputs influence build configuration; command-line arguments control cleanup/build routines.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with 'geos-config' is standard; file deletion patterns are typical but could be manipulated if patterns are overly broad.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build configuration tasks, including environment checks, subprocess calls to external utilities, and cleanup routines. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments are present. The reliance on environment variables and subprocess calls is typical but could be exploited if the environment is compromised; however, no evidence suggests malicious intent. The file deletion routines are routine for build cleanup but should be used cautiously. Overall, the script aligns with common build practices and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard build setup script with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low risk score of 0.2 and malware score of 0 are appropriate given the context. No adjustments are necessary.",
