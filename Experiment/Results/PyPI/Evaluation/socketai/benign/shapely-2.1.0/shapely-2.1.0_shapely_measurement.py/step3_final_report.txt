{
  "purpose": "Provides geometric measurement functions such as area, distance, bounds, length, etc., delegating computations to shapely.lib core functions.",
  "sources": "Input geometries passed directly to shapely.lib functions, including Geometry objects or array-like structures.",
  "sinks": "No external system interactions; data flows are internal within the library functions.",
  "flows": "Input geometries → wrapper functions → shapely.lib core functions → numerical outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external side effects detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward wrapper functions around shapely's core geometry functions, with proper documentation and examples. Usage of decorators like multithreading_enabled is standard. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The functions process geometries and return numerical results, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is well-structured, safe, and aligns with typical spatial computation libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of geometric measurement functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
