{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for measuring geometric properties such as area, bounds, distances, and other spatial metrics using the shapely library.",
  "sources": "Imports from shapely and numpy libraries; calls to lib functions for geometry calculations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations like network access, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input geometries are processed through lib functions; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names. The code is straightforward, serving mathematical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions for geometric measurements, each wrapping corresponding lib functions from shapely. The functions include parameters for multithreading and densify options for certain distance metrics. Examples demonstrate typical usage. No signs of code injection, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. The code primarily performs geometric calculations without external side effects. No suspicious external calls or data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of geometry measurement functions with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It safely wraps shapely lib functions for geometric analysis, with no indication of sabotage or malware.",
