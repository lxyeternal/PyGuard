  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of geometric measurement functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
