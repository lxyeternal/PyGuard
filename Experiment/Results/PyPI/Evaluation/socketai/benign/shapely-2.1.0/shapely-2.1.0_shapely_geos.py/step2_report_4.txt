  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports `warnings` and `shapely`.\n- Issues a `DeprecationWarning` about the `shapely.geos` module being deprecated.\n- Assigns three attributes from `shapely` (`geos_capi_version_string`, `geos_version`, `geos_capi_version`) to local variables.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code's purpose is to notify users about deprecation and expose version info.\n- It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.\n- The only noteworthy behavior is issuing a deprecation warning, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or suspicious logic.\n- The deprecation warning is a standard notification, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n- The version attribute access is safe and read-only.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The code is straightforward and serves a maintenance/compatibility purpose.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct, no malware present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no security issues.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate, as no security risk exists.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The deprecation warning does not introduce any security risk.\n- Accessing version strings is safe.\n- No external inputs or outputs that could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Work through summary:**  \nThe code is a simple deprecation notice and version info exposer with no malicious or security concerns. The scoring reflects this accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that any future code involving dynamic execution, external data, or network operations is scrutinized more thoroughly. But for this snippet, the current assessment stands correct.",
