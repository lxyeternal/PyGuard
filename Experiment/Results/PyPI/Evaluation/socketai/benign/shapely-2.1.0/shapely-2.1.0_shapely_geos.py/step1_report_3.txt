  "purpose": "Provide proxies and utility functions for GEOS-specific attributes in shapely, including a deprecation warning for the 'shapely.geos' module.",
  "sources": "Access to shapely.geos_capi_version_string, shapely.geos_version, shapely.geos_capi_version",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is being sent, written to, or transmitted to external sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only reads attributes from shapely and issues a warning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors. The code issues a deprecation warning and accesses attributes; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and shapely modules, issues a deprecation warning regarding the 'shapely.geos' module, and retrieves version information from shapely. No external data inputs, user inputs, or data leaks are present. There is no suspicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and solely provides utility functions with a deprecation warning. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
