  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code's purpose is to issue a deprecation warning about 'shapely.geos' and expose version information via attributes.\n- The code only reads attributes from the shapely module and issues a warning; no data processing, user input, or external communication occurs.\n- No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- No evidence of malicious intent, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution.\n- The deprecation warning is standard practice during library evolution.\n- The version attributes are likely static strings or simple data, not user input or untrusted data.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of security vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or overestimations:**\n- No report suggests any suspicious code, so no reason to increase scores.\n- The deprecation warning itself does not introduce risk; it’s a standard notification.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a simple utility module for version info and deprecation warning.\n- All scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) should remain at 0.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the consistent analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep all scores at 0.\n- Confirm that the code is benign and does not pose security risks.\n- The current assessments are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's straightforward nature.",
