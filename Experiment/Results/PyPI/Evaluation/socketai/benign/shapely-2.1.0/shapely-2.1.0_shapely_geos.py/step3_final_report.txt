  "purpose": "Issue a deprecation warning regarding 'shapely.geos' and expose version information from the shapely library.",
  "sources": "Reading version attributes from shapely module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data processing",
  "flows": "Deprecation warning issued, version attributes assigned to local variables",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and shapely, issues a deprecation warning about 'shapely.geos', and assigns version info to local variables. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. The purpose is purely informational and maintenance-related. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility snippet issuing a deprecation warning and exposing version info. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
