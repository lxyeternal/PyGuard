{
  "purpose": "This module provides proxies and utilities for interacting with the GEOS library within the shapely package, mainly for deprecation warnings and version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'shapely.geos_capi_version_string', 'shapely.geos_version', and 'shapely.geos_capi_version' attributes, which are likely retrieved from the shapely package's GEOS bindings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points in this code where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing shapely, issuing a deprecation warning, and then assigning version information from shapely.geos attributes to local variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a deprecation warning about 'shapely.geos', which indicates usage of deprecated features, but no unusual or suspicious behavior is present. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the shapely library, issues a DeprecationWarning about the 'shapely.geos' module, and assigns version information from shapely's geos-related attributes to local variables. The warning serves to inform users about deprecated features, encouraging transition to newer APIs. The attributes accessed are version strings, which are safe and standard. No malicious or suspicious code behavior, such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for version handling and deprecation warning notification within shapely. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of a deprecation warning indicates ongoing maintenance rather than malicious intent.",
