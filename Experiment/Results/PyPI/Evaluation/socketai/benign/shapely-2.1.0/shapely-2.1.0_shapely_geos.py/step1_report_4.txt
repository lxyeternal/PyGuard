{
  "purpose": "The code provides proxies and utility functions related to libgeos, specifically for handling GEOS versions and deprecation warnings in the shapely library.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'shapely.geos_capi_version_string', 'shapely.geos_version', and 'shapely.geos_capi_version' attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is being processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Reads version attributes from the shapely library to store in local variables; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable behavior is issuing a deprecation warning about a module, which is a standard practice. No suspicious or unusual code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and shapely, then issues a DeprecationWarning regarding the 'shapely.geos' module, informing users about deprecation and future removal. It then assigns version information from shapely's geos-related attributes to local variables. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious activity. The warning and variable assignments are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module providing deprecation notices and version info for shapely's GEOS features. There is no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks identified.",
