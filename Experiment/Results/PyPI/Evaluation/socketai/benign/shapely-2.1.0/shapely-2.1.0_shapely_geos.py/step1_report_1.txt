{
  "purpose": "Provide proxies for libgeos, handle GEOS-specific exceptions, and utility functions related to shapely's geos capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reads from shapely.geos_capi_version_string, shapely.geos_version, shapely.geos_capi_version",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security issues are present",
  "flows": "The code accesses shapely module attributes and assigns them to local variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily issues a deprecation warning; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports warnings and shapely, then issues a deprecation warning about 'shapely.geos' module being deprecated. It then assigns three shapely geos-related attributes to local variables. There are no inputs from external sources, no processing of untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The code's purpose appears solely to handle deprecation notices and expose version information.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple deprecation warning and exposes version information about GEOS via shapely. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
