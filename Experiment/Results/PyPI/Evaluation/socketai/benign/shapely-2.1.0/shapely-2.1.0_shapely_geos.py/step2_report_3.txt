  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is straightforward: it imports warnings and shapely, issues a deprecation warning about 'shapely.geos', and assigns version-related attributes from shapely to local variables.\n- No external inputs, no data processing, no network calls, no dynamic code execution.\n- The purpose is purely informational and to warn users about deprecation.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code **does not** contain any malicious code, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The deprecation warning is standard practice and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- The version attributes are read-only and pose no security risk.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code's purpose is clear, and the operations are safe.\n- The deprecation warning indicates ongoing maintenance, not malicious activity.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, as no security issues are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0 or 0.5, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The only point to consider is whether the deprecation warning could cause confusion or disruption, but that does not impact security.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted; the code is purely utility and informational.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minor deprecation warnings, but 0 is fine)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate. The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple utility module issuing a deprecation warning and exposing version info. It presents no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified and should remain as is.",
