{
  "purpose": "This code provides proxies and utility functions related to the GEOS geometry engine in the shapely library, and issues a deprecation warning regarding the 'shapely.geos' module.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'shapely.geos_capi_version_string', 'shapely.geos_version', and 'shapely.geos_capi_version' attributes from the shapely library.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data or executes external commands. The only output is a deprecation warning message.",
  "flows": "Reading attribute values from the shapely library (sources) triggers a warning (sink), but no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident. The code uses standard library functions and attributes, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the warnings and shapely modules, then issues a deprecation warning about the 'shapely.geos' module, which is a benign operation intended to inform users of future changes. It then retrieves version information from the shapely.geos module. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, no execution of untrusted code, and no suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, focusing on deprecation notification and attribute access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility module that informs users about deprecation and exposes version info. There is no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It is a benign code snippet with standard operations.",
