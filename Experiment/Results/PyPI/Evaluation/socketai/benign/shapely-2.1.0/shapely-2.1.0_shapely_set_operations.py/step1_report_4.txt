  "purpose": "Provides set-theoretic operations on geometry objects, including union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, and specialized optimized unions, for use with shapely geometries.",
  "sources": "Input geometries passed to functions such as difference, intersection, symmetric_difference, union, union_all, coverage_union, coverage_union_all, disjoint_subset_union, disjoint_subset_union_all.",
  "sinks": "Lib functions such as difference_prec, intersection_prec, symmetric_difference_prec, union_prec, unary_union_prec, coverage_union, disjoint_subset_union, disjoint_subset_union_all, which perform geometric computations; potential data leaks if input geometries are maliciously constructed. No evidence of data leakage or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input geometries are processed directly from parameters; in functions with grid_size, data is passed to lib.*_prec functions that perform coordinate snapping and geometric calculations. Geometry collections are constructed for batch operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no backdoors or unusual code patterns. Use of deprecated warnings indicates ongoing API changes but no malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names. Use of numpy and shapely lib functions appears standard for geometric processing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines geometric set operations using shapely and GEOS libraries, with some functions offering optimized performance assumptions. Use of decorators for deprecation warnings, multithreading, and GEOS version requirements appears standard. No network calls, data exfiltration, or code that manipulates environment variables or sensitive data. The presence of deprecated warnings indicates ongoing API evolution but does not imply malicious intent. No obfuscated or hidden code, and all library calls are well-documented functions. The code does not perform any system modifications, external communications, or access to sensitive data. The only potential concern is if geometries are constructed maliciously to cause performance issues, but this is standard for geometric libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of geometric operations with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It adheres to expected patterns for a geometry processing library, with no evidence of security risks beyond normal computational resource considerations. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful actions are present.",
