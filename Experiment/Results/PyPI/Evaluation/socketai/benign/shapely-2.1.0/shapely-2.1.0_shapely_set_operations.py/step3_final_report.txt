{
  "purpose": "Provides geometric set operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, coverage union, disjoint subset unions) wrapping shapely lib functions with validation and deprecation handling.",
  "sources": "Input geometries, parameters like grid_size and axis, which are passed to trusted lib functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to shapely's lib functions such as difference_prec, union_prec, etc., with data processed internally; no external system or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into lib functions; no external data leaks or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Deprecation warnings and known issues are documented as standard maintenance signals.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured wrapper around shapely's core geometry functions, with appropriate validation, deprecation warnings, and parameter handling. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The lib functions are trusted components of shapely, and the code does not perform any external communication or system modification. The only noted concern is resource exhaustion potential if malicious geometries are supplied, which is a known limitation of geometry processing libraries, not an attack vector. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The supply chain security risk for this code is negligible. It is a standard, trusted wrapper around shapely's geometry functions, with no malicious or sabotage signals. The low risk score is justified, and malware/obfuscated scores should remain at zero.",
