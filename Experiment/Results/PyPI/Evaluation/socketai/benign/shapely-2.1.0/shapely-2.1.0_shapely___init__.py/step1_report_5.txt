{
  "purpose": "The code is intended for manipulation and analysis of geometric objects in the Cartesian plane using the Shapely library.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and submodules from the shapely library, which are used for geometric computations and object creation.",
  "sinks": "No identifiable sinks; the code does not include data output, network communication, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets up environment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. All imports are from the open-source shapely library; nothing indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple components from the shapely library, including core geometry classes and submodules. It also sets up signal checks via a function call. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted inputs. The imports are standard for a geometry processing project, and no obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for a geometry processing application using the shapely library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and benign.",
