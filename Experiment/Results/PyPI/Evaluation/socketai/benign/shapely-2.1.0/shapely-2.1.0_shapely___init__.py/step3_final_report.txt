  "purpose": "Initialize and set up the shapely geometry library environment by importing core modules and registering geometry subclasses.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from shapely submodules and the call to setup_signal_checks()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are processed or generated",
  "flows": "Imports and setup function are executed sequentially; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static imports and a legitimate setup call",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for the shapely library, importing core geometry classes and submodules, and calling setup_signal_checks() for internal safety. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The imports are static and from a well-known open-source library, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected. The call to setup_signal_checks() is a standard safety measure, not malicious. All indicators point to benign, standard library initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs standard imports and initialization for the shapely geometry library, posing no threat.",
