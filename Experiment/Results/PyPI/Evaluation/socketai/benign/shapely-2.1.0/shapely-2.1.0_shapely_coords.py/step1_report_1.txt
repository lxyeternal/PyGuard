{
  "purpose": "Utility class for accessing and manipulating coordinate sequences, mainly for geometric operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'coords' array provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources or perform any network or file I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the '_coords' array through various methods, but there are no untrusted data sinks such as network calls or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious imports or dynamic code execution. The class primarily performs data access and conversion operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for coordinate sequence handling, with methods for length, iteration, indexing, array conversion, and extraction of x and y coordinates. It performs standard data access and array manipulations using the 'array' module. No suspicious patterns, hidden behavior, or malicious code are present. The implementation is consistent with typical geometric data handling. No external data sources, no network activity, or file I/O are present. The code does not perform any insecure operations, SQL injections, or code injections.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward utility class for coordinate data handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard implementation with no suspicious behavior.",
