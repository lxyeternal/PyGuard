{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for accessing and manipulating coordinate sequences from geometries, including iteration, slicing, conversion to array, and extraction of XY components.",
  "sources": "Initial input: the 'coords' array passed to the constructor. Accesses to self._coords throughout the class.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or output operations, such as network communication, file writing, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from constructor parameter to internal _coords attribute; data is read in methods (__len__, __iter__, __getitem__, __array__, xy property) without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Use of standard array operations and data encapsulation appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The class mainly handles data access and conversion functions for coordinate sequences, with no external calls or data leaks. No indications of malicious intent such as code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The code does not perform any I/O operations beyond internal data handling, nor does it invoke system commands or external services. No obfuscation techniques or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility class for coordinate sequence management with no malicious or suspicious features. It is safe and does not pose security risks based on its current implementation.",
