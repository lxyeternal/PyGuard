{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities to access and manipulate coordinate sequences from geometric objects, primarily for spatial data handling.",
  "sources": "Reads coordinate array (`self._coords`) from input parameters during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Returns coordinate data in various formats, including arrays and tuples; no data is sent externally or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Reads coordinate data from `self._coords`; outputs coordinate data via properties and methods, with no external data flows or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward data handling and array manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The class wraps an array of coordinates, providing iteration, indexing, slicing, conversion to array, and extraction of x/y components. It includes input validation for index bounds and type checks. No external data input, no code injection, or suspicious data flow observed. The code does not include network operations, file manipulations, or environmental variable usage. Overall, it is a utility class for coordinate management without malicious intent or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for coordinate data handling, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
