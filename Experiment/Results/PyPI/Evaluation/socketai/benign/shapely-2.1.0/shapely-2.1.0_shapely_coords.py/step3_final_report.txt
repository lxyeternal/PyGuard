  "purpose": "Utility class for managing coordinate sequences, providing access, iteration, slicing, and conversion functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads coordinate data from the internal '_coords' array during iteration, indexing, slicing, and property access.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; no network, file, or system output involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the '_coords' array through methods like __getitem__, __iter__, and xy property to the user or calling functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with standard Python constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured utility class that manages coordinate data stored in an array. It performs standard operations such as length retrieval, iteration, indexing, slicing, and conversion to array, with proper bounds checking and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not perform any external I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The logic is correct, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility class for coordinate sequence management. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The existing analysis and scores are accurate and justified.",
