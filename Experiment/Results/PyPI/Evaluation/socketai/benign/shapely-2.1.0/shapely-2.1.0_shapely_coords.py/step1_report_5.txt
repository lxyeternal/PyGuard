  "purpose": "Utility class for handling coordinate sequences, providing access, iteration, slicing, and array conversion features for coordinate data.",
  "sources": "Initialization with 'coords' array, and property/method accesses such as __len__, __iter__, __getitem__, __array__, and xy property.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no external data being sent or written to untrusted sources. No network, file, or environment variable usage observed.",
  "flows": "Input source is the 'coords' array provided during initialization; data flows through methods like __getitem__, __iter__, __array__, and xy to output coordinate data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard data access and array handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward utility class for coordinate sequence management. It uses standard Python features, including array handling, iteration, and property access. No external data sources, network calls, or potentially malicious logic are present. The class strictly handles data within provided coordinate arrays without executing or evaluating any untrusted inputs or code. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the consistent copying of data for safety, but this is standard and not suspicious. Overall, the code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility class for coordinate data management with no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks identified. It performs safe data handling and access without external communication or security-sensitive operations.",
