  "purpose": "Store metadata information about the package such as copyright, license, and version.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string literals to special metadata variables (__copyright__, __license__, __version__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs are present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of metadata variable assignments. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns static string literals to special module-level variables that typically describe package metadata. There are no dynamic operations, external data reads, or potentially malicious code components present. This is a common pattern in Python packages for metadata declaration. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are identified in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless and only provides package metadata information. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
