  "purpose": "Define metadata about the Python package such as copyright, license, and version.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply assigning metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; only metadata assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains static string assignments for package metadata, which is common in Python modules. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious activity. The code does not contain any embedded logic, input handling, or external communication. It appears to be part of a larger package's __init__.py or metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata declarations for a Python package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
