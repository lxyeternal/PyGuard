  "purpose": "This code declares package metadata variables (__copyright__, __license__, __version__) for a Python module.",
  "sources": "Static assignments to module-level variables (__copyright__, __license__, __version__)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present",
  "flows": "None; static data assignments without data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static variable assignments with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for package metadata, with no functions, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify it as benign. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. Confidence is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code and the thorough assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as standard package metadata with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
