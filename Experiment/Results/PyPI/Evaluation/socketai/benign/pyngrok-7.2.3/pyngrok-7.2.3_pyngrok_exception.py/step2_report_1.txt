  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The provided code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the pyngrok library.\n- These classes include general errors, security errors, installation errors, and specific HTTP and URL errors.\n- The classes are standard, inheriting from Python's Exception or a custom base, with attributes to store error details.\n- There are no external inputs, no network or file operations, and no code obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code is purely class definitions for error handling. No logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.  \n  **Conclusion:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n\n- **Malware or suspicious behavior:**  \n  The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or code execution. It only defines exception classes.  \n  **Conclusion:** Malware score should be 0.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious language features.  \n  **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should be 0.\n\n- **Security risks:**  \n  No hardcoded secrets, external data leaks, or backdoors. Exception classes are standard.  \n  **Conclusion:** Security risk score should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the report scores:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are all 1.0, which is appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n- The conclusions in all reports are consistent: the code is standard, non-malicious, and purely structural.\n\n### Any discrepancies or issues?\n- **Potential overestimation of risk scores?**  \n  No, since the code is non-malicious and purely structural, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThe code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and straightforward.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at **0**. The code is legitimate and poses no security threat.",
