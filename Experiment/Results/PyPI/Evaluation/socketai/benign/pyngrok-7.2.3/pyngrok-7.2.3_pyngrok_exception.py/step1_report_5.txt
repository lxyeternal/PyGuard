{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the pyngrok library, including general errors, security errors, and specific HTTP or URL errors related to ngrok interactions.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read directly in this code; it primarily defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; the code only raises and stores error information.",
  "flows": "Error objects are instantiated with error details; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code strictly defines error classes without external input processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and PyngrokError. The constructors accept error messages, logs, URLs, status codes, headers, body content, and reasons, storing them as class attributes. There is no input/output handling, network communication, or code execution. The classes are designed for structured error reporting. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to serve as part of a larger, security-conscious error management system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling in the pyngrok library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The design is straightforward and intended for capturing error details during ngrok interactions.",
