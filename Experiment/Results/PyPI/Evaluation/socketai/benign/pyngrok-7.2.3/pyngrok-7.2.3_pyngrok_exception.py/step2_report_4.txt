  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently conclude that the code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling within the pyngrok library.\n- No external input sources, data processing, or external communication are involved.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code uses standard class inheritance and exception handling mechanisms.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.\n- The purpose is to facilitate structured error reporting and debugging.\n\n**Code Confirmations:**\n- The code only defines custom exception classes with attributes to store error details.\n- The constructors initialize these attributes with provided parameters.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation.\n- The classes inherit from Python's Exception hierarchy, which is standard practice.\n\n**Error in the Report Logic or Reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is non-malicious and purely structural.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — No malicious intent, code, or behavior detected.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — No security risk is present in this static code.\n\n**Potential Risks or Concerns:**\n- Since the code is only class definitions, it inherently carries no runtime risk.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n- The detailed error attributes could, in theory, be misused if combined with untrusted data elsewhere, but within this snippet, there's no evidence of such.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is standard, well-structured exception handling classes.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores should remain at 0.0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — No malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — Clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — No security risks in this static code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard for error handling, and contains no security concerns or malicious elements.",
