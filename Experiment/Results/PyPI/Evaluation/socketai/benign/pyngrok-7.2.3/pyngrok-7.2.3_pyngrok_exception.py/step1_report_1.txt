  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the pyngrok library, including security-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are directly read; the code primarily defines error classes.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external communication is performed in this code segment.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present; the code only defines classes and their attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses standard class inheritance and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains class definitions for exception handling related to the pyngrok library. There are no data inputs, external interactions, or suspicious behaviors. The classes include attributes for debugging and error information, which are standard for exception handling. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, legitimate code for a Python library.",
