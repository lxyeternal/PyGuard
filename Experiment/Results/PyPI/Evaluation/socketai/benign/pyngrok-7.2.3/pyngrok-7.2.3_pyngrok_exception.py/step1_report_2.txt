  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the pyngrok library, including general, security, installation, and various HTTP errors.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code defines exception classes and their initialization methods.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising and handling; no direct data leaks, code execution, or external data transmission are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code solely defines classes; no runtime data flow occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; the code is straightforward class definitions without dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of exception classes to manage errors related to ngrok interactions. It includes detailed error information storage, such as logs and request data. There are no hardcoded credentials, external data processing, or potentially malicious constructs. The classes are standard and intended for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions for error management within the pyngrok library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and does not introduce security risks.",
