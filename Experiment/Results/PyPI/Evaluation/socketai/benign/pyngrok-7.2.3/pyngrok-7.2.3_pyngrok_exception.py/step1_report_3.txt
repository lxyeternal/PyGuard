{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the pyngrok library, including specific errors related to ngrok process interactions and HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; primarily class definitions and exception initializations.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling and message passing within the application; no external data sinks or untrusted data flows evident.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exception objects are constructed with input data but do not process external data maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Exception classes are standard, with no suspicious behaviors or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and typical for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions used in pyngrok, with no input/output handling, network activity, or external data processing. All classes inherit from Python's Exception and initialize with message parameters. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. The code appears to be standard error handling infrastructure, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard error class definitions for a Python library, with no malicious or security-threatening elements. It simply facilitates structured exception handling without exposing or mishandling sensitive data.",
