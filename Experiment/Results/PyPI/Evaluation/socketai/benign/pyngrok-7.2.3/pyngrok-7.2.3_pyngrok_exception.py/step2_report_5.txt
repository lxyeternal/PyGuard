  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Malware:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - There are no signs of code execution, data exfiltration, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - The classes are straightforward, intended for error handling, with attributes to store debugging information.\n\n2. **Code Functionality and Logic:**\n   - The code defines exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception or a custom base class.\n   - The constructors initialize attributes with provided parameters, which is standard practice.\n   - No external input sources, network activity, or data processing occurs within this snippet.\n   - The code is purely structural, facilitating error reporting in the larger pyngrok library.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the straightforward, readable class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which aligns with the absence of security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Anomalies:**\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or code patterns are observed.\n   - The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception class definitions.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is legitimate, intended for error handling within the pyngrok library.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious intent, security risk, or obfuscation.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n| Metric             | Score (original) | Justification / Suggested Change                        |\n|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0.0              | Correct; no malicious activity detected.             |\n| Obfuscated         | 0.0              | Correct; code is clear and straightforward.          |\n| Risk               | 0.0              | Correct; no security risks identified.               |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and purely structural.** No adjustments to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is typical infrastructure code for error handling, with no security risks or obfuscation.",
