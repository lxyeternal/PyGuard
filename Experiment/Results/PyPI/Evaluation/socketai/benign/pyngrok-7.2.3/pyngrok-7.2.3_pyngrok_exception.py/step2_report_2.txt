  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Review & Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to the pyngrok library.\n   - There are no external data inputs, network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.\n   - The attributes stored within exception classes are standard for debugging and error reporting.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.\n   - They accurately note the absence of data leaks, external data processing, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws or inconsistencies are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The high confidence scores (1.0) are justified given the straightforward, non-malicious structure.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are zero.\n   - Given the code's purpose (error class definitions), this is appropriate.\n   - No justification for higher scores exists here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing untrusted code, exfiltrating data, or embedding malware.\n   - The malware score of 0 is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's static structure.\n   - They correctly conclude that no suspicious or malicious behavior is present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — The code is clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception class definitions for error handling in a Python library.\n- It serves a purely structural and debugging purpose without any malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Conclusion**: The overall evaluation confirms that this code is benign, with no security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
