  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the pyngrok library, including general, security, installation, HTTP, and URL errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only initializes class attributes via constructors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external sources or sinks; the code solely defines class structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception hierarchy, with attributes for error details. No network, file, or dynamic code execution occurs. The classes serve as structured error containers. The code is static, well-structured, and standard for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and intended for error reporting. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
