  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, malware potential, and overall risk scores based on the provided code.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No external input, network communication, or data processing occurs within this snippet.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- Exception classes include attributes for debugging and error context, which is standard practice.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger, error-handling framework for the pyngrok library.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define custom exception classes, including security errors.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, no malicious behavior, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both at 0.0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Define exception classes for general, security, install, and HTTP errors.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious logic, no external data handling, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Both at 0.0 are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes for ngrok process interactions and HTTP errors.\n- **Analysis:** Standard class definitions, no signs of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Both at 0.0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes for errors during ngrok API requests.\n- **Analysis:** No external data processing or malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** Both at 0.0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Define exception classes for various ngrok errors.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous reports; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Both at 0.0 are suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, defining exception classes.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The attributes stored in exceptions are typical for debugging and error reporting.\n- The code does not process external data or perform any network or file operations.\n\n### **Overall Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — standard error handling code with no security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification**\nGiven the analysis, the code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes used for error handling in a Python library. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
