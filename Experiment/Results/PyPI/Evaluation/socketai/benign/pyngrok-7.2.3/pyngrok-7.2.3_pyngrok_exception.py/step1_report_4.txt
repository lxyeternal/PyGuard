{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the pyngrok library, including specific errors related to ngrok interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters passed during exception initialization (e.g., error messages, logs, headers, reason). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted data beyond internal exception messaging. No network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow paths are evident; the code mainly defines error classes without processing or transferring untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward class definitions with no unusual language features, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes to handle errors in the pyngrok library, with detailed attributes to capture error specifics. There are no signs of malicious logic, data leaks, or suspicious data handling. The absence of external data sources, network operations, or code execution routines indicates a focus on error reporting rather than active data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling within a Python library, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
