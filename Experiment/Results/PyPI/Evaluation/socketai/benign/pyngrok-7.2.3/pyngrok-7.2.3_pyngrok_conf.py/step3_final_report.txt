  "purpose": "Configuration management for the pyngrok package, handling paths, environment variables, and startup parameters for ngrok.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (NGROK_AUTHTOKEN, NGROK_API_KEY), OS-based path construction, import statements.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network calls, or external data transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Reading environment variables for tokens; constructing system-specific config paths; setting configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration handler for pyngrok, managing paths based on OS, reading tokens from environment variables, and defining a configuration class with various parameters. It does not perform any network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The environment variables are used as intended for credentials, and the path logic is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration management module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable usage is standard and not indicative of malicious activity. The scores and assessments across reports are justified and accurate.",
