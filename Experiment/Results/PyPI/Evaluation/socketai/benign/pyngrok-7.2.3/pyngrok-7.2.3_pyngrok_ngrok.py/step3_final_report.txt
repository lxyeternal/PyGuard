{
  "purpose": "The code manages ngrok installation, configuration, process control, and API interactions for tunnel management.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, environment variables, and network responses from ngrok API endpoints; executes system commands for process control.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to ngrok API endpoints; subprocess calls to start/stop ngrok processes.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (config/env variables) lead to API requests and process commands; responses update tunnel states and metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected; code follows standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate tasks related to ngrok management, including installation, configuration, API communication, and process control. It validates URLs, handles errors properly, and does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors. Network requests are to trusted ngrok API endpoints, and process management uses standard libraries. No signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior are present. The code is clear, readable, and adheres to best practices, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure management interface for ngrok, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. It operates within expected parameters for such tools, and the risk of malicious behavior is negligible.",
