  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup utility for ngrok, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The static CDN URLs are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to reliance on external binaries without integrity verification. Overall, it is a safe and standard utility for managing ngrok binaries and configurations."
