  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the details provided.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code handles downloading, installing, and configuring ngrok binaries across platforms.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The URLs used for downloading are static CDN links for ngrok, which are legitimate and publicly accessible.\n- The code performs standard validation, error handling, and system detection.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident.\n- The malware scores are all 0, and confidence levels are high (0.9+), indicating the reviewers believe the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Concerns:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, with no hidden or obfuscated logic, no code injection, or suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Are the URLs trustworthy?**  \n  The URLs are from official CDN sources for ngrok, which are standard for such tools. No dynamic URL generation from untrusted sources.\n\n- **Does the code handle sensitive data?**  \n  No credentials or secrets are embedded. Configuration validation restricts some options but does not introduce security risks.\n\n- **Is there any malicious behavior?**  \n  No. The download, extraction, and permission setting are typical for installer scripts.\n\n- **Are there any anomalies?**  \n  Slightly, the code could benefit from integrity checks (e.g., hashes) on downloads, but this is not a security flaw per se.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score (all 0):**  \n  Correct. No malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (all 0):**  \n  Correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Very low (0.1–0.2). The only minor concern is static URLs without integrity verification, but this does not constitute malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the detailed review, the code is a legitimate utility for managing ngrok binaries and configurations. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The static URLs are standard CDN links for ngrok, and the code performs expected tasks securely.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly related to external dependencies without integrity checks)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The code is a typical setup utility with no signs of malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores reflect its benign nature.",
