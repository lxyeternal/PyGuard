{
  "purpose": "The code manages downloading, installing, and configuring ngrok binaries across multiple platforms, ensuring proper setup and validation.",
  "sources": "URLs for binary downloads, filesystem for config files, environment detection for platform-specific operations.",
  "sinks": "File writes for downloads and configs, permission setting on binaries, network requests to CDN URLs.",
  "flows": "Download URL validation -> file download -> extraction -> permission setting -> config validation -> config writing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity; static CDN URLs are used for binaries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for managing ngrok binaries and configs. It validates URLs, handles platform detection, and manages files securely. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The static CDN URLs are from trusted sources, and validation functions restrict unsafe configurations. The download function includes retries and progress reporting, typical for such utilities. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup utility for ngrok, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The static CDN URLs are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to reliance on external binaries without integrity verification. Overall, it is a safe and standard utility for managing ngrok binaries and configurations.",
