  "purpose": "This code manages the lifecycle of the ngrok process, including starting, stopping, configuring, and monitoring ngrok tunnels and processes.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files (YAML), environment variables, and subprocess outputs from ngrok processes.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocess commands to control ngrok, reads process output streams, makes HTTP requests to ngrok API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Configuration and commands are passed to subprocesses, process logs are parsed, HTTP requests are made to localhost API endpoints, process status is checked and managed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no unusual or malicious code patterns observed. Uses standard process control and logging practices. No suspicious network addresses or data leaks evident.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard patterns for managing external subprocesses, with appropriate validation and error handling. It reads logs from ngrok processes to determine health and state, makes HTTP requests to localhost API endpoints for health checks, and manages process lifecycle including starting, stopping, and cleanup. No malicious or suspicious activities, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The subprocess commands and logs appear consistent with normal ngrok process management. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no code suggesting malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for managing ngrok processes with proper validation and process control. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks within this code snippet.",
