  "anomalies": "Use of setattr() on untrusted input; normalization of log levels",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class NgrokLog that parses a log line into attributes. It uses shlex.split() to tokenize the input, then extracts key-value pairs where '=' is present. It normalizes the 'lvl' attribute to standard logging levels, handling common abbreviations. Attributes like msg, err, obj, addr, t are set based on the parsed data. No external system calls, network activity, or code execution occurs. The use of setattr() on data from logs is controlled, as only predefined attribute names are used. The code is straightforward, with error handling for parsing issues. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The normalization of log levels and attribute setting are standard practices. Overall, the code appears benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward log parser with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
