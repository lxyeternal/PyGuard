  "purpose": "Parse and structure log lines from the ngrok process for easier analysis and handling.",
  "sources": "The input log line provided to the constructor (__init__ method).",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the attribute setting with setattr, which could modify object attributes based on parsed input.",
  "flows": "Input log line -> shlex.split parsing -> key-value extraction -> setattr on object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious commands. Use of shlex.split on log line is standard. No dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on parsing log lines. It safely splits input using shlex, handles key-value pairs, and normalizes log levels. There is no indication of malicious code, external data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The attribute setting is based solely on the parsed log line, with no external or untrusted code execution. The use of 'hasattr' to validate log levels is safe and standard. No obfuscation or malware patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward log parser with no malicious intent. It processes input safely and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
