  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code sets up an SDK interface for AWS vpc-lattice, with example usage.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or data sinks beyond the API calls, which are standard SDK interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately concludes that the code is standard SDK setup with minimal security risk.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, just SDK setup)  \n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes that it provides a structured SDK interface with documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states this is a typical SDK interface module with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (no security concern)  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes standard SDK setup, importing classes, and creating a client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or data sinks; only object creation.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies this as benign SDK code.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Well justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that it sets up SDK components.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing or network activity beyond SDK calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes this as a standard SDK wrapper.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes that the code initializes SDK clients and paginators.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The only potential concern is the use of `client.get_paginator` with hardcoded strings, which is standard.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual aspect is the future-dated license year (2025), but this is not suspicious per se.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is boilerplate SDK setup with no malicious intent.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, as none of the reports identify malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1 or 0), justified by the nature of the code being SDK setup.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes needed; all assessments are reasonable.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (minimal, just SDK setup, no sensitive data or network activity beyond standard API calls)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign SDK interface module with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
