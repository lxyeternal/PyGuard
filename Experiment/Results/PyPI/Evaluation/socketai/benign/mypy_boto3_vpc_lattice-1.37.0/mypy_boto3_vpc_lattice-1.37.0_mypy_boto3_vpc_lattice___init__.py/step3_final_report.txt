{
  "purpose": "Setup and interface for AWS vpc-lattice SDK, including client creation and paginator initialization.",
  "sources": "Imports of SDK modules, session creation, and client instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external network calls; only SDK method calls for paginator setup.",
  "flows": "Initialization flows from SDK import to client creation and paginator setup; no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns; license year 2025 is unusual but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward SDK boilerplate for AWS vpc-lattice, involving imports, session, client, and paginator setup. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity beyond SDK calls. The license year 2025 is noted but not malicious. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK setup with no malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate a safe, well-structured module.",
