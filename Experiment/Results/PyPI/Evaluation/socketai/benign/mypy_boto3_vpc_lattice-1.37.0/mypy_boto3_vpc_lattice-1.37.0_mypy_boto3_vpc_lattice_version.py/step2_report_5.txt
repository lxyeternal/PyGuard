  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and verify the code's security implications step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Content Verification:**  \nThe code is a straightforward version declaration:\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\nIt assigns a static string to `__version__`, with a comment and a copyright notice. There are no imports, no dynamic code execution, no input handling, no external data sources, and no obfuscation.\n\n**2. Logical and Reasoning Review of Each Report:**  \n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple version string assignment.  \n- The comments and copyright notice are benign.  \n- The only notable anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming current date is before 2025). This might suggest an oversight or outdated information but does not impact security.\n\n**3. Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**  \n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's simplicity.  \n- The malware score should remain 0, as there is no malicious activity or code.\n\n**4. Security Risk Assessment:**  \n- The reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.  \n- No external effects, data flows, or potential vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**5. Potential Issues or Assumptions:**  \n- The only questionable point is the copyright year \"2025.\"  \n- This is an inconsistency but not a security concern.  \n- No claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions are made.\n\n**6. Score Justification and Consistency:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.  \n- No changes are necessary unless future context suggests otherwise.\n\n**7. Final Personal Assessment:**  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.1 (a very minor concern about the future copyright year, but not a security issue)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Recommendations:**  \n- Keep the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0 or very close to 0.  \n- No need to flag this as malicious or risky.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the future copyright year, but negligible)\n\nThis thorough review confirms the code is safe and straightforward.",
