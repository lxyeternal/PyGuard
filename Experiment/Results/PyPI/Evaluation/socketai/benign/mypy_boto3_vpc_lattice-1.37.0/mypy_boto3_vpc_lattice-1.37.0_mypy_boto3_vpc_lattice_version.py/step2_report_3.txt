  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward version assignment.\n- No suspicious code, external data handling, or obfuscation is detected.\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year \"2025\" in report 3, which is in the future and could suggest outdated or incorrect metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code simply assigns a string to `__version__`. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- No code execution, input handling, or external data flows are involved.\n- The only notable point is the future copyright year \"2025\" in report 3, which is likely a typo or oversight, but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, reasoning, or mistakes in the reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only potential oversight is in report 3, where the future copyright year is flagged as anomalous. While this is an inconsistency, it doesn't constitute a security risk or malicious behavior.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound and consistent.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The securityRisk scores are also 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n- Confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n**Any adjustments?**\n- For report 3, the anomaly (future year) could be noted as a minor metadata inconsistency but not a security concern. Its confidence is slightly lower (0.9), which makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified.\n- Malware score is 0 across the board, consistent with no malicious code.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n### Consistency check:\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not a security issue.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
