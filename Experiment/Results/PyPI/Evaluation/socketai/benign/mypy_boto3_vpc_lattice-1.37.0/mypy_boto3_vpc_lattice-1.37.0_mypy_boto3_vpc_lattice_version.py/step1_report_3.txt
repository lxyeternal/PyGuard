  "purpose": "Define the version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string '__version__' with a hardcoded value.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright year '2025' that is in the future, which may indicate outdated or incorrect metadata. No malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to the variable '__version__'. The only notable aspect is the copyright date '2025', which is inconsistent with current or past dates and may suggest an error or oversight. No input handling, no suspicious code, and no external calls are present. The code is straightforward and typical for package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version declaration with an anomalous copyright year. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified.",
