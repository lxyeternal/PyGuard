  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code in question is a straightforward version assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"` with a comment indicating the source of truth.\n- No input/output, dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- All reports correctly identify this as benign, standard boilerplate code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None detected.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year \"2025\" in some reports, which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming current date is before 2025). This is likely a typo or oversight, not malicious.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n1. **Scores Consistency:**\n   - All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is correct.\n   - The `malware` scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, matching the straightforward code.\n\n2. **Potential for Re-evaluation:**\n   - The only minor point is the one report mentioning the future copyright year (\"2025\"). While not malicious, it might be worth noting as an inconsistency or typo, but it doesn't impact security scoring.\n\n3. **Risk Scores:**\n   - Since there's no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code, a risk score of 0 for all reports is appropriate.\n   - The reports' conclusions align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. All scores and conclusions are appropriate. The only minor note is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings.",
