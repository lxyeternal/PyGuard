  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review**:\n   - The code is a straightforward assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`.\n   - It contains only a comment about the source of truth and a copyright notice.\n   - There are no imports, no data processing, no external calls, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation.\n   - The version string appears static and standard.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign and standard for version declaration.\n   - The only notable anomaly is the copyright year \"2025\" (from report 3), which is in the future and could indicate an oversight, but it does not pose a security risk.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No logical errors or misjudgments are evident.\n   - The comments about potential future date are reasonable but do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No report suggests any malicious or obfuscated behavior that warrants raising scores.\n\n5. **Potential for Malicious Behavior**:\n   - There is no evidence of malicious intent.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious operations.\n   - The only concern is the future copyright year, which is not malicious but might be a typo or oversight.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a boilerplate version declaration.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware Score**: Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score**: Keep at 0, as there's no security concern.\n- **Note**: The only minor point is the future copyright year, which could be corrected but does not impact security.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThe code is perfectly benign, and the existing scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
