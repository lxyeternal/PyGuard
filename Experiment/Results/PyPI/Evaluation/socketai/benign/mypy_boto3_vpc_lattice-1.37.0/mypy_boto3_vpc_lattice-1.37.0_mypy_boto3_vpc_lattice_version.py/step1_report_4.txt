  "purpose": "Define the version string for the package or module",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable to a string",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "The version string assignment is straightforward with no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version assignment, normal copyright comment",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a comment, a copyright notice, and a variable assignment setting __version__ to a static string. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external calls, or suspicious constructs. The version string appears valid and static. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a standard pattern used in Python packages for version tracking.",
