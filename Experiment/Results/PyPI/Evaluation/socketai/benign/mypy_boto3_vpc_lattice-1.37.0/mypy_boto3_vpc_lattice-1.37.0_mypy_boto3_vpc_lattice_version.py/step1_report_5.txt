{
  "purpose": "Defines the version of the module or package",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string (__version__ = \"1.37.0\")",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or external data sinks",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow beyond defining a variable",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; straightforward version assignment with no suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code sets a module-level variable __version__ to a static string '1.37.0'. It contains a comment about source of truth and copyright information. There are no inputs, external data reads, or potentially unsafe operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious code segments. It is a standard practice for versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It appears to be boilerplate version info.",
