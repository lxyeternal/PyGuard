  "purpose": "Defines the source of truth for the software version with a static string assignment.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = \"1.37.0\"; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the copyright year \"2025\" which is in the future; this is likely a typo or oversight, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string with a comment. No imports, dynamic code, or external data handling are present. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The only minor inconsistency is the future copyright year, which does not pose a security risk. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
