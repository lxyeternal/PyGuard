{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-vpc-lattice package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, imports setup from setuptools, and reads environment variables via package requirements (indirectly).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling, network, or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "The code reads local files and package metadata; no external data flows or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration. It reads a local markdown file for description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic code executions, no network connections, and no handling of untrusted data. All dependencies and URLs appear legitimate. The code structure and content align with common setup scripts, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign, standard, and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious activity. It solely defines package configuration for distribution.",
