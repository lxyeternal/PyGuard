  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward setup.py script.\n- It reads a local README.md file for long_description.\n- It imports `setuptools.setup` and calls it with static, predefined metadata.\n- No user input, environment variables (except for the minimal `python_requires` and `install_requires`), or dynamic code execution.\n- No network operations, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree on benignity, with confidence at 1 and malware scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as a typical setup script. No issues are present.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, justified by the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as no vulnerabilities or security issues are identified.\n\n### Potential points of contention:\n- The reports mention reading the README.md file and static configuration, which is standard.\n- No external input or untrusted data is processed.\n- No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` for packaging a Python library.\n- All metadata and dependencies are hardcoded or read from local files.\n- No dynamic or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**All reports are consistent and accurate.** No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is benign, standard, and free of malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The scores reflect this accurately.",
