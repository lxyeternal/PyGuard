  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python library 'mypy-boto3-vpc-lattice'.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file; static package metadata and configuration within setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Static data used for package configuration; no dynamic or source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script importing setuptools and reading a local README for description. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling. All metadata and dependencies are hardcoded. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. Multiple reviews confirm its benign nature, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence in these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are accurate and justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
