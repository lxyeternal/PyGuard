{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-vpc-lattice package, used for package installation and metadata specification.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; importing setuptools for setup; hardcoded package data, version, author info, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe sinks identified; no execution of untrusted input or network operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows that could lead to security issues. The script mainly reads local files and defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: reading a markdown file for description, importing setup tools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and project URLs. All data appears static, safe, and typical for Python package setup scripts. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies without executing any untrusted code or performing network operations.",
