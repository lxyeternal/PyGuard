  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging, with no dynamic input, no network operations, no code obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for the long description, imports setuptools, and calls setup() with static metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Flow and sinks:** No untrusted data flows or sinks are present.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies such as obfuscation, secrets, or dynamic code.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code is straightforward and typical for a `setup.py` script.\n- No external inputs or dynamic behaviors are involved.\n- All data is static and predefined.\n- No signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (or 0)\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign and standard for package setup.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a clean, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
