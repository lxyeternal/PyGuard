  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the presence of issues, logical soundness, and the accuracy of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS resource identifiers, with no external data handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** The code is static, uses standard practices, and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report correctly identifies this as a benign static declaration module with high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct, no malicious activity detected.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- Risk: 0 — no security risk.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining literals for AWS VPC Lattice and related constants, with no data flow.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard static definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states that the code is benign, intended for type safety.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0 — no security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for AWS resource identifiers, no external data handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as benign static type annotations.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward code.  \n- Risk: 0 — no security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions, with license notice and version check.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is a benign set of type definitions.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0 — no security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines static literals for AWS VPC Lattice, with compatibility handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly classifies this as a safe static type declaration.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n- Risk: 0 — no security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and intended for type safety.\n- **Malware, obfuscated, or security risks:** All scores are correctly set to zero.\n- **Any inconsistencies:** None observed; all reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a well-structured, benign set of static type annotations for AWS resource identifiers, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports' evaluations are accurate and aligned with the code's nature.",
