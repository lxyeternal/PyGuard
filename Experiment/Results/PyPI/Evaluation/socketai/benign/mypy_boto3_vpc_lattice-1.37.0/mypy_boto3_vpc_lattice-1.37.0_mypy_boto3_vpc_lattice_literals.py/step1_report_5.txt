  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS VPC Lattice service literals using Python typing for enhanced static type checking.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for various string-based types and constants, imported modules (sys, typing, typing_extensions).",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs; static type definitions only.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code consists solely of type alias declarations and a version check for import compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type aliases for string literals, intended to improve type safety when interacting with AWS SDKs. It uses conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions. There are no data processing, network operations, or external interactions present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or dynamic code execution. The purpose aligns with documentation and type hinting, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions for AWS VPC Lattice service literals, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves as a static typing aid without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
