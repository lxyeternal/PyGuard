  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS VPC Lattice service literals for use with boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Static type annotations defined as Literal types; no external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points identified; code is purely type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is solely type annotations for static analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code includes a license notice and version check for importing 'Literal'.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a series of string literal types for AWS service identifiers, regions, and resource types, enabling strict type checking with Python's typing system. The version check for importing 'Literal' indicates compatibility handling. No runtime data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The license and documentation comments are benign and standard for open-source type stubs. There are no signs of malicious code or sabotage, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type definitions intended for static type checking of AWS SDK interactions. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a safe and well-structured module for type annotations, with no indications of obfuscation or malware.",
