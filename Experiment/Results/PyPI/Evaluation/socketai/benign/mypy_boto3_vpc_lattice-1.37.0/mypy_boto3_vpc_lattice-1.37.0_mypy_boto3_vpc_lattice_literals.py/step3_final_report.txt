  "purpose": "Static type annotations defining string literal types for AWS resource identifiers, service names, regions, and related constants to ensure type safety and documentation clarity.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals within the module; no external data input or dynamic data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Purely static definitions; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard static type declaration patterns, conditional imports, and no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static type alias definitions using Literal for AWS resource names, service names, regions, and other constants. It includes version-dependent import handling for 'Literal'. The code is straightforward, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The purpose is to provide type safety and documentation support, with all signals indicating benign static definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type annotations for AWS resource identifiers. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and high confidence are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
