{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS VPC Lattice and related service constants to ensure type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for string constants, import statements for 'sys' and 'typing' modules, conditional import of 'Literal'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs; code is purely type annotation definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "N/A; static type definitions with no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and only defines type literals and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to check the Python version and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then declares numerous string literal types representing AWS service constants, regions, and other identifiers. There are no external inputs, user data handling, or dynamic code execution. All definitions are static and serve as type annotations to improve code safety and clarity. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of type alias definitions for AWS service literals. It appears to be part of a type stub library intended for static type checking with no malicious intent or security issues.",
