{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations using Python's Literal for various AWS resource and service identifiers, likely for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing; string literals for type annotations; assignment of Literal types to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external outputs, or data leaks; no network or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily consists of static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. Use of conditional import for compatibility is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python practices to define a series of Literal type aliases for AWS resource names, regions, and other identifiers. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity is present. The initial conditional import for typing.Literal based on Python version is a common compatibility pattern. The file appears solely as a static type definitions module with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign static definitions module providing type annotations for AWS service identifiers. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, nor does it pose security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
