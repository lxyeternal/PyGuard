  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS resource and service identifiers for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotation definitions, and literal string lists for resource names, service names, and region names.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines constants and type annotations without any data processing, output, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink since the code solely declares constants and types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard type annotation practices for type safety with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS resource identifiers, with conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version. It defines a broad set of string literal types to enforce type safety when specifying AWS services, regions, and resource names. No input/output handling, external data processing, or code execution logic is present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be a well-structured static declaration of constants for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a type-safe declaration of AWS resource identifiers and service names. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security issues. It functions solely as a type definition utility to improve code correctness and clarity in other parts of a project.",
