  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for vpc-lattice service in AWS, including request/response types and associated models.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, type annotations, imports, and data definitions primarily from the 'typed dict' constructs and imports from standard and third-party libraries.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; data structures primarily define static data shapes for API interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve static data structures used for API requests/responses; no dynamic data processing or user input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors present. The code consists mainly of type annotations and data structure definitions. No code executes at runtime that could perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines type annotations using TypedDict and Union, imports necessary libraries, and provides comprehensive data models for API interactions. There are no functions executing logic, no code reading or executing external data, and no dynamic code execution mechanisms. The presence of docstrings and structured type annotations aligns with standard Python type hinting practices for SDKs or client libraries. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden code execution, or suspicious import patterns were identified. The code is purely declarative, serving as a schema for data exchange.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of static type definitions for API request and response data structures in an SDK context. It contains no executable logic, no data handling that could be malicious, and no suspicious patterns. Overall, it is safe and has no malicious intent.",
