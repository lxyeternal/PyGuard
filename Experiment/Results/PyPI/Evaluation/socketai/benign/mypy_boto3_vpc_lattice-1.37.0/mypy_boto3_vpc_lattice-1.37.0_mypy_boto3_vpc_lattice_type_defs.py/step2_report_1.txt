  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details of the code and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is solely a set of static type annotations, data models, and request/response schemas for an SDK or API client.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, external data handling, or executable code is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors.\n- Use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The overall conclusion across all reports is that the code is safe, benign, and purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The reports confirm that the code contains only static type definitions, with no runtime or executable logic.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The reports do not identify any logical errors or flaws in the data structures or annotations.\n\n- **Are the scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All scores are zero or very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n- **Is there any claim about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  **No.** The reports explicitly state that no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are suspected.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDicts and type annotations for API request/response data models.\n- It employs standard Python practices, including conditional imports for compatibility.\n- No runtime code, data processing, or external data handling exists.\n- The documentation and structure suggest it's a schema or stub file for SDK type checking, not executable logic.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The consistent consensus across all reports, combined with the detailed reasoning, confirms that the code is safe.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.5 or lower) are appropriate.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Personal Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0** (completely benign, purely declarative data schemas)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations and data models for an SDK or API client, with no malicious intent or security risks. The detailed analysis and consensus support a zero or negligible risk assessment.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe.",
