  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of executable or malicious code, anomalies, data flow, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n**Summary:** The code is purely static type definitions for the VPC Lattice SDK, with no runtime logic or external data handling. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior detected.  \n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is declarative, defining data schemas with no executable logic. The risk scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are correctly set to 0.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues; the report's scoring and reasoning are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role as static type annotations for SDK data structures. No dynamic code, external input processing, or malicious patterns.  \n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a set of type hints and data models, with no runtime behavior. The scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are appropriately zero.  \n**Conclusion:** No concerns; scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n**Summary:** Again, the code consists of type definitions for SDK interactions, with no runtime logic or external data processing. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.  \n**Assessment:** Valid. The code is purely declarative, serving as data schemas. The risk scores are correctly set to 0.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues; the assessment and scoring are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n**Summary:** The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for API schemas, with no external data handling or executable logic. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is static type annotations, and the risk scores are correctly zero.  \n**Conclusion:** No concerns; the analysis and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n**Summary:** Same pattern: static type definitions for SDK, no runtime logic, external data processing, or malicious code.  \n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely for type hinting, with no executable or suspicious behavior. The risk scores are correctly zero.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues; the reasoning and scoring are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is solely static type annotations and data schemas for an SDK or API client.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors in any report.  \n- **Security Risks:** Given the nature of the code (type definitions), the risk is inherently minimal or nonexistent.  \n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation or hidden code patterns.  \n**Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks inherent in static data definitions.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and well-justified. There are no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities in the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a well-structured, purely declarative set of type annotations and data schemas for an SDK. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is standard practice for API client libraries.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scoring and understanding; no changes needed.",
