{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for vpc-lattice service API interactions, including request/response schemas and data models.",
  "sources": "Constant strings, type annotations, and function/class definitions. Data input points include API request structures, data parsing, and type declarations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks are the API request/response payloads, especially fields related to resource identifiers, ARNs, credentials, or sensitive info such as 'policy' strings. No untrusted external data sources or code execution points are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data (e.g., user input, API calls) into typed dictionaries representing request and response schemas. No evident flow from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause data leaks or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. Code primarily consists of data structure definitions and type annotations. Usage of 'sys.version_info' for conditional imports is standard for compatibility, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly contains type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and constants for API data models related to a VPC Lattice service. It does not execute any logic or call external functions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden payloads. The imported modules and type annotations follow standard Python practices for defining API schemas. The license and comments are benign, with no indicators of malicious intent or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of data type definitions for API communication, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a well-structured, standard SDK type definition module without suspicious activities.",
