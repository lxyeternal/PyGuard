{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations and data model definitions for the vpc-lattice SDK, serving as schemas for request and response data structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data only through type annotations; no runtime data sources or external input handling are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or execution paths; the code consists solely of type definitions and conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for SDK type stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDicts, Union types, and conditional imports designed for static type checking. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external data handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident. The structure and content are consistent with typical SDK schema definitions, indicating a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static set of type annotations and data schemas for an SDK, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals point to a benign, purely declarative purpose.",
