{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for vpc-lattice service API interactions, facilitating type safety and clarity in a Python SDK or client.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input sources; it solely defines data types and constants for internal use.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there are no functions executing untrusted code, performing network operations, or handling external data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code purely defines static type structures without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely declarative with extensive use of TypedDict, Union, and type annotations. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides comprehensive type definitions for a service's API payloads, responses, and configurations, ensuring type safety and clarity. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, and defines numerous TypedDict structures to model request and response formats. No runtime logic, input handling, or external operations are present, eliminating typical attack vectors such as code injection or data leakage. The structure is consistent with standard SDK type definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage; the code is purely for type hinting and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of static type definitions for a Python SDK or client library. It contains no runtime code, external input handling, or network operations, and exhibits no malicious or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a benign, well-structured, and standard set of type annotations aimed at improving code correctness and developer experience.",
