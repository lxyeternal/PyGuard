  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for VPC Lattice service SDK, mainly to facilitate static type checking and ensure consistent data handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, and data definitions; no input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines data types and structures without executing untrusted operations or handling external inputs directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code solely declares type definitions and does not contain runtime data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. Usage of conditional imports based on Python version is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes type aliases and data structures (TypedDicts, Unions, and conditional imports) for a boto3-like SDK for VPC Lattice services. It includes various request and response type definitions, utilizing Python type hints for clarity and static analysis. There are no runtime operations, external data handling, or executable code that could be malicious. The code adheres to standard practices for SDK type definition files, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This module is purely declarative, providing structured type definitions for SDK interactions. It contains no executable or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Therefore, it poses no security risk.",
