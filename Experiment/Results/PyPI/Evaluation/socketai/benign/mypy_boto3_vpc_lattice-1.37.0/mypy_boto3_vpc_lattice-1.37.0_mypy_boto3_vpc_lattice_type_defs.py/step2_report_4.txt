  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely static type definitions, no runtime logic, no external data processing, no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, no suspicious imports or behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.5 (since no actual runtime code, minimal risk).  \n- **Conclusion:** Fully benign, safe, and standard for SDK type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—type annotations and data models, no runtime logic, no external data handling.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.5.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, static type definitions for SDK, no runtime code, no external data handling.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.5.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Type definitions for API interactions, no runtime logic, no external data processing.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.5.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—type annotations and data schemas, no runtime code or external data handling.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.5.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDicts, Union types, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Behavior:** No executable logic, no data processing, no external data handling, no runtime code.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None detected across all reports. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious imports.\n- **Security Risks:** None apparent; the code is purely declarative for type checking and documentation.\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk, purely static type definitions)\n\n**Note:** The reports' assigned scores of 0.5 or similar are conservative and align with the understanding that static type definitions inherently pose minimal to no security risk but are not entirely risk-free in the sense of zero risk (since they could theoretically be misused if embedded in malicious packages). However, given the evidence, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for an SDK, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
