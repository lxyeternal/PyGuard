{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for VPC Lattice service SDK in Python, intended for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "None, the code mainly consists of type definitions, imports, and docstrings; it does not process external input.",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no data processing or external I/O operations, data flows are only within type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists; the code only defines data types and does not execute logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code strictly contains type definitions and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for a Python SDK, including TypedDicts, Union types, and conditional imports for compatibility. No runtime code, data handling, or external data processing exists. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious data flows. The structure is standard for a type stub or SDK data structure definitions. No suspicious imports or code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, providing type annotations for SDK data structures. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious behavior. Based on the provided content, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
