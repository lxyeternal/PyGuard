  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that outputs package and library information.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout.write for outputting info",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; sys.argv input is checked for '--version'",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() and outputs version; otherwise calls print_info()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; straightforward output functions",
  "analysis": "The script primarily prints package info and version based on command-line arguments. It reads command-line input via sys.argv and outputs data via sys.stdout.write. There are no external data sources, network operations, or untrusted data flows. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a simple CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It functions solely to provide static information to users.",
