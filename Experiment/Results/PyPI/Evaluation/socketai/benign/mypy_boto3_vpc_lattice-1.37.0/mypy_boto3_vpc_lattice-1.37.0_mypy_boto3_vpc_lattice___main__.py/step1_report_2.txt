  "sources": "sys.argv (user input), sys.stdout (output display)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (output), sys.argv (input source for command line arguments)",
  "flows": "User input (sys.argv) triggers print_version(), which outputs version info to stdout. Otherwise, print_info() outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI tool that outputs package information or version details based on command-line arguments. It uses standard library functions for input and output, with no data leaks, external network activity, or malicious code. There are no hidden behaviors or suspicious code paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic output functions based on user input, with no indication of malware or security threats.",
