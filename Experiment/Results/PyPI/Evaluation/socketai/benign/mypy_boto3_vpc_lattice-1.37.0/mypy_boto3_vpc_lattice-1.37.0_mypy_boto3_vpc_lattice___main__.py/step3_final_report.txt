  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "flows": "Command-line args → conditional check → stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on '--version' argument. It uses standard library functions without dynamic code execution, external network access, or handling untrusted input beyond command-line args. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The logic is simple and correct, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and safe. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
