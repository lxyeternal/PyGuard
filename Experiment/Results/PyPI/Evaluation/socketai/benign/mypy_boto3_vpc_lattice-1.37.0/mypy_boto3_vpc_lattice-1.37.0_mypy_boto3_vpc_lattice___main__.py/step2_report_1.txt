  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the code step-by-step.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The script is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details.\n- It uses `sys.argv` to detect the `--version` argument.\n- It writes output via `sys.stdout.write()`.\n- No dynamic code execution, external network access, or data collection is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and safe.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0, which are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports:\n\n1. **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:**  \n   All reports assign `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`, which is correct. The code is clear and static.\n\n2. **Security Risk:**  \n   The security risk is 0 across all reports, justified by the lack of any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n3. **Flow & Logic:**  \n   The logic is straightforward: check for `--version` argument, output info accordingly. No flaws or assumptions are evident.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \n   The reports correctly identify no vulnerabilities, no external dependencies, and no dynamic behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nGiven the simplicity, static nature, and the absence of any suspicious activity, I agree with the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0       | No malicious code or behavior present.                      |\n| Obfuscated      | 0       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                     |\n| Security Risk   | 0       | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or external access.         |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, static CLI utility with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; no changes needed.",
