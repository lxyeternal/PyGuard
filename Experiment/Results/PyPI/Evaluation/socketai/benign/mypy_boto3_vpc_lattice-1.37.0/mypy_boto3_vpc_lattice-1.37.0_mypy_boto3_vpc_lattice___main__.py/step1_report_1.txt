  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script providing package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to stdout using sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "If '--version' argument is present, calls print_version() -> writes version info; otherwise, calls print_info() -> writes package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. No external network access or data collection evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that responds to command-line arguments. It writes static package info and version data to stdout. There are no sources of untrusted input beyond command-line args, which are handled safely. No sinks involve untrusted data processing or external network communication. The code is simple, well-structured, and uses standard library functions without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility intended for informational purposes. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
