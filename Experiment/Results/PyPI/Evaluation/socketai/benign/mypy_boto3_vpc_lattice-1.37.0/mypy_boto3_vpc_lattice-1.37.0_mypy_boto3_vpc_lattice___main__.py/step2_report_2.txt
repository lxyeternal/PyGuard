  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the corresponding code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version info based on command-line arguments.\n- It uses standard library functions (`sys.argv`, `sys.stdout.write()`).\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, external network access, or handling of untrusted input beyond command-line args.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malicious elements.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent, accurate, and based on the code's simplicity. They correctly conclude that the script is safe and intended solely for informational purposes.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n  \n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The **first report** mentions a `securityRisk` of 0, which is consistent.\n- The **second to fifth reports** also correctly assign 0.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since the code is static, does not execute untrusted code, or access external resources, scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should all remain at 0.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I would assign:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect this. No changes needed.",
