  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3 vpc-lattice service client, primarily for static type safety and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations referencing boto3 paginator interfaces and type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, external I/O, or network activity; static class and method signatures only.",
  "flows": "Method 'paginate' accepts kwargs with specific types and returns PageIterator objects; no untrusted data flow or external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for paginators with type annotations, conditional import of 'Unpack' for Python >= 3.12, and documentation links. It is static, well-structured, and aligns with auto-generated SDK stub patterns. No dynamic execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The use of 'Unpack' is standard for type hinting. Overall, the code is benign and intended solely for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of boto3 paginator stub classes with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It is appropriate for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
