  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for boto3's vpc-lattice service, providing a structured SDK interface with detailed method signatures and documentation.",
  "sources": "Method parameters unpacked from **kwargs, API call signatures, type definitions imported from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "API calls to AWS services; no untrusted data sources or external command executions; parameters are for API interactions.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (kwargs) flows into API request methods; no data leaks or malicious data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is a straightforward SDK stub.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-typed SDK wrapper for AWS VPC Lattice, with extensive method signatures, documentation, and type annotations. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage signals are present. Use of dynamic kwargs and URL presigning features are standard SDK functionalities, not indicators of malicious intent. The high confidence scores (close to 1) reflect the code's benign and legitimate nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK client wrapper for AWS VPC Lattice with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The minimal security risk scores are appropriate given the context. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
