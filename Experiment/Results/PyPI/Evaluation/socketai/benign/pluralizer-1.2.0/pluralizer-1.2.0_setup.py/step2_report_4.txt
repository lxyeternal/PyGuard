  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Reads `README.md` for `long_description`.\n- Retrieves `PYPI_VERSION` environment variable; raises an exception if missing.\n- Calls `setup()` with static metadata, including the version from the environment variable.\n- Uses only standard libraries; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign, standard setup script, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the code.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no risks.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard package setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; straightforward, standard practice.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, notes reliance on environment variable without validation but considers it not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — perhaps overestimating, since environment variable reliance is common and not inherently risky.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** The concern about validation is valid but doesn't imply malicious intent. The risk score might be slightly high but still acceptable given the cautious approach.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, notes proper validation of environment variable presence.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal, aligns with standard practices.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- **Presence of malicious code?** None detected. The code only reads files and environment variables, with no code injection or dynamic execution.\n- **Obfuscation?** None.\n- **Malware?** No evidence of malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Risks?** Relying on environment variables is common; raising exceptions if missing is standard. No vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware scores** across all reports are correctly set to 0.\n- The **security risk scores** are mostly very low, which is appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated** scores are correctly 0.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard, safe setup script.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent with the actual code. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The environment variable reliance is standard practice, and no security risks are evident.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the scores or assessments.",
