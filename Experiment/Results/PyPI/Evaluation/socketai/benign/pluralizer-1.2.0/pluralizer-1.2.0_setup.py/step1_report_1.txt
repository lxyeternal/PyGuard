{
  "purpose": "This script is used to configure and prepare the Python package 'pluralizer' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description and retrieves the 'PYPI_VERSION' environment variable.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup' function uses the 'version' variable, which is set from the environment variable, to define the package version. No untrusted data is directly used in insecure ways.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PYPI_VERSION' (source) flows into the 'setup' function as the package version (sink). The README.md content (source) flows into 'long_description' used in package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The script raises an exception if 'PYPI_VERSION' is not set, which is a common pattern for ensuring version control. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly reads a README file for documentation purposes. It retrieves 'PYPI_VERSION' from environment variables, which is standard practice for dynamic versioning. The setup configuration appears straightforward and adheres to best practices. No external data sources, user inputs, or potentially malicious code are involved. No unusual code structures or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and benign, with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It securely handles versioning through environment variables and reads documentation files properly. No security risks identified.",
