  "purpose": "Configure Python package metadata for distribution, reading long description from README.md and setting version from environment variable.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, retrieving PYPI_VERSION environment variable",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used insecurely or passed to dangerous functions",
  "flows": "Environment variable PYPI_VERSION flows into setup() as version parameter",
  "anomalies": "Dependence on environment variable PYPI_VERSION without validation beyond existence; no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, reading a README file and environment variable for versioning. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. Multiple reviews confirm the benign nature, with scores consistently indicating no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk. The reliance on an environment variable is typical in CI/CD pipelines and does not imply malicious intent. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The environment variable dependency is standard practice and does not pose security risks. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1).",
