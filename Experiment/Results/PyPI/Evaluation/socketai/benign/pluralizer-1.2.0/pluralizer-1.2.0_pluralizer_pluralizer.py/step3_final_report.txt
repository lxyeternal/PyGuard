{
  "purpose": "This code implements a linguistic utility for pluralizing and singularizing English words using predefined regex rules and mappings.",
  "sources": "Imported rule lists from external modules: irregular_rules, pluralization_rules, singularization_rules, uncountable_rules.",
  "sinks": "String operations involving regex substitutions and case restorations; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input words are processed through regex matching and replacement rules, with optional case preservation, to produce plural or singular forms.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Reliance on external rule modules could be a concern if those contain malicious regex patterns, but this cannot be determined from the provided code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of pluralization/singularization logic, using regex rules and mappings. It does not perform any external system calls, network activity, or data leaks. The imported rule lists are external and could, in theory, contain malicious patterns, but the core code is safe and well-structured. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured linguistic utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities evident from the implementation. External rule lists could pose a risk if malicious, but this is outside the scope of the provided code. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
