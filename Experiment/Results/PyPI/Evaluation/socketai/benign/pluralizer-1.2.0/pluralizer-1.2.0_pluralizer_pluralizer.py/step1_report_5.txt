{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for pluralizing and singularizing English words using predefined linguistic rules. It facilitates automated language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported rule lists (irregular_rules, pluralization_rules, singularization_rules, uncountable_rules). No user input or external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "The code performs regex-based string transformations internally. No data sinks or external output functions are present that could leak data. There are no network connections, file I/O, or external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the rule lists into internal rule processing and string transformation methods. No external untrusted input is processed beyond code initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on external rule modules; their content is unknown, but this alone is not suspicious. No suspicious behavior or privacy violations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pluralizer class that manages pluralization and singularization rules via regex replacements. It uses predefined rule lists imported from a module, which are applied through methods like replace, sanitizeWord, and checkWord. No user input handling, network activity, or file I/O is performed. All methods are string manipulation focused. The code does not perform any external data transmission, credential handling, or system modification. It appears to be a standard linguistic utility without malicious intent. Since no external data processing or untrusted input is involved, the likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a linguistic utility for pluralizing and singularizing words using predefined rules. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior based on its structure and content. It is safe for use in applications requiring language processing. The only potential concern is the source of imported rules, but within this code, no malicious activity is detected.",
