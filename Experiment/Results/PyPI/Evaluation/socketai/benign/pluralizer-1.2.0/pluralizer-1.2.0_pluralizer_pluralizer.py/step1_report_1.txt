{
  "purpose": "This code implements a pluralization and singularization utility for English words, using predefined rules and irregular mappings. It is intended for text processing and natural language automation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data (rules and words) are defined within the code or imported from other modules.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the code manipulates strings and regex patterns without any network, file, or system command interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code processes strings via regex rules and mappings internally, with no external flow or data leakage paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code. No malicious behavior or privacy violations are evident. The only notable aspect is the use of regex rules for string transformations, which is standard for such tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for pluralization/singularization with methods to add rules, handle irregular words, and check word forms. It performs regex-based replacements, case restoration, and maintains internal mappings. There is no evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The logic is straightforward and aligned with common linguistic processing. The code does not process external input sources or perform unsafe operations beyond string manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured utility for linguistic transformations. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are present. It functions solely to convert words between singular and plural forms based on rules and mappings.",
