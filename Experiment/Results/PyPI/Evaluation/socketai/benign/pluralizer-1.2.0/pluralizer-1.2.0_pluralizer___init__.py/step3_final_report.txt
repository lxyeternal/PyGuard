  "purpose": "Minimal module setup defining license metadata and importing a class from a local module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __license__, import from .pluralizer, and setting __all__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Static import and assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module declaration with a license string, a local import, and a __all__ definition. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and confidence scores of 1. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these assessments. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of security issues or malicious intent. All reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
