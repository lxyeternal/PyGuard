{
  "purpose": "Define the package's license and expose the Pluralizer class for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the license string and imports the Pluralizer class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input points or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; import statements are static, and the license string is hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets a license string and exports a class from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The import is local, and the license string is hardcoded, which is typical for package metadata. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard package metadata and module export configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
