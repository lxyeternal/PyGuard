  "purpose": "Export the Pluralizer class from the pluralizer module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'Pluralizer' from a local module; no input data read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal, standard module export syntax, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a license string, imports a local class, and defines an export list. It follows standard Python module conventions with no suspicious or malicious constructs. The code does not handle user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. There are no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module that exposes a class for external use. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
