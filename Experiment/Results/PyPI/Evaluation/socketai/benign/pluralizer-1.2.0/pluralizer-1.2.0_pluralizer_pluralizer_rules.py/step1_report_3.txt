{
  "purpose": "This code provides pluralization, singularization, and uncountable word rules for English words, primarily used for linguistic processing such as natural language generation or analysis.",
  "sources": "Constants and data structures defining rules and irregular forms; no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted sources; the code operates purely on predefined rules.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is rule-based and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior observed; the code is a standard linguistic rule set without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several lists for irregular rules, pluralization, singularization, and uncountable words. These are used for morphological transformations in natural language processing. No external input handling, network activity, or secret management is present. The code appears to be a standard, rule-based linguistic module without malicious intent or obfuscation. It is purely data-driven, with regex patterns for language rules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of linguistic rules for pluralization and singularization. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as a static rule set for language processing, with no active external data or network communication.",
