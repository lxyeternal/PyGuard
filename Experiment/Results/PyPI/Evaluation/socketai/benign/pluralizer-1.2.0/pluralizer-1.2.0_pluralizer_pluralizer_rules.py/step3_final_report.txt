  "purpose": "Defines static linguistic transformation rules for pluralization, singularization, and uncountable nouns in English.",
  "sources": "Lists of irregular rules, regex-based pluralization, singularization, and uncountable noun patterns.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; static data structures only, no external data or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or external data processing; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static data, no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of predefined lists and regex patterns for language processing, with no runtime data handling, external dependencies, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the static, benign nature of the code. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static linguistic utility module with no malicious intent or security concerns. All existing reports are accurate; the scores should be maintained as zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
