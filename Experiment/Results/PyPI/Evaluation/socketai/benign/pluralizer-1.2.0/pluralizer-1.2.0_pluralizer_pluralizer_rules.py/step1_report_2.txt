{
  "purpose": "The code defines linguistic rules for pluralization, singularization, and uncountable nouns, likely for a language processing or NLP task.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data structures: lists of rules, regular expressions, and word lists.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted input or data from external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only initializes data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines static data: lists of irregular words, regex-based rules for pluralization and singularization, and uncountable noun patterns. There are no dynamic executions, network operations, or input/output handling present. It appears to be a module for language processing. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage are detected. No embedded code or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign language rule definition module with no malicious intent. It is safe and appears to serve linguistic processing purposes.",
