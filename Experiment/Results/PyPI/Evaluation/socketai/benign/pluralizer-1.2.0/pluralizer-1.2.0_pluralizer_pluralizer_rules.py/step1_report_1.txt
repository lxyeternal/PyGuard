{
  "purpose": "The code provides rules and regex patterns for pluralization, singularization, and handling uncountable nouns in English language processing, likely for linguistic or NLP purposes.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data directly; it defines data structures (lists, regex patterns) for processing linguistic transformations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink within this code snippet as it only defines static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be static and straightforward language processing rules.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static lists and compiled regex patterns for linguistic transformations such as pluralization and singularization, and uncountable nouns. There are no input/output operations, no external data access, no obfuscated or dynamic code execution. All patterns and rules are standard for language processing tasks. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of language processing rules for English pluralization and singularization, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It is purely static data definitions with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
