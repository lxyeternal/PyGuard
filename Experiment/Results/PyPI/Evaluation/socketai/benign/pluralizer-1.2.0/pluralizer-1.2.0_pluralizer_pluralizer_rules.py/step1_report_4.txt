{
  "purpose": "Define pluralization, singularization, and uncountable rules for English words, primarily for linguistic processing or text manipulation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; all data are hardcoded lists and regex patterns within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows to a vulnerable or sensitive operation; the code does not process external input or execute data in a way that impacts system security.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only defines static rules and data structures, with no data flow or dynamic execution based on external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code consists solely of static rule definitions and data. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static lists and regex patterns for linguistic transformations, including irregular word forms, pluralization, singularization, and uncountable nouns. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. It appears to be a typical language processing setup with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The structure and content are straightforward, intended for linguistic normalization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely linguistic in nature. It only contains static data structures used for text processing and does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
