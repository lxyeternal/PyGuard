  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure the accuracy of the findings and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward utility to retrieve the version of the 'psycopg-c' package.\n- It uses standard Python library functions (`importlib.metadata.version`) with exception handling.\n- No untrusted input, external data processing, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The reports consistently conclude benign intent, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code matches the original snippet.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected.\n- No hardcoded secrets, external effects, or malicious code.\n- The logic is simple, standard, and secure.\n\n### Issue Scores:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- Confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), reflecting certainty.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports do not suggest any issues that would warrant raising the risk score above 0.0.\n- The reasoning is sound; no assumptions are made beyond the code's apparent intent.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions and scores. The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a standard version retrieval utility with no security implications. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and risk.",
