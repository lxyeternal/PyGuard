  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports `metadata` from `importlib`.\n- Attempts to get the version of the package `psycopg-c` via `metadata.version(\"psycopg-c\")`.\n- If the package isn't found, it defaults `__version__` to `\"0.0.0.0\"`.\n- No other logic, data processing, or external effects are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  **No.** The code is straightforward, standard, and performs a simple version retrieval with exception handling.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  **No.** The logic is sound, and the reasoning in the reports aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n  - Confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n  \n  These seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification of Risk Scores:\n- The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is justified because:\n  - The code only reads package metadata.\n  - It handles missing packages gracefully.\n  - No untrusted input, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n  - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Malware Score:\n- All reports correctly identify malware as 0, which is accurate.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made, and none are evident. The code does not execute external commands, process untrusted input, or perform any dangerous operations.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **The code is benign, standard, and free of security issues.**  \n- **All reports correctly identify this.**  \n- **The scores are appropriate and justified.**\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThe code's purpose is purely to retrieve version info, with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No changes needed. The code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security threat.",
