{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'psycopg-c' package using importlib.metadata, with fallback to '0.0.0.0' if not found.",
  "sources": "metadata.version('psycopg-c') call, which reads package metadata",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__, no external sinks or data leaks",
  "flows": "Source: metadata.version() output -> sink: __version__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version retrieval with exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports metadata from importlib, attempts to get the version of 'psycopg-c', and defaults to '0.0.0.0' if not found. It performs no network, file, or user input operations. The logic is simple, standard, and secure. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The exception handling is appropriate, and the code's purpose is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for retrieving package version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.",
