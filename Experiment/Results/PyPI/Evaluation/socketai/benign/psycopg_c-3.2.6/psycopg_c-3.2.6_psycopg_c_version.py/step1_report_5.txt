{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and expose the version number of the 'psycopg-c' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the package metadata using importlib.metadata.version() for 'psycopg-c'.",
  "sinks": "The version string (__version__) is stored in a variable but not used further; no sinks or data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to obtain the package version from metadata and assigns it to __version__; fallback to '0.0.0.0' if not found.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The fallback version is a common pattern, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script aims to get the package version using standard Python library functions. It handles the case where the package metadata might be missing. No user input, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple and standard implementation to retrieve package version information. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
