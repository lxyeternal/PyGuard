{
  "purpose": "To define and assign the version number of the 'psycopg-c' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata using 'importlib.metadata.version' to get the version of 'psycopg-c'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only accesses package metadata and assigns it to a variable.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves package version metadata and assigns it to '__version__' without further processing or data flow complexities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and uses standard library functions for metadata retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'metadata' from 'importlib', attempts to obtain the version of the 'psycopg-c' package, and defaults to '0.0.0.0' if the package is not found. It performs a simple metadata check without executing external commands or handling untrusted input. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network operations, and no suspicious code behaviors. The purpose appears to be just version reporting, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package version retrieval snippet with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It is a benign utility for version management.",
