  "purpose": "Defines and retrieves the version information for the 'psycopg-c' package.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata using importlib.metadata to get the version of 'psycopg-c'.",
  "tails": "None; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The code fetches the package version metadata as source, no data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward version retrieval with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to obtain the version number of the 'psycopg-c' package using importlib.metadata. If the package is not found, it defaults to '0.0.0.0'. There are no hardcoded secrets, no untrusted input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations. The code is simple and standard for version detection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package version retrieval snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
