  "purpose": "Define the version of the 'psycopg-c' package by retrieving metadata from the installed package information.",
  "sources": "The call to 'metadata.version(\"psycopg-c\")' which reads package metadata from the installed environment.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data based on user input or external sources.",
  "flows": "The package metadata is retrieved and assigned to '__version__'. There are no external data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'metadata' from 'importlib' and attempts to fetch the version of the installed 'psycopg-c' package. If the package is not found, it defaults to '0.0.0.0'. The code is simple and serves solely to report package version information. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The use of 'importlib.metadata' is standard for version retrieval and does not involve any obfuscation or dangerous constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely intended for version retrieval of the 'psycopg-c' package. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
