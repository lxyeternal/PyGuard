{
  "purpose": "To define and retrieve the version information of the 'psycopg-c' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata using 'metadata.version(\"psycopg-c\")'.",
  "sinks": "The version string assignment '__version__' is the only sink; no untrusted data processing or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to get package version and assigns it to '__version__', with fallback to '0.0.0.0' if not found.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard Python library calls for metadata retrieval; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'metadata' from 'importlib' to obtain package version info. It handles 'PackageNotFoundError' gracefully, defaulting to '0.0.0.0'. The code is straightforward, with no external data inputs, no dangerous operations, and no suspicious control flow. It is a typical version retrieval pattern in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, legitimate, and performs standard version retrieval without any malicious intent or security risks.",
