{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to serve as a module for the psycopg PostgreSQL database adapter, providing version information and ensuring proper import order.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sys.modules dictionary to verify if 'psycopg' has been imported.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code checks if 'psycopg' is imported before importing its own version module, preventing incorrect import sequences.",
  "anomalies": "The code enforces a specific import order which could be unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies the import order of the 'psycopg' package, raising an ImportError if 'psycopg' has not been imported prior to this module. It then imports the version information from a local module. No malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity is evident. The logic is straightforward and typical for package initialization routines. No anomalies such as obfuscation or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard initialization snippet for a Python package, ensuring correct import order and providing version info. It does not contain malicious code or security risks.",
