{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of the psycopg package, specifically for PostgreSQL database interaction in Python, likely involved in initializing or verifying package import order.",
  "sources": "Reading the sys.modules dictionary to check for the presence of 'psycopg'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data leakage, system modification, or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "The code checks if 'psycopg' is imported before proceeding; raises ImportError if not, which halts execution.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the strict check to ensure 'psycopg' is imported before 'psycopg_c', which might suggest dependency ordering but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to access system modules, then enforces an import order by checking sys.modules for 'psycopg'. If 'psycopg' isn't imported beforehand, it raises an ImportError. This control logic ensures correct module initialization order. The code imports a version string from a local module, which is standard practice. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an import order check for the psycopg package, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It appears to be a standard integrity or dependency enforcement measure within the package.",
