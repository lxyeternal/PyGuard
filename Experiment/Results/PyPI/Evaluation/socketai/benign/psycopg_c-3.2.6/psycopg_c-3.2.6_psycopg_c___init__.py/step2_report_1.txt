  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it performs a simple import order check and imports version info.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0. The confidence is 1, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it enforces import order and imports version info.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is accurate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the code. Security risk is 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is the same import order check with version import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; straightforward import order check.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same logic applies; simple import order enforcement and version import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.  \n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n- The code in question is a minimal, standard package initialization snippet that enforces import order and imports version info.  \n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.  \n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code.  \n- The confidence scores of 1 are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, serving a legitimate purpose in package integrity and dependency management.",
