  "purpose": "Provide metadata and ensure correct import order for the psycopg PostgreSQL adapter package.",
  "sources": "sys.modules, the import statement for version information",
  "sinks": "Potentially the import statement if manipulated to execute malicious code during import",
  "flows": "sys.modules check to prevent improper import order, then importing version info",
  "anomalies": "Simple import order check; no suspicious or unusual code behavior or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code performs a basic check to ensure that the main 'psycopg' package is imported before 'psycopg_c'. It raises an ImportError if not, to prevent misordered imports. The only other operation is importing version info from a local module. There are no obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code constructs. No external data is read, and no data is transmitted or stored in an insecure manner.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, harmless code snippet intended to enforce import order. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
