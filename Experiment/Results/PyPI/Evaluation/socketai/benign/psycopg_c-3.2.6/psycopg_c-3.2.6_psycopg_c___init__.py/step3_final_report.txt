  "purpose": "Enforces import order for 'psycopg' package and imports version info.",
  "sources": "Checks 'psycopg' in sys.modules; reads version string from local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Source: sys.modules check; Sink: import of version info; Flow: import order enforcement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import order check, no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import order validation by raising an ImportError if 'psycopg' is not already imported, then imports a version string. It contains no obfuscation, external data handling, or malicious behavior. The logic is clear, standard, and benign, with no security risks or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization snippet enforcing import order and importing version info. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence.",
