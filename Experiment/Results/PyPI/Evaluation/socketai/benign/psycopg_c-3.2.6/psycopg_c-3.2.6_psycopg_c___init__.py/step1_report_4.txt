{
  "purpose": "Provide metadata and dependency management for the psycopg PostgreSQL adapter package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'sys.modules' to verify import order, and imports a version string from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication points are present.",
  "flows": "The flow checks the import state (sys.modules) and then imports a version identifier from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The import check is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a descriptive comment about the psycopg package. It then imports sys to access runtime module data. It performs a check to ensure 'psycopg' has been imported prior to 'psycopg_c' (likely a companion module), raising ImportError if this order isn't met. It then imports a version string from a local module. All operations are standard import and check procedures, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple dependency and import order check with a version import, containing no malicious behavior or security risks.",
