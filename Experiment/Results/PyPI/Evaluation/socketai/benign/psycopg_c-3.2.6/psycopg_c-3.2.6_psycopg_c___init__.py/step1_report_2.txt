{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module or package initialization script for a PostgreSQL database adapter for Python, specifically related to psycopg and its C optimization component.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sys.modules dictionary to verify import order.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Checks presence of 'psycopg' in sys.modules before proceeding, ensuring proper import order.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs a simple import check.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a descriptive comment about psycopg. It imports the sys module and then verifies whether 'psycopg' is already imported by inspecting sys.modules. If 'psycopg' is not present, it raises an ImportError to enforce import order, likely to prevent initialization issues. The script then imports the version number from a local module. There are no data manipulations, external network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The logic is straightforward and standard for package initialization, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import order check and version import for a psycopg package component. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks, serving a legitimate purpose in package initialization. The confidence score is high as the code is straightforward and common in Python packages.",
