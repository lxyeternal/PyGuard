{
  "purpose": "The script determines whether to include Cython as a build dependency based on the presence of .pyx files, facilitating conditional compilation for a Python extension module.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem to check for 'psycopg_c/_psycopg.pyx' and opens 'pyproject.toml' to extract configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted code or handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Checks for the existence of a file to decide whether to require Cython dependencies; reads configuration data from a local file to determine build requirements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally adds Cython as a build dependency based on the presence of a source file. It safely reads local files ('pyproject.toml') to determine configuration. No user input or untrusted data handling is involved. The logic is straightforward and consistent with standard build processes. No malicious or malicious-looking behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign build configuration script that conditionally manages dependencies for building a Cython extension. No malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
