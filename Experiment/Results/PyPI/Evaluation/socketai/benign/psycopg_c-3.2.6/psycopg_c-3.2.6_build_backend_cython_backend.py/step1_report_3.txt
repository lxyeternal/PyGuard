  "purpose": "Determine whether the build backend script dynamically manages build dependencies based on the presence of Cython source files and configuration, to facilitate conditional compilation.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem to check for 'psycopg_c/_psycopg.pyx' and opens 'pyproject.toml' to extract build requirements.",
  "sinks": "Uses the data from 'pyproject.toml' to return build requirements; no data sinks for untrusted input that could lead to exploits.",
  "flows": "Checks for the existence of a source file -> reads configuration from 'pyproject.toml' -> returns dependency list based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally determines build requirements based on the presence of source files and configuration files. It uses standard library functions to read files and parse a configuration file in TOML format. No malicious or suspicious logic, no code injection, data leakage, or privacy violations. The code appears to be a straightforward build helper for a Python package with conditional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build script managing dependencies based on source file presence and configuration. No malicious intent or malicious behavior is detected. It functions as a build helper without security risks.",
