{
  "purpose": "The script determines build dependencies for a Cython-based project, adding Cython requirements if source files are present.",
  "sources": "Reading the presence of 'psycopg_c/_psycopg.pyx', opening and parsing 'pyproject.toml'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; file operations are safe and controlled.",
  "flows": "Check for .pyx files -> conditionally load 'pyproject.toml' -> extract 'cython-requires' dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs filesystem checks and configuration file parsing. It conditionally adds build requirements based on the existence of specific source files, which is a standard and safe practice. Usage of 'os.path.exists' and safe file reading with 'with open' is appropriate. The reliance on standard libraries and 'setuptools.build_meta' indicates no obfuscation or malicious intent. No external or untrusted inputs are processed in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a build configuration script, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard checks and configuration parsing for a build process.",
