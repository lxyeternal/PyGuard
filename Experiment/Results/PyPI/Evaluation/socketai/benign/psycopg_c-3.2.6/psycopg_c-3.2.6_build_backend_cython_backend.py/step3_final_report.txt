  "purpose": "Check for the presence of a Cython source file and determine build dependencies accordingly, based on filesystem and configuration file status.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'psycopg_c/_psycopg.pyx'; reading 'pyproject.toml' to extract 'cython-requires' dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only local file existence checks and configuration parsing.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check leads to reading 'pyproject.toml' if source exists; no external data or untrusted input flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem existence checks and reads a configuration file to determine build dependencies. It relies solely on safe, standard library functions without dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling untrusted input. The logic is straightforward and typical for build scripts. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The minimal risk score of 0.1 is acceptable given the filesystem and config file interactions, but a score of 0 would also be justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward build helper script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
