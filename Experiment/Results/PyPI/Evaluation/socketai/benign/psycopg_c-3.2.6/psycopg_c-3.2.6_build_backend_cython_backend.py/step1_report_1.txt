{
  "purpose": "Determine build dependencies for a Cython-based project based on presence of .pyx files and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem to check for 'psycopg_c/_psycopg.pyx' and opens 'pyproject.toml' to extract dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; file existence checks and configuration parsing are standard operations.",
  "flows": "Checks for the existence of a source file; if present, reads 'pyproject.toml' to get Cython requirements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard library functions safely.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally includes Cython dependencies based on the presence of source files. It performs file existence checks and parses a configuration file for dependencies. No external data or untrusted input is used beyond filesystem checks and configuration parsing, which are safe operations. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The purpose is clearly for build configuration, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build script that conditionally adds dependencies based on source file presence. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this code. It is safe to use.",
