  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward build helper script.\n- They confirm that the script checks for the presence of a specific `.pyx` file (`psycopg_c/_psycopg.pyx`) to determine whether to include Cython dependencies.\n- The script reads `pyproject.toml` to extract configuration data (`cython-requires`).\n- No untrusted data sinks, network operations, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The logic is standard for conditional dependency management during build processes.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1, some 0.9), indicating strong agreement on safety.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are identified in the code.\n- **Malware or malicious intent:** None detected; the code is purely for build configuration.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None significant; some reports mention very low risk scores (~0.1), which are acceptable given the context.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The code uses safe standard library functions (`os.path.exists`, `open`, `tomllib`) appropriately.\n- No assumptions are made beyond filesystem checks and configuration parsing, which are safe.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correct given the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, justified because the script is a benign build helper with minimal risk.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- One report assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which is reasonable given the context—it's a very low risk, not indicative of malicious activity.\n- The other reports assign 0, which is more conservative and justified.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and performs only build-related filesystem and configuration checks.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The low risk scores are appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (since the code is standard and safe)\n\n**In conclusion,** this is a benign, well-understood build helper script with no security issues. The scores in the reports are reasonable, and I agree with their assessments.",
