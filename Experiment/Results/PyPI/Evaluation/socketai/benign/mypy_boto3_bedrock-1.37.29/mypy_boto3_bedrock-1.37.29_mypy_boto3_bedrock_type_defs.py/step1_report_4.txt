{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for various data structures used in a Python SDK for a bedrock service, including request and response types, configurations, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Type annotations are derived from imported type definitions, constant declarations, and the structure of TypedDict classes, which do not process external or untrusted data directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network communications, file operations, or data exfiltration points within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows are primarily through the structured type definitions and are used for validation and documentation purposes; no data processing or flow logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of unusual code or backdoors; no hardcoded credentials, secret tokens, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code adheres to standard type annotation patterns for SDK definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only type annotation definitions, class declarations, and constant imports, all of which are typical for a structured SDK or API client library. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. The use of standard libraries, type hints, and docstrings indicates a focus on static typing and documentation. No external data sources, sinks, or network interactions are embedded within this code. The code appears to be a well-structured, purely declarative set of type definitions, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of Python type annotations for an SDK's data structures, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate, structured set of type definitions for API requests, responses, and configurations. The code is consistent with standard SDK development practices and does not include any malicious or suspicious elements.",
