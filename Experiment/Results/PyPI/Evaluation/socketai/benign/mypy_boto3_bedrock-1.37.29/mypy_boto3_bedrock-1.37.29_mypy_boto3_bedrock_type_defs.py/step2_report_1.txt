  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code in detail:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - The code is composed entirely of `TypedDict` classes, `Union` types, imports, and type annotations.\n   - No functions, dynamic code execution, or runtime logic are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code patterns are detected.\n   - All dependencies are standard or from well-known type extension libraries (`typing_extensions`, `botocore`, etc.).\n   - The purpose is clearly to define data schemas for an SDK or API client, which is a common pattern in SDK development.\n\n2. **Type Annotations and Data Structures:**\n   - The code defines comprehensive data schemas for request/response types, configurations, metadata, and models.\n   - The extensive use of `TypedDict`, `Union`, `List`, `Dict`, and `Literal` indicates a focus on static type safety and validation.\n   - No runtime processing, no external data handling, and no executable logic.\n\n3. **Security and Malware Risks:**\n   - The code does not execute or process untrusted data directly.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or sabotage.\n   - No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n   - The reported \"anomalies\" are absent; the code appears standard and clean.\n\n4. **Report Summaries:**\n   - All reports (except reports 2 and 3, which are empty) agree that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious intent.\n   - The confidence levels are high (0.95 to 1), indicating a strong consensus that the code is benign.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n   - The overall security risk is 0, which is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **The code is a set of type definitions for an SDK, with no malicious or suspicious elements.**\n- **The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate and reasonable.**\n- **No changes to scores are necessary.**\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured schema definition for a Python SDK, with no security concerns.",
