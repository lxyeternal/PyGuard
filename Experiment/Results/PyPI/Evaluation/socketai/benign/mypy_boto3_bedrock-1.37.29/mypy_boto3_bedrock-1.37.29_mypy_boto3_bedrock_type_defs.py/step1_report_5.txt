  "purpose": "Type definitions for bedrock service API data structures used in AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and local literals.",
  "sinks": "TypedDicts, Union, List, Dict, and other type annotations defining data structures and API request/response formats.",
  "flows": "Data type definitions used for request and response serialization/deserialization; no runtime data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow. No network or system commands present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of type annotations, data structure definitions, and imports for static type checking. All types are standard Python typing constructs or from external libraries used for typing. No functions, runtime logic, or external commands are present. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward, auto-generated or manually maintained set of type definitions for AWS Bedrock SDK integrations, with no suspicious or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "This module is purely for defining data structures with no runtime execution logic. It is free from malware or malicious behavior. It serves as a type definition layer to assist static analysis and code correctness, not executing any code that could harm or compromise systems.",
