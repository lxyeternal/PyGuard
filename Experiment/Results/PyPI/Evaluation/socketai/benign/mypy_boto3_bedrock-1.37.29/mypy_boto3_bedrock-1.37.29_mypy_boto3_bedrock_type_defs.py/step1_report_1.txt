  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for a boto3-styled SDK for bedrock services, including models, configurations, and request/response types.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, and data structure definitions throughout the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks handling untrusted data; the code mostly defines data structures without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks present; the code only declares types and schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; extensive use of type annotations and structured data definitions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict definitions, Union types, and imports for type annotations. It sets up a comprehensive schema for data validation and API interactions. No functions, executable logic, or dynamic code execution are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior are detected. All dependencies are standard or from well-known type extension libraries. The code appears to be a clean, well-structured set of type definitions intended for SDK or API client development.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains purely declarative type definitions and schemas for a boto3-compatible SDK for bedrock services. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware indicators are present. It is a standard set of structured data type declarations with no evident security risks.",
