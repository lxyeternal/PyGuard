  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any potential security concerns, inconsistencies, or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code defines type annotations and data schemas for a boto3-style SDK for Bedrock services.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data processing, no untrusted data handling, just type declarations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, consisting of TypedDicts, Union types, and imports for static typing. No executable logic or malicious payloads are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.95 (highly justified due to the nature of the code being a comprehensive schema for SDK data types).\n\n**Assessment:** The high risk score is appropriate given the extensive type definitions that could be used in various contexts, but no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Reports 2 & 3:**\n\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" with no further details.\n- **Implication:** No data to analyze; no code or logic provided.\n- **Security concerns:** None, as no code or data is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, identifying that this code defines type annotations for an SDK.\n- **Analysis & Flow:** Again, only static type definitions, no runtime logic or data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The report assigns a malware score of 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.95, which aligns with the nature of the code.\n\n**Assessment:** The high risk score is justified. These are standard type definitions, serving as static schemas for SDK interactions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is purely for data structure definitions for AWS SDK, with no runtime or executable logic.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secret handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Code Content:** Entirely composed of static type definitions, data schemas, and import statements for type annotations.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n- **Security Risks:** None present; the code is standard for SDK type definitions.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The high risk scores in Reports 1 and 4 are justified because they cover extensive SDK schemas, which could be misused if incorporated into malicious tooling, but the code itself is benign.\n- The other reports lack code or data to analyze, so their risk is zero.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.95 (due to the comprehensive schema definitions, which could be leveraged maliciously but are themselves benign)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. The high risk score reflects the potential misuse of extensive SDK schemas but does not indicate actual malicious behavior.",
