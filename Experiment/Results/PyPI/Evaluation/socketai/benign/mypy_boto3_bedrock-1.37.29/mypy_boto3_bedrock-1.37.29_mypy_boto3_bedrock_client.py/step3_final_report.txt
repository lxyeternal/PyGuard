  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for AWS Bedrock SDK, providing type safety and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, type hints, and conditional imports for compatibility; no runtime data processing.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external command execution, or untrusted data handling within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Method signatures and property definitions; no actual data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; standard SDK interface.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured SDK interface with type annotations, method overloads, and conditional imports for compatibility. It contains no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated logic. It primarily defines method signatures for API calls, with no runtime behavior or data handling. No signals of malicious intent or sabotage are present. The code aligns with standard SDK design patterns, emphasizing type safety and compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated SDK interface for AWS Bedrock, free of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. It poses minimal security risk, primarily related to the inherent nature of SDK interactions with cloud services, which are standard and expected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
