  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that this code provides type annotations and class definitions for the Bedrock AWS service SDK, mainly for type safety and IDE support.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data processing or external command execution; the code is primarily interface definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code is standard for an SDK wrapper, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a benign, well-structured SDK interface with no malware or sabotage is accurate. The confidence level of 0.9 is appropriate, and the malware score of 0 aligns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue:** The report simply states \"Empty response\" with no further analysis.\n- **Impact:** Insufficient information to evaluate, but given the context, no malicious activity is implied.\n- **Score:** Since there's no evidence of issues, the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly identifies the code as a type-safe SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data leaks or malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is typical for SDK definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is accurate; the malware score is 0, and the risk is minimal.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes that this is a standard SDK interface with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flow or external command execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns. The code appears auto-generated or standard SDK code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment; no malicious activity detected. Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, describing a structured SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a legitimate SDK interface, malware score of 0, risk very low.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely SDK interface definitions with no dynamic or executable payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports suggest obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious signals, the overall risk remains very low (~0.1 or less).\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK interface for AWS Bedrock.\n- No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- Method signatures, type annotations, and conditional imports are typical for SDKs aiming for compatibility and type safety.\n- No evidence of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the potential for misuse of presigned URLs or API calls, but no actual malicious activity observed)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate SDK interface code with no security concerns.",
