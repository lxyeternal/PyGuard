  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and client class definitions for AWS Bedrock SDK, mainly for type safety and IDE support. The code imports standard modules, AWS SDK components, and local modules. No runtime data processing or dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The code defines method signatures, properties, and overloads; no actual execution or data flow occurs here. No untrusted data is processed within this snippet.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code is a standard SDK interface with no runtime behavior.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a straightforward SDK interface with high confidence (0.9) that it is benign. Malware score is 0, obfuscated 0, and minimal security risk (0.1) due to potential misuse of `generate_presigned_url`, which is standard in SDKs.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity or security risk detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** No details provided (empty response). Cannot analyze.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No information to assess.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations and method definitions for the SDK client. Uses standard imports, type hints, and method signatures.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No actual data processing, only method signatures. No untrusted data handling or external command execution.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be auto-generated or standard SDK interface code.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious signals, malware, or sabotage detected. High confidence (0.95). The security risk remains very low (0.1).\n\n**Verdict:** Legitimate SDK interface, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, defining SDK interface with type annotations, properties, and overloads for paginators.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic or data processing; purely interface signatures.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is consistent with SDK design.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious behavior. High confidence (0.95). Security risk negligible.\n\n**Verdict:** Standard SDK code, safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, around 0.1, mainly due to the potential misuse of presigned URL generation or API access, which is standard for SDKs.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface for AWS Bedrock.**\n- **No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or backdoors.**\n- **No obfuscation or suspicious logic.**\n- **Potential security considerations are inherent to SDKs that interact with cloud services but are not malicious in themselves.**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (reflecting typical SDK exposure, not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, auto-generated SDK interface with no malicious or security-compromising elements. No further action needed.",
