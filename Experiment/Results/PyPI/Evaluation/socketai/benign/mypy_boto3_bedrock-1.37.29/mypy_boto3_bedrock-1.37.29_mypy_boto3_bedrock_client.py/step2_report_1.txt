  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** It correctly states that the code provides type annotations and client class definitions for AWS Bedrock, relying on standard Python modules, AWS SDK components, and custom type definitions. No issues here.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The report notes that the code mainly defines method signatures and type hints, with no actual runtime logic or data processing, which is accurate.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a straightforward SDK wrapper, with conditional imports for compatibility. No malicious signals detected.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is benign and purely a type-safe SDK interface is correct. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Reports 2 & 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Both are minimal or empty, but the provided summaries align with the previous analysis: these are SDK interface definitions with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external command executions are indicated.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Both correctly identify the code as a standard SDK interface with no security risks. Malware scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**Report 3 & 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, focusing on type annotations and method signatures for AWS SDK.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data exfiltration or malicious data handling.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution. The code is consistent with an SDK wrapper.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessments are accurate; the malware score of 0 and low security risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** The code is a well-structured, auto-generated SDK interface for AWS Bedrock, providing type annotations and method signatures. It does not execute external commands, handle untrusted data, or contain any obfuscated or malicious code.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both are absent. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** The overall security risk is minimal; the code does not process or leak data maliciously. The risk score can stay low (~0.1), primarily reflecting the fact that this is an SDK interface and not a runtime application.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — typical for SDK interface code, not a security concern.\n\n**Overall, the code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.**",
