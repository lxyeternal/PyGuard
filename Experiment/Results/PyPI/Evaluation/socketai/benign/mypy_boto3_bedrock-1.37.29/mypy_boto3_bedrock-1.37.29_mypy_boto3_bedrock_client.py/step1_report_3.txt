  "purpose": "Type annotations and method definitions for the Bedrock service client to facilitate type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, third-party libraries (botocore), and local module dependencies (paginator, type_defs). Method definitions with parameters unpacked from type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Methods that send data to AWS endpoints via API calls, presigned URL generation, or resource tagging/untagging. No explicit data leaks or external data collection shown.",
  "flows": "Input data from method parameters (unpacked type definitions) to AWS service calls via the boto3 client methods. No suspicious data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Method definitions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. Use of '...' as default for some parameters is consistent with documentation standards. No suspicious string operations or external network calls observed in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a boto3 client class with methods that correspond to AWS Bedrock service operations. It uses type annotations and overloads to facilitate type checking and autocomplete features. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden network activity within this code. The imports and method implementations are standard for a client SDK wrapper. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK interface for AWS Bedrock, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It functions as a type-safe wrapper around boto3 client methods, with no malicious behaviors identified.",
