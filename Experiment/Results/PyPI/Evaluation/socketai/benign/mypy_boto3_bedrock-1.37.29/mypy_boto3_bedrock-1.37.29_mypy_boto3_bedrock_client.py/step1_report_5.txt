{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the Bedrock AWS service, providing a structured interface for API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; property and method decorators; overload functions for pagination.",
  "sinks": "None identified. Methods only define interface signatures without executing or handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Method signatures indicate source inputs via parameters, but no actual data flow, processing, or untrusted data handling occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with type annotations for the AWS Bedrock service. It contains class definitions, property methods, and overloads for paginators, all consistent with typical SDK design. No code executes external commands, handles untrusted input, or performs malicious actions. The presence of extensive type definitions and docstrings suggests an auto-generated or well-maintained SDK module. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate SDK interface for AWS Bedrock with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It provides type annotations and method signatures for API interactions without executing any logic or processing untrusted data.",
