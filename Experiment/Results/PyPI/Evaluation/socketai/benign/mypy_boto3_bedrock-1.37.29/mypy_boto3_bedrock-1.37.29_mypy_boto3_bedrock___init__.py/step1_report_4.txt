{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface module for the bedrock service, providing imports and re-exports of classes and paginators for use in other parts of a project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), standard library imports, and inline documentation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed. The code primarily consists of imports, documentation, and re-exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes and paginators from local modules and defining an alias and __all__ for exports. The inline documentation guides users on how to instantiate and use the client and paginators. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. No network or system interactions are triggered by this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured module for a Python SDK or client library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is mainly for organization and documentation, with no evident malware or security concerns.",
