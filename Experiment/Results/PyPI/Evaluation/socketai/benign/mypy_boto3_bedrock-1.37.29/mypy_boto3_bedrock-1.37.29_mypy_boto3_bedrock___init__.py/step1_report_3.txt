{
  "purpose": "Main interface module for bedrock service, providing imports and aliases for various paginator classes and client initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator), static string assignments (__all__ and docstring), and a code block demonstrating usage.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; the code mainly involves static imports, variable assignments, and documentation.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or sinks; the code primarily defines structure and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward import statements, variable assignments, and documentation. It defines a module that imports various paginator classes and creates an alias 'Client' for 'BedrockClient'. The usage example is purely illustrative. No signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are identified. The code appears to be a standard SDK-like interface setup for a service.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign module setting up SDK interfaces for a service. It contains no malware, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. Overall security risk is very low.",
