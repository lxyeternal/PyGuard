  "purpose": "Main interface for bedrock service, providing access to various AWS Bedrock client and paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator). No external data sources or input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations. No output or network communication code present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules and re-exports them. It includes a usage example in a docstring, which shows standard AWS SDK usage for pagination. No external data inputs, network calls, or sensitive data handling is present. No suspicious or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward module for importing and exporting classes related to the AWS Bedrock service. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this fragment.",
