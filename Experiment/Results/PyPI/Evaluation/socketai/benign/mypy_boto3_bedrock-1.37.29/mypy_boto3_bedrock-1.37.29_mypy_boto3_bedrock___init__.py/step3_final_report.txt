  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python module providing an organized interface for AWS Bedrock SDK components, mainly through class imports, aliasing, and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), class definitions, and documentation strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output, no network activity, no secrets or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class definitions without dynamic data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static SDK interface layer with clear import/export structure, inline documentation, and no dynamic or insecure behaviors. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code. The purpose is purely organizational, serving as a wrapper for SDK classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
