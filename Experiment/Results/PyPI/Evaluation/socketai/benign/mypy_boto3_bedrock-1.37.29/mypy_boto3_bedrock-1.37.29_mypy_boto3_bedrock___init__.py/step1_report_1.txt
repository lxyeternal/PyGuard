{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for interacting with the AWS Bedrock service by importing necessary classes, defining a client alias, and exporting symbols for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from local package (.client, .paginator), static string definitions for paginator names, and documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only imports modules, defines an alias, and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no input handling or data processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code consists of standard import/export patterns and inline documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward interface module with standard Python import/export syntax. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. It only imports classes, defines an alias, and exposes them for external use. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no input/output handling that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign interface layer for AWS Bedrock SDK components with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
