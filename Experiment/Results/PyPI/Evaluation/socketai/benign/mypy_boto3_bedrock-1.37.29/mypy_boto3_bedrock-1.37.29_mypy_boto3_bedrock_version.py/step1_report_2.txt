  "anomalies": "Simple version assignment, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version string assignment and a copyright notice. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious constructs. The version string appears to be static and hardcoded, which is typical for package versioning. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign and standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
