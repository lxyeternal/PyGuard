  "purpose": "Defines a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The line setting __version__ from a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright year in the comment that is in the future (2025), which may indicate inconsistency or placeholder text but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a single variable assignment setting __version__ to a static string. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The only notable aspect is the copyright year being in the future relative to the current date, which could suggest an oversight or placeholder but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to declare version information. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
