  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - It includes a copyright notice.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The version string is static and hardcoded.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No code injection, obfuscated code, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or external data handling.\n   - The only anomaly noted is the future year (2025) in the comment, which is likely a placeholder or oversight, not malicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - Obfuscation scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - The only minor note is the future copyright year, but this doesn't impact security.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n   - No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, standard, and contains no security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent with the actual code content.",
