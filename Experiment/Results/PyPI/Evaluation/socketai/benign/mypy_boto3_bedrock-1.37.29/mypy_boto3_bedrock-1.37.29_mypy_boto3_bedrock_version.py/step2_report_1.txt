  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.\n- No data flows, external calls, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- The code is static, minimal, and standard for version declaration.\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year being in the future (2025), which is likely a placeholder or oversight, not malicious.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Correctly identifies the code as benign, straightforward, and no malicious activity.  \n- Confidence is 1, which is appropriate.  \n- No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Also correctly states the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns.  \n- Confidence is 1, which is reasonable.  \n- No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Notes the future copyright year (2025) as an anomaly, which is accurate.  \n- No malicious behavior is implied or detected.  \n- Confidence is 0.9, which is appropriate given the minor anomaly.  \n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Confirms the code is standard and benign.  \n- Confidence is 1.  \n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same conclusion: benign, minimal, no malicious activity.  \n- Confidence is 1.  \n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking scores:\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is correct given the code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are 0, matching the benign nature.\n- The reasoning is consistent across reports.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a simple, static version string assignment with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year, which does not imply any security concern.\n\n### My recommended scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the future year anomaly, though it's not a security risk, just a potential inconsistency)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is entirely benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores in the reports are appropriate; I would just slightly adjust the overall risk score to 0.1 to reflect the minor anomaly.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious behavior.  \n- The scores given are reasonable, with a minor adjustment for the future copyright year anomaly.",
