  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Static assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), likely a placeholder but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string with a copyright notice. No inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external interactions are present. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor anomaly of the future year does not affect security assessment. Overall, the package is safe for use.",
