  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a copyright notice.\n   - There are no inputs, data processing, external calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - The only minor point is the third report noting the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, this is likely a placeholder or oversight, not a security concern.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - Confidence scores are high (mostly 1, with one at 0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports justify a risk score above 0.5; all appropriately assign 0, indicating no security risk.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are cautious and accurate.\n   - The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static assignment of a version string with a copyright notice. There are no inputs, outputs, external interactions, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify this and assign zero risk and malware scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, with no security concerns.",
