  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the Bedrock service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions. Class methods like 'paginate' which accept unpacked request parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods are potential sinks where untrusted input (via **kwargs) can be used to manipulate pagination, but in this context, they are just type-annotated wrappers around AWS SDK functionality.",
  "flows": "Input (**kwargs) flows into 'paginate' methods which invoke the underlying Paginator with unpacked parameters, returning PageIterator objects containing response data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. The code structure is straightforward, serving as a type-safe wrapper around boto3 paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes for different AWS Bedrock API operations, using conditional type imports and runtime type checking. Each paginator class inherits from a generic Paginator with specified response types, with 'paginate' methods accepting request parameters via **kwargs. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The code's purpose is to provide type annotations and class structures for safer, type-checked pagination. The import statements and class definitions are standard and align with boto3's design. No unusual behavior or malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of class wrappers for boto3 pagination, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions solely as a type-safe interface layer, with no suspicious elements.",
