{
  "purpose": "The code defines paginators for the 'bedrock' service in boto3, providing type annotations and structure for paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads input through method parameters (**kwargs) in the 'paginate' methods, and via imported type definitions for request parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods are sinks where untrusted input data (kwargs) could potentially influence behavior, but they are standard paginator calls; no data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input kwargs into the 'paginate' methods, which call the underlying Paginator class with the unpacked parameters; responses flow back as PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. The code adheres to standard patterns for boto3 paginators with type annotations. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines subclasses of Paginator for each API operation, with type annotations for request parameters and responses. Each class has a 'paginate' method with proper type annotations, and all follow consistent patterns. No suspicious data handling, external network activity, or code execution is present. The type definitions are imported from local modules, which appears standard. The use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is normal. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for boto3, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. It serves as a type-safe wrapper for pagination in the 'bedrock' service, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
