  "purpose": "Define paginators for various Bedrock service API calls with type annotations to ensure type safety and facilitate autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration and request parameters via **kwargs in the paginate methods. Imports from sys, typing, and botocore.paginate.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods could potentially process untrusted input if external data is passed through the kwargs, but there are no direct data sinks such as network connections or file writes.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from **kwargs into paginate methods, which then return PageIterator objects. No untrusted data is propagated into external sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is standard type-annotated class definitions for paginators. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines paginator classes for a set of Bedrock service API calls, utilizing type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility. The classes inherit from a generic Paginator base and override the paginate method with appropriate type annotations. No external input handling or system interactions suggest malicious intent. The code appears to be standard SDK interface scaffolding with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of typed paginator classes for the boto3 Bedrock client, with no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is designed solely for type safety and code completion support. The malware score is low, and the security risk is minimal.",
