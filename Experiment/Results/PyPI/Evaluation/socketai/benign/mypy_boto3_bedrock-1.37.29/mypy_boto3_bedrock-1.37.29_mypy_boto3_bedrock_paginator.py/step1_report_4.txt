{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginators for the Bedrock service client in boto3, facilitating type-checked pagination over various AWS Bedrock API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (via **kwargs), type definitions imported from 'type_defs', and potentially from the paginator's internal mechanisms. No untrusted external input sources or user input are explicitly handled.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or output data directly; the main concern would be potential misuse of paginated data if downstream code mishandles responses, but the code itself does not perform data leakage or unsafe actions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling 'paginate' methods with kwargs, which are typed unpacked, and returning PageIterator objects for responses. No untrusted data flows from external sources into sensitive sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code appears standard for a boto3 paginator stub implementation, with conditional type handling for different Python versions. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes inheriting from a base Paginator class, with type annotations for request and response types. Each class includes a 'paginate' method that unpacks kwargs with precise type annotations. Type checking is handled via 'TYPE_CHECKING' conditional blocks, ensuring type hints do not affect runtime. No external data sources, insecure code execution, or malicious behavior are evident. The overall structure follows standard boto3 stub patterns for type safety and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured type annotation and stub implementation for boto3 Bedrock paginators. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe for use, assuming the imported type definitions are correct and from trusted sources.",
