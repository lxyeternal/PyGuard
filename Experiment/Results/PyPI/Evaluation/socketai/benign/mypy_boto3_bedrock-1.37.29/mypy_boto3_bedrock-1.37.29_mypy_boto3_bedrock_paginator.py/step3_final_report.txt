  "flows": "kwargs into 'paginate' calls, responses flow back as PageIterator",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard boto3 paginator classes with type annotations, inheriting from Paginator, with 'paginate' methods accepting kwargs and returning PageIterator. No external data leaks, code injection, or malicious activity. The passing of kwargs is typical SDK behavior and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK stub implementation for boto3 paginators, with no signs of malware or security risks. The potential misuse of kwargs is inherent in SDK design but does not constitute malicious activity.",
