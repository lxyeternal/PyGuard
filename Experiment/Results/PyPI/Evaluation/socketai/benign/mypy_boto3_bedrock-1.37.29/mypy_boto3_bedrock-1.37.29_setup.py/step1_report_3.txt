{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-bedrock package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; no other data sources or user input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that process untrusted input; setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "N/A, as no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'Path' from pathlib and 'setup' from setuptools, then reads a README.md file to assign to LONG_DESCRIPTION. It calls setup() with static parameters defining package info, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic or malicious code patterns, no user input handling, no network activity, nor any suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be a standard, legitimate package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
