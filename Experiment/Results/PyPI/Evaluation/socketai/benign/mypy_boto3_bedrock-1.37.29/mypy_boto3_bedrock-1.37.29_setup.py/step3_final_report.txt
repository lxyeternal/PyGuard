  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python module 'mypy-boto3-bedrock'.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external network calls; no data leaks or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from local files and hardcoded strings to setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local README.md for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs, and calls setup() with fixed arguments. There are no dynamic executions, network operations, or obfuscated elements. The code's structure and content are typical for Python package configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, well-structured, and free from malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All prior reports correctly identified its safe and standard nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the code's static and transparent design.",
