  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-bedrock package, used for installing the package and its metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package and metadata declarations; import statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The script is a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, reads a README file for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup with package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are used. There are no network operations, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The structure and content align with typical Python package setup scripts. No anomalies, no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration file for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
