  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-bedrock package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, static package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "Static metadata definitions do not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, reads a local file for description, and calls setup() with package info. All data used is static or local. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. The code follows typical setup.py conventions without suspicious constructs or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
