  "purpose": "The script sets up the package 'mypy-boto3-bedrock' for distribution, defining its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; accesses package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or code; no network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content to assign to LONG_DESCRIPTION, then passes static arguments to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file for the long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic code executions, external data inputs, or suspicious behaviors present. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or include obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
