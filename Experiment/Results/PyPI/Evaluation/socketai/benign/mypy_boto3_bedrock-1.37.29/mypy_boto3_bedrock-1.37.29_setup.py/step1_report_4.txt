{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-bedrock package to configure installation parameters and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, reading environment variables via setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable outputs or dangerous commands.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow identified; data flows from static file read (README.md) to package metadata, which is safe.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard setup script structure. The code reads a local file for documentation, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path and setup, reads a local README.md file for description, and calls setup() with package configuration parameters. All actions are typical for a Python package setup script. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior. No external network access, credential handling, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. It performs configuration and dependency setup for a package named mypy-boto3-bedrock. No anomalies or malware indicators were detected.",
