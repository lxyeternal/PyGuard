  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Python setup script for packaging, using setuptools.\n- It reads a local README.md for the long description.\n- It defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network calls, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code is static, well-structured, and typical for a Python package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. All reports agree the code is benign and standard.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Any logical or security flaws?**  \n  None identified. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The code is static, reads only local files, and performs no network or dynamic operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n- The package setup process is standard.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No need to adjust scores.\n- The detailed analysis confirms the absence of security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, safe package setup script with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAfter thorough review, I concur with all reports. The code is benign, standard, and free from vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
