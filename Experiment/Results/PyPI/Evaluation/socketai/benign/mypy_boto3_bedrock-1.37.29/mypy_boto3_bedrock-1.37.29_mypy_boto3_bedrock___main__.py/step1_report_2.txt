{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entrypoint that outputs package information or version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' in sys.argv; if present, calls print_version() which writes version info to stdout; otherwise, calls print_info() which writes package info to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The output is static, non-malicious information. No external data fetching or code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles command-line arguments and outputs static package metadata or version info. It imports only sys and uses straightforward control flow. No input validation or external calls pose security concerns. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors identified. The code performs simple I/O operations with predefined strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script that provides package info and version details. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe utility script.",
