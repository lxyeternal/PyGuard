  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version number.\n   - It uses only the standard library (`sys`) and performs straightforward operations:\n     - Checks for `--version` argument.\n     - Prints static info or version to stdout.\n   - No dynamic code, external data fetching, or user input influencing behavior beyond argument presence.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is benign, static, and straightforward.\n   - No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n   - The logic is sound, and the data output is purely informational.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature, clarity, and lack of malicious or obfuscated code.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks identified; the script is static and safe.\n   - The scores given in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - None identified. The code is a simple informational CLI utility.\n   - No assumptions or speculative vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious or suspicious behavior present.                                |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.                         |\n| Security Risk   | 0            | No security issues or vulnerabilities evident.                              |\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a benign, static CLI utility.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, with no security concerns.",
