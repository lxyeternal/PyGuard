  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the reported issues, their reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**1. Code verification:**\n- The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on a command-line argument.\n- No dynamic code execution, no external network calls, no credentials, no obfuscation.\n- The code is static, simple, and does not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n**2. Logical flaws or issues:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the script is benign and only outputs static information.\n- No issues or flaws are evident in the logic or implementation.\n\n**3. Score assessments:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all scores are 0, no justification needed. The code poses no security risk.\n\n**5. Malware scoring:**\n- No malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score should remain 0.\n\n**6. Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- The code does not accept user input beyond checking for '--version', and it only outputs static info.\n- No vulnerabilities or assumptions are present.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- All reports are consistent with each other and accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The code is a minimal, static CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No obfuscation, external dependencies, or dynamic operations.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is entirely safe. The scores are appropriately low, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- Confirm that the report reflects the code's benign nature accurately.\n\n**Note:** If future code includes dynamic operations, external calls, or obfuscation, re-evaluate accordingly.",
