  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version number based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Input: sys.argv (argument '--version') -> Output: static strings printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and uses only standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for '--version' in command-line arguments; if present, it prints the version number, otherwise it prints package info. It contains no dynamic data fetching, no external calls, no user input beyond argument checking, and no suspicious patterns. The code is minimal, clear, and performs only static output. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The logic is sound, and the data output is purely informational. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence. The code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It is safe and performs only informational output. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
