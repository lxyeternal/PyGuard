  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational output about boto3 Bedrock stubs and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output messages",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write, which outputs package info or version data",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers output functions that write static information to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the outputs are static informational messages",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles CLI commands to output package info and version. It reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and outputs static strings via sys.stdout.write. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input processing beyond argument presence check, and no network activity or data leakage mechanisms. The code structure is simple, with functions for output and a main control flow. No obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior, and no malicious logic are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package info and version details. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
