{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entrypoint that outputs package information or version details for a Python package related to boto3 Bedrock, providing documentation links and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to sys.stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line argument) is checked for '--version'; if present, it triggers output of version info; otherwise, it outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No external network calls or code execution of untrusted data. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI tool that prints static package information or version details. It uses standard library functions with no dynamic or unsafe operations. No user input is used to influence behavior beyond checking for a specific argument. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script that outputs package information and version details. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security issues.",
