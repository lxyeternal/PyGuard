  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on a command-line argument.\n   - It imports only the standard library (`sys`), uses straightforward control flow, and performs no dynamic operations, external data fetching, or code execution.\n   - The output is static, predefined strings with no user-influenced logic beyond checking for `'--version'`.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, code obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed.\n   - No network calls, external data access, or environment manipulations.\n   - The code's purpose is purely informational.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), indicating certainty in their assessments.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is justified given the static, read-only nature of the code and lack of any security concerns.\n\n5. **Potential for Misinterpretation or Hidden Risks:**\n   - The code is very simple; there's no evidence of hidden malicious logic.\n   - The only possible concern could be if the code was modified to include malicious payloads, but based on the current version, this is not the case.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign CLI utility with no security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Summary of my conclusion:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.** The code is safe, static, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.",
