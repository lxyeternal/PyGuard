  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static package info or version number based on command-line argument '--version'.\n   - No dynamic code, external data fetching, or user input influencing behavior beyond a simple argument check.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is minimal, readable, and uses standard library functions only.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that the script only outputs static information and performs no dangerous operations.\n   - No discrepancies or logical flaws are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the static, safe nature of the script.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is entirely benign, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified and inconsistent with the findings.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity or intent is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static nature of the code.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis.\n   - No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
