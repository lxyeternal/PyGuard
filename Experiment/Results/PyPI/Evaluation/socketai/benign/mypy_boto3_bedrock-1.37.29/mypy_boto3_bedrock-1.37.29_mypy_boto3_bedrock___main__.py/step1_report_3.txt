{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entry point that provides package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output, and the imported sys module.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output; sys.argv for input data.",
  "flows": "User input via sys.argv is checked for '--version'; if present, print_version() is called, otherwise print_info() is called. Output flows to sys.stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code appears straightforward and only handles displaying package info and version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and defines functions to print package info and version. The main() function checks command-line arguments for '--version' and decides which info to display. All data output is static and predefined, with no dynamic or external data fetched. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network connections, file modifications, or environment variable manipulations. The code structure is simple and standard for CLI utilities. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The code strictly performs informational output, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package information and version number. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe for use.",
