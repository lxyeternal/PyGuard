{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literals used across the Bedrock service package, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module; type annotation assignments for Literal types throughout the code.",
  "sinks": "No external data input or untrusted data sources; the code primarily defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "None, as the code consists solely of type definitions without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward type aliasing and constant definitions without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports Literal from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines numerous Literal type aliases for enumerations used in Bedrock service. All definitions are static, clear, and serve type hinting purposes. There are no dynamic or runtime behaviors, no input handling, and no external network or file operations. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is well-structured for maintainability and clarity, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign collection of type aliases for string literals used in a Python SDK or library. It does not perform any runtime actions, data processing, or external interactions. Therefore, it poses no security threat or malicious behavior risk.",
