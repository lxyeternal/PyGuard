  "purpose": "Define and export Python type literals for various AWS and custom service identifiers, statuses, and categories used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions assigning Literal types to various identifiers, statuses, and categories.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to security vulnerabilities; the code only defines static type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely declares constants for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs observed. The code includes conditional import for compatibility and static literals.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of type aliases using Python's Literal for static type checking, mainly for AWS service names, statuses, and categories. It includes a version-dependent import of Literal from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. There are no dynamic or runtime code executions, no input handling, no network or file operations, and no secret or credential handling. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The overall structure is purely static type alias definitions intended for code clarity and type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a static, well-structured set of type aliases intended for type hinting. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no suspicious code. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
