  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, purpose, and the provided security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of type alias definitions using `Literal` for various string enumerations related to AWS and Bedrock services.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` from `typing` or `typing_extensions` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or runtime logic.\n- No untrusted input, secrets, credentials, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The purpose is to facilitate static type checking, documentation, and code clarity.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define type annotations for Bedrock literals.\n- Findings: No data flow, no anomalies, purely static definitions.\n- Conclusion: Benign, well-structured, no security risks.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely static type aliasing.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Export type literals for AWS identifiers and statuses.\n- Findings: No data flow, no malicious activity, static constants.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Define string literals for the Bedrock library.\n- Findings: No data handling, no runtime logic, purely static.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe for static analysis.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Define literals for AWS and Bedrock SDK.\n- Findings: Static definitions, no dynamic or runtime code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, purely type annotations.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for AWS services and statuses.\n- Findings: Static, no data flow, no external interactions.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static type aliasing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` is standard for compatibility.\n- The code does not handle any data input, secrets, or perform any runtime operations.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, the code is a benign, well-structured set of type alias definitions intended solely for static type checking and documentation purposes. There are no security risks, malware, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden logic)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk; purely static type definitions)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, non-malicious, and appropriate for its intended purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that such type definition modules are not modified or extended with dynamic code in production environments. But based on the current content, no issues are present.",
