  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literals and statuses using Python's Literal type for static type checking.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only declares static type aliases for string constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is purely static type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, then declares numerous string literal type aliases for AWS services, statuses, categories, etc. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or external dependencies. The purpose is to facilitate static type checking and documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type annotations. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its static and safe nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified.",
