{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various literal string types used across a Python SDK or codebase related to AWS services and bedrock.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions using Literal, imported based on Python version; no input reading beyond standard type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data handling present; type definitions are static.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; these are purely static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; the code solely consists of type alias declarations and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various string literal types for use in type annotations, ensuring type safety across a larger codebase. It conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version. The list of literals includes AWS service names, statuses, actions, and other enumerations. The code is purely declarative, with no runtime behavior, input/output handling, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malware are present. The purpose appears to be purely to provide type safety and documentation aid for developers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for static type checking, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. Its purpose is to improve code correctness and readability.",
