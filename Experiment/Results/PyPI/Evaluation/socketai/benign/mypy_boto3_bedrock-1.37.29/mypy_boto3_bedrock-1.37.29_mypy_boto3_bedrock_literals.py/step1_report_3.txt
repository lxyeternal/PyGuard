  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literals used in the boto3 bedrock service library to enable type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "String literals assigned to variables, imports from standard and typing_extensions modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code is purely declarative with no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data input/output; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward type alias definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. It then declares numerous variables as Literal types with specific string options, serving as type hints for the boto3 bedrock library. No user input, external data, or network activity is present. The content is purely declarative type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code’s purpose is to improve type safety and code clarity, with no apparent security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type annotations for literals used in a boto3 library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. The code is well-structured, straightforward, and solely intended for type hinting purposes.",
