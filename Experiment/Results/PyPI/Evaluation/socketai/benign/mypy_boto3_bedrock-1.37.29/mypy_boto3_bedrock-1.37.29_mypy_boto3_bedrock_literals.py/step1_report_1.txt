  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal types used in the boto3 bedrock service module.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing/extensions; string literals defining types and constants",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or to any sensitive operation; the code is solely defining constants and type aliases",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines numerous string literal types for use in type annotations. It only contains type definitions and string constants with no runtime logic or data handling. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious constructs. The purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking and documentation. The initial import and version check are standard practices, and the large set of literals are straightforward enumerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign set of type alias definitions for boto3 bedrock service literals. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It appears to be a well-structured, standard module for type annotations with no security risks.",
