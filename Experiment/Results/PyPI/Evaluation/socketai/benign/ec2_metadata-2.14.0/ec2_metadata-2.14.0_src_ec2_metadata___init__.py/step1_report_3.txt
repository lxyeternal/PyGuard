{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for retrieving EC2 instance metadata from the AWS metadata service, including security credentials, network info, and instance details.",
  "sources": "Requests to the local metadata service at 169.254.169.254, including GET and PUT requests for tokens, and data fetched from URLs like /latest/meta-data/ and /latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document.",
  "sinks": "The code accesses sensitive metadata such as IAM info, security credentials, instance identity, and network interface data; these could leak if exposed externally or misused.",
  "flows": "The code fetches data from the local metadata service, processes JSON responses or text, and provides property-based access to various metadata items. No external or untrusted data is propagated to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard AWS metadata API endpoints and requests. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is present. No network communication occurs outside the local metadata service, and data is not transmitted externally.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation for accessing EC2 instance metadata using requests.Session with token management for version 2 metadata service. It includes multiple cached properties for efficiency, proper error handling for 404 responses, and no evidence of malicious behavior or hidden functionality. The code does not perform any suspicious network communication beyond local metadata fetching, nor does it handle or store untrusted input for external use. It is consistent with a typical, benign AWS utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for fetching EC2 instance metadata without any signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It uses standard APIs, manages tokens securely, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
