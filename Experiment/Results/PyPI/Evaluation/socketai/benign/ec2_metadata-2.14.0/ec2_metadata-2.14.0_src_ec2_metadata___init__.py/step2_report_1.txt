  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard AWS EC2 metadata access utility with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code interacts with the AWS metadata service, uses token management, and caches data. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident. The low security risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard AWS metadata interactions, token handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is a typical EC2 metadata client, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores and conclusions are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the retrieval of sensitive metadata, but finds no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The mention of sensitive data is accurate, but no malicious intent or suspicious behavior is observed. The risk score is slightly lower, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, confirming the code's standard behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious signals detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, noting standard AWS EC2 metadata interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code, which is a typical EC2 metadata client.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern given the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, standard AWS metadata access code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and well-justified. No further adjustments are necessary. The code is a standard, benign AWS EC2 metadata utility with no supply chain security concerns.",
