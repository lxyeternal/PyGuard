  "purpose": "Define exception aliases for the google.cloud package and handle optional gRPC dependency import.",
  "sources": "Import of google.api_core.exceptions; conditional import of grpc._channel._Rendezvous",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and aliasing only",
  "flows": "Import statements to alias definitions; no data flow or execution beyond setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception aliasing and optional import handling",
  "analysis": "The code sets up exception aliases for the google.cloud package, importing exceptions from google.api_core and conditionally importing _Rendezvous from grpc._channel. It includes a try-except block to handle missing grpc dependency. The code is static, with no data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic execution. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. It functions as boilerplate setup code for exception handling, with standard practices and no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard setup for exception aliasing and optional dependency handling. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified, with malware, obfuscated, and risk scores all at 0. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe and poses no threat.",
