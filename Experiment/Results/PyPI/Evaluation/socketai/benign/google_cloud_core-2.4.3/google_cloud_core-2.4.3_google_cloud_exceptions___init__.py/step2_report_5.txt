  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code in question is a straightforward module that defines exception aliases and handles optional gRPC import for the google.cloud package.\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, standard boilerplate, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- The import handling, aliasing, and licensing comments are typical for such modules.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- No signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The exception aliases are standard and directly map to existing exceptions.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n- No anomalies, security risks, or obfuscation are detected across reports.\n- The import fallback for `_Rendezvous` is handled gracefully, which is good practice.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The code is purely for exception aliasing and import management, with no indication of any security concern.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code is a benign, standard setup for exception handling within a Python package.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe exception aliasing module with no security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
