  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and aliases for Google Cloud API errors, and handle gRPC import fallback.",
  "sources": "Import statements (__future__, google.api_core.exceptions, grpc._channel), exception alias assignments",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data outputs that process untrusted input; mainly alias assignments and imports",
  "flows": "Imports and alias assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up exception aliases and handles optional gRPC import, which is standard for library setup. It includes necessary imports and fallback logic without executing any untrusted code or external data processing. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for exception handling within a Google Cloud Python package. It contains no malicious intent, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a benign, boilerplate configuration file.",
