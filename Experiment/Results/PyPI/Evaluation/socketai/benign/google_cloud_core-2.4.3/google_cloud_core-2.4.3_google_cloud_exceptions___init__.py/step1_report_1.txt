  "purpose": "Define custom exception aliases and handle gRPC import for the google.cloud package.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially the 'grpc._channel' import and exceptions from 'google.api_core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or output. No data leaks or insecure actions are apparent.",
  "flows": "Import sources are used to define exception classes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward exception aliasing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception class aliases for the google.cloud package and handles optional gRPC import. It includes a try-except block for safe import handling. No user input, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The code is standard for setting up exception handling and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for exception handling and import management within a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
