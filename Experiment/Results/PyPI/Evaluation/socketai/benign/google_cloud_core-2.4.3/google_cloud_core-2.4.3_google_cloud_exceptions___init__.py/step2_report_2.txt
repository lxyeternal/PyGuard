  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily about defining exception aliases and handling optional gRPC import.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or secret handling are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues & Risks:**\n   - The code is standard for setting up exception handling within a Python package.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n   - The import handling with try-except is typical for optional dependencies.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as there's no evidence of security issues.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Oversights:**\n   - No issues are evident in the code.\n   - The logic and reasoning in all reports are sound.\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign setup for exception aliasing and optional import handling in a Python package. The reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nNo changes needed. The code and reports are aligned, and the security assessment is correct.",
