  "purpose": "Define custom exception aliases and handle gRPC import for the google.cloud package.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and google.api_core.exceptions, conditional import of grpc._channel._Rendezvous.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; code primarily sets up exception aliases and handles import logic.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; import statements and alias assignments are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code appears to be standard library import and aliasing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, conditionally imports a gRPC class, and sets up exception aliases. It includes licensing comments and pylint disables. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The import handling is straightforward, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for exception handling in a Google Cloud Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
