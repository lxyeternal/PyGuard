{
  "purpose": "Wrapper for managing Google Cloud long-running operations, including protobuf parsing, type registration, and polling mechanisms.",
  "sources": "External API requests via gRPC and HTTP, protobuf serialization/deserialization, type registration functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data flows from protobufs and API responses into internal state variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from protobuf/JSON inputs through parsing functions into class attributes; API calls update operation status.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-documented SDK component implementing protobuf handling, type registration, and polling for long-running operations. It uses established patterns without obfuscation or malicious code. No external data leaks or suspicious behaviors are present. The protobuf parsing and API interactions are typical for such SDKs, and the code structure is transparent and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Google Cloud SDK components for long-running operations. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The low malware and obfuscation scores (0), along with a minimal security risk (~0.1-0.2), are justified. Overall, it is safe and trustworthy.",
