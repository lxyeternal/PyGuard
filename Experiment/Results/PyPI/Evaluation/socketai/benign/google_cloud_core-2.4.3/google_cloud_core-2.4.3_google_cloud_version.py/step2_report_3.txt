  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Context:**\n   - The code is purely a license header and a version assignment (`__version__ = \"2.4.3\"`).\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic code.\n   - The license comments are standard boilerplate and do not contain any executable or suspicious code.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, standard boilerplate, and poses no security risk.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), and all indicate zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Correctly assigned as 0 in all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly assigned as 0; no obfuscation present.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Correctly assigned as 0; the code is benign.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Overlooked Aspects:**\n   - Given the simplicity of the code, there are no hidden or embedded malicious behaviors.\n   - The license comments are standard and do not pose any security threat.\n   - The version string is static and does not influence security.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a typical open-source license header and version declaration with no security concerns.",
