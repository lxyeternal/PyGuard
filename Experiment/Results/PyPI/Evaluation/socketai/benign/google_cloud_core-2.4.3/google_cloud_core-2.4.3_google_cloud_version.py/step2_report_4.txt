  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippets are purely license comments and a static version assignment (`__version__ = \"2.4.3\"`).\n- No input/output, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign and standard boilerplate.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are very minimal, typical for open-source package metadata.\n- The license comments are standard and do not contain any executable code or embedded instructions.\n- The version string is a static assignment with no external influence or dynamic behavior.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence level is 1, reflecting high certainty.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- There are no embedded or hidden malicious elements.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for open-source projects.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reasoning is sound.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is entirely benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is a standard license header and version declaration with no security implications. All reports correctly identify it as benign.",
