{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata for a Python package, specifically defining the version number.",
  "sources": "The source is the assignment of __version__ with a string value.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data processing or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is a simple assignment operation from a string literal to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code includes license information and a version variable assignment. It is standard boilerplate for a package's __init__.py or metadata file. No inputs, outputs, or malicious constructs are present. The code is static and does not perform any runtime operations or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard snippet used for defining package version metadata. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
