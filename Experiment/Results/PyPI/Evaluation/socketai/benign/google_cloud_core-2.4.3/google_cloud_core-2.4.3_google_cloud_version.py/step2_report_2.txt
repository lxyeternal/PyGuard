  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports identify the code as a license header and version declaration, with no embedded functions, data flows, or external interactions.\n- The code snippets are static, straightforward, and typical for open-source Python packages.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious code are detected in any of the reports.\n- The confidence level across all reports is perfect (1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Review of individual scores:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and un-obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- Since the code is only a license header and version variable assignment, there are no dynamic or external elements to evaluate.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, and their conclusions are justified.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code snippet.\n- No changes are necessary; the code is benign.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, benign license header and version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
