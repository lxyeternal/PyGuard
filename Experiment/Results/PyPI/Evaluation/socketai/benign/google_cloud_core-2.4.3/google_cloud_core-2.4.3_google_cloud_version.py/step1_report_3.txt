{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version identifier for a Python package or module, likely for version control and package management purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines a string variable '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could leak.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists; the code simply assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is a standard license header and version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The initial lines include licensing comments and a version variable declaration. No external data handling, no execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. The license comments are standard boilerplate. The version variable is straightforward and typical for Python packages. No obfuscated or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of license comments and a version string assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
