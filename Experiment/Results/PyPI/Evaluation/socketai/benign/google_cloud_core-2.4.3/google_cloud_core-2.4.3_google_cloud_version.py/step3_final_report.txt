  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and defines the package version.",
  "sources": "The static comment block (license header) and the assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment and comments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and a static version variable assignment. There are no functions, data processing, external data sources, or dynamic behaviors. The comments are standard boilerplate, and the version string is a simple static assignment. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence. The code is typical for open-source package metadata and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license header and version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and justified, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
