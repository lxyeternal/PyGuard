  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard API connection management, environment variables, client info, headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into headers, URL construction, network requests. Response parsing is standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Uses deprecation warnings benignly.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical, well-structured API client library. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low). This seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with environment variables influencing URL selection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Environment variables affect URL building; request headers and parameters are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of environment variables for URL switching is standard but could be misused if environment is compromised.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or exfiltration. The code is standard for SDKs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API connection, environment variables, headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into URL and request headers; network requests are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Environment variables are used for configuration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK code, benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Connection management, environment variables, headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into request setup and execution.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of environment variables for URL switching is standard but could be exploited if environment is maliciously set.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, environment variables for URL switching.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard request flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Same as above, environment variables are a common configuration method.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports is reasonable, reflecting low security risk due to environment variable reliance, which is standard practice but could be misused if environment is compromised.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- No report indicates any signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The use of environment variables for URL switching is standard but should be monitored in secure environments.\n- The deprecation warnings are benign and do not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments. The code appears to be a legitimate, standard SDK implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores. The code is safe and well-structured.",
