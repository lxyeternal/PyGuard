{
  "purpose": "This code manages API connections to Google Cloud services, handling request setup, headers, URL construction, and environment-based configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for URL switching, client info for user agent, input parameters for URL and headers, request data.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request execution, URL formation, header population, response parsing.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence URL selection; request data flows into HTTP request; response data is processed or returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns. Use of environment variables for configuration is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured SDK component for API communication, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or data exfiltration. Use of deprecation warnings and environment variables is typical and benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 reflects standard configuration flexibility, not an actual vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for API connections, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
