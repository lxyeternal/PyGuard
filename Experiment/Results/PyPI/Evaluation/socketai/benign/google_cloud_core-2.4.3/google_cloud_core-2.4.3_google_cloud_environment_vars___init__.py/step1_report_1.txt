  "purpose": "Define environment variable names used in google-cloud for configuration and implicit behavior control.",
  "sources": "Environment variables read by the application at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external outputs are present; the code only defines constant strings.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing occurs; the code simply assigns string values to constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is standard configuration definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of constant string assignments representing environment variable names. It includes documentation comments and license information, with no runtime data reading or external calls. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate configuration module for environment variable names in the google-cloud library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign configuration snippet defining environment variable names used for various emulator and service configurations. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
