  "purpose": "Defines environment variable constants used for configuring Google Cloud services and emulators.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed directly via string constants assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only assigns constant strings to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials or hidden code. The comments clarify the purpose of environment variables, and no dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares constants representing environment variable names used in the Google Cloud SDK. There are no inputs, outputs, or processing logic. The code is purely configuration referencing environment variables for emulator hosts and API flags. No indication of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. It functions as documentation and configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module that declares environment variable names used by Google Cloud SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
