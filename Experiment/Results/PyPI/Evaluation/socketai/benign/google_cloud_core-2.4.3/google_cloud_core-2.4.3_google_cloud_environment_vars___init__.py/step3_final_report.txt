  "purpose": "Defines environment variable names used in google-cloud SDK configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables set externally to influence SDK behavior (e.g., host addresses, feature flags).",
  "sinks": "None; the code only declares constants, no data sinks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no runtime data flow, only static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward constant declarations with descriptive comments and license headers.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constants representing environment variable names, with no dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions. It serves as a configuration reference. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The environment variables could influence application behavior if set maliciously externally, but this is a standard configuration pattern, not a vulnerability. The code is well-documented and static, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard configuration snippet defining environment variable names for the google-cloud SDK. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk inherent in this code. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
