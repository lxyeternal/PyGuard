  "purpose": "Define environment variable constants used for configuring Google Cloud emulators and settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables read at runtime: DATASTORE_DATASET, DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST, PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST, BIGTABLE_EMULATOR_HOST, GOOGLE_CLOUD_DISABLE_GRPC.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables could influence the behavior of the cloud service setup, but no direct sink is present in this code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are assigned to constants, which are used elsewhere in the application to configure behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and solely defines constants with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external inputs and only sets string constants for environment variable names. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive information are present. The purpose is to facilitate configuration, not to perform any computation or network activity. No suspicious or malicious logic is identified. It appears to be a standard, safe configuration module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration snippet defining environment variable names for Google Cloud services. There is no malicious behavior, no data leakage, and no security concerns. It simply sets constants with descriptive comments, suitable for configuration purposes.",
