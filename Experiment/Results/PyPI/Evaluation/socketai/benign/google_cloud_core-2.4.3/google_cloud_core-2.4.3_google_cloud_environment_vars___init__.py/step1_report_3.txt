  "purpose": "Defines environment variable constants for configuring Google Cloud emulator settings and behaviors.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via string constants, which are used as configuration flags.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted environment variables read at runtime; these could influence application behavior if set maliciously.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (sources) influence application behavior based on their values (sinks), but this code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code only declares string constants with descriptive comments. No dynamic code execution, secrets, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code declares environment variable names as string constants with descriptive comments. It does not perform any input/output, network operations, or dynamic execution. The environment variables are intended for configuration purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a standard configuration module for a larger Google Cloud SDK or client library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of environment variable names used for configuring Google Cloud emulator behavior. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. It is a benign configuration snippet.",
