  "sources": "Reads version information from 'google/cloud/version.py' via exec(), reads README.rst, and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing code from 'version.py', reading files from disk.",
  "flows": "Source: reading 'version.py' -> sink: exec() execution of its content.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, which could be risky if 'version.py' is compromised, but is a common pattern in packaging scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks with no network activity or dynamic code execution beyond the controlled exec() call. The exec() pattern is standard but could be a vector if the version file is malicious. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The scores reflect minimal risk, primarily due to exec().",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, following common packaging practices. The only minor concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which is standard but should be secured. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
