  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes setup tasks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Points out the use of `exec()` on `version.py`. This is a common pattern but could be risky if the file is compromised.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code detected; the concern is the `exec()` pattern, which is standard but potentially dangerous if the version file is tampered with.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable; the code is standard with a minor concern over `exec()`.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2. These seem appropriate given the context.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the use of `exec()` to load version info.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- The risk score is 0.2, which seems appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern, again noting `exec()` on `version.py`.\n- No malicious code or suspicious behavior.\n- Risk score of 0.3 is slightly higher but still reasonable, given the potential risk of executing external code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.3.\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- Both confirm the standard setup pattern, with no malicious activity.\n- The use of `exec()` is noted but considered standard practice.\n- Risk scores are 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the provided source; no discrepancies.\n- **Malicious code or malware:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation present.\n- **Use of exec():** Common in setup scripts for dynamic versioning, not inherently malicious but a minor security concern if the version file is compromised.\n- **Security risk scores:** Appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the standard pattern and lack of malicious activity, I would set this at **0.1** to acknowledge the minor concern over `exec()`, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the report's conclusions.** The code is standard package setup code with minimal security concern, primarily around the use of `exec()`. No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a very low security risk with no malicious intent detected.",
