  "purpose": "Utility functions for Google Cloud SDK, including data conversions, environment handling, protobuf processing, and gRPC channel/stub creation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input parameters for network setup, protobuf objects, file paths, and external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network channels/stubs creation, data conversion functions, environment variable access, path validation.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables or parameters flows into network setup functions, protobuf conversions, and validation routines.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard helper functions used in Google Cloud SDKs. It handles data conversions, protobuf serialization/deserialization, environment variable reading, and gRPC channel/stub creation. All functions follow best practices, with exception handling where appropriate. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any network activity beyond standard SDK setup, nor does it contain obfuscation or secrets. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are justified. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects the minimal inherent risk in utility functions, but no active vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard helper module for Google Cloud SDK, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain at malware 0, obfuscated 0, and risk approximately 0.1.",
