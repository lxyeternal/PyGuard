{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for managing deprecated modules and issuing warnings about obsolete distributions in Python packages.",
  "sources": "Reads the `sys.version_info` for Python version and calls `metadata.distribution()` to check for installed packages.",
  "sinks": "Calls `warnings.warn()` to issue deprecation warnings based on the presence of an obsolete distribution.",
  "flows": "Checks if a distribution is installed and, if so, issues a deprecation warning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard Python modules for version checking, package metadata, and warnings. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing standard modules and conditionally importing `importlib.metadata` or its backport `importlib_metadata` depending on Python version. It defines a function `complain()` that checks if a specified distribution is installed by calling `metadata.distribution()`. If found, it issues a DeprecationWarning advising to uninstall the package. If the package is not found, it silently passes. All functions and imports are standard for package metadata handling and deprecation warnings. No user input, untrusted data, or network activity is present. There are no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for managing deprecated package distributions, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It relies on standard Python libraries and follows typical patterns for deprecation warnings. The code appears safe and benign.",
