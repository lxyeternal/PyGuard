{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions to warn users about deprecated or obsolete Python packages, specifically checking for package installation and issuing warnings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from system modules (`sys`) and the `importlib.metadata` or its backport `importlib_metadata`. It also reads the `distribution_name` parameter provided to the `complain` function.",
  "sinks": "The code uses `warnings.warn()` to notify users about deprecated packages. No other data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input: `distribution_name` parameter → Checks for package existence via `metadata.distribution()` → Warns via `warnings.warn()` if package exists. No external or untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or malicious code are present. The code solely performs package existence checks and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules and conditionally imports `importlib.metadata` or its backport, which is standard. The `complain()` function checks if a package is installed using `metadata.distribution()`, and issues a deprecation warning if so. If the package isn't found, it silently passes. All operations are typical for deprecation warnings and do not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard helper for deprecation warnings related to package management. It performs no malicious actions, data leakage, or security risks. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
