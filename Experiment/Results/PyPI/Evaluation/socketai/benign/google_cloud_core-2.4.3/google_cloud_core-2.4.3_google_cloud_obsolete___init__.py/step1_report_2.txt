{
  "purpose": "Provide helper functions for deprecated modules, specifically warning users about obsolete package distributions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, importlib_metadata or importlib.metadata, and the argument 'distribution_name' passed to 'complain' function.",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn is a sink that issues a deprecation warning based on the presence of a package; metadata.distribution reads package metadata.",
  "flows": "metadata.distribution reads package info based on 'distribution_name'; if found, a warning is issued via warnings.warn.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard library checks and warnings for deprecated packages. The code conditionally imports based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code loads metadata about installed packages and issues warnings if specific obsolete packages are detected. It uses standard library modules and does not include any malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. The flow from package metadata check to issuing warnings is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate helper module to warn users about deprecated package distributions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
