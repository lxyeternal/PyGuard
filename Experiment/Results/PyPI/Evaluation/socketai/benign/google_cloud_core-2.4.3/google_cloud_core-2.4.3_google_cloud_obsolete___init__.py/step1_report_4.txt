{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for deprecated modules, issuing warnings if certain distributions are installed.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, warnings, and importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata based on Python version. Uses metadata.distribution to check installed packages.",
  "sinks": "metadata.distribution call, which queries installed package metadata. Warnings are issued via warnings.warn, which could potentially be triggered by untrusted input if distribution_name is externally controlled.",
  "flows": "User or external input could influence the `distribution_name` argument. If so, metadata.distribution is called with this value, potentially triggering warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and standard for checking installed packages. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code checks whether a given package (distribution_name) is installed and warns if it is obsolete. It imports necessary modules based on Python version. The function handles exceptions cleanly. No malicious code or suspicious activity is present. The only potential concern is if `distribution_name` is externally controlled, but that is a normal usage scenario for such helper functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard helper module for deprecation warnings related to installed packages. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
