  "purpose": "Utility for issuing deprecation warnings about specific Python packages if they are installed.",
  "sources": "Checks if a package is installed via 'metadata.distribution(distribution_name)'.",
  "sinks": "Warnings issued via 'warnings.warn()' if package is found.",
  "flows": "Input 'distribution_name' is checked against installed packages; if present, triggers a warning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard modules. External control of 'distribution_name' could trigger warnings for arbitrary packages, but this is expected behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple helper that checks for the presence of a specified package and issues a deprecation warning if found. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only potential concern is external control of 'distribution_name', which is typical for such utility functions and not malicious. The logic is correct, and the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and performs a simple check with warning issuance. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
