  "purpose": "Helpers for issuing warnings about deprecated Python packages and modules, primarily to inform users of obsolete packages.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.version_info, importing metadata modules, calling metadata.distribution, and handling exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Warnings issued via warnings.warn(), which could alert users but do not affect security directly.",
  "flows": "Code reads package metadata and issues warnings if the package is found; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activities. The code performs standard deprecation warnings.",
  "analysis": "The script checks Python version to import the appropriate metadata module, then defines a function to warn users if a specified package is obsolete by querying package metadata. It handles the PackageNotFoundError exception gracefully. No external network calls, no execution of untrusted data, and no code obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard, benign code for managing deprecated package warnings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
