  "purpose": "Provides base classes for Google Cloud API clients, managing credentials and HTTP sessions in a secure, standard manner.",
  "sources": "Credential creation from service account info, JSON files, environment variables, and client options.",
  "sinks": "Credentials used for authorized API requests and HTTP session setup.",
  "flows": "Source data (credentials/env vars) flow into credential objects, which are used to authorize HTTP sessions for API communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code follows standard SDK patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured implementation for Google Cloud SDK clients, handling credentials securely and using standard libraries. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The credential management and environment variable usage are appropriate and align with best practices. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, secure, and standard for Google Cloud client setup. All signals indicate no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
