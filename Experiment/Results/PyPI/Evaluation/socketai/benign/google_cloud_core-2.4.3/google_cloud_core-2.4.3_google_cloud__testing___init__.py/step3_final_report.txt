  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for testing, mocking, temporary resource management, and error simulation in Python.",
  "sources": "File creation/removal, module attribute patching, gRPC error generation, temporary directory creation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; primarily internal testing utilities.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; functions perform isolated testing tasks without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard testing patterns without secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of testing utilities such as context managers for monkey patching, temporary file/directory handling, and gRPC error simulation. It uses standard Python libraries and patterns. No suspicious or malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The functions are designed solely for testing purposes, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very low) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing and mocking, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and minimal risk, are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
