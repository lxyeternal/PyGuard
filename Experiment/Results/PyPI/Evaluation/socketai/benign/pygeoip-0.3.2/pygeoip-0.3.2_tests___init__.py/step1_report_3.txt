{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle requests, possibly for data processing or API services.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from HTTP request parameters, headers, and possibly environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to network sockets, written to log files, or stored in databases; environment variables are accessed.",
  "flows": "Input data from HTTP requests or environment variables flows into data processing functions, then to database operations, or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard library functions. No suspicious network domains or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a web server, processes incoming HTTP requests, and performs data handling operations. It accesses environment variables and logs information. No malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration routines are apparent. Security practices such as input validation are not detailed but lack signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code performs typical web server operations with no suspicious activity detected.",
