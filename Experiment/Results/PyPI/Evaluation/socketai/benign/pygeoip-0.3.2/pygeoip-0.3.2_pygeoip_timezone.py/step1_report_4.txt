  "purpose": "Provide a function to return the timezone based on country and region codes using a predefined dictionary.",
  "sources": "Function arguments 'country_code' and 'region_code'; access to 'country_dict' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are used to retrieve timezone info from 'country_dict'; no external or untrusted data flows or modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated parts or suspicious constructs. The data structure contains extensive static data but no hidden or malicious content.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a licensing header, a function that retrieves timezone info from a static dictionary based on provided country and region codes. The dictionary is comprehensive and static, with no dynamic code execution, no network access, and no manipulation of untrusted data. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The function is read-only, and the dictionary is a static resource. The code appears to be a simple lookup utility with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for timezone lookup, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It is a static, well-structured lookup function with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
