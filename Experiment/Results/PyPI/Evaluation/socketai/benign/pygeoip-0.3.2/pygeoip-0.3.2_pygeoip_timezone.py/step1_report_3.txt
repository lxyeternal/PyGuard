{
  "purpose": "Provide a function to retrieve time zones based on country and region codes using a predefined dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'country_code' and 'region_code'; 'country_dict' dictionary storing country and region to timezone mappings.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not write to external systems, files, or network destinations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to fetch data from 'country_dict'. No data flows into or out of untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code only performs dictionary lookups and returns data.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a large static dictionary with country and region timezone mappings. The function retrieves timezone info based on provided codes, with no dynamic code execution or external data access. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. The licensing comments are standard and do not impact security. The code is straightforward and safe, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign lookup utility that retrieves timezone data from a static dictionary. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is simple, with no evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious activity.",
