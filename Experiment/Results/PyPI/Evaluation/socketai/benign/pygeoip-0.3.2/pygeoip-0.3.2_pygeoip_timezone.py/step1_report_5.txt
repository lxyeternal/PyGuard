{
  "purpose": "The function provides a mapping from country and region codes to corresponding time zone strings.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'country_code' and 'region_code'; the 'country_dict' dictionary containing the mappings.",
  "sinks": "The function returns time zone strings based on the input codes; no sinks are present that process untrusted data beyond lookup.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to access data in 'country_dict' and nested dictionaries, returning corresponding time zone values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple lookup function that retrieves time zone information from a predefined static dictionary. The dictionary contains extensive country and region code mappings with no external data inputs or outputs that could lead to data leakage or malicious effects. Usage of 'get' methods ensures safe retrieval without exceptions if keys are missing. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a straightforward data lookup implementation with no external network connections or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign time zone lookup utility with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply maps country and region codes to time zones using static data.",
