{
  "purpose": "Provide a lookup function that returns time zones based on country and region codes.",
  "sources": "The function 'time_zone_by_country_and_region' reads its arguments 'country_code' and 'region_code'. It also accesses the 'country_dict' data structure to retrieve time zone information.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; the code does not perform I/O, network communication, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Input arguments 'country_code' and optional 'region_code' are used to retrieve data from 'country_dict'. The flow is from input through dictionary lookups to the returned time zone string or dictionary value.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The large static data dictionary appears to be a standard mapping of country and region codes to time zones. No dynamic code execution, cryptography, or network communication is present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that maps country and region codes to time zones using a pre-defined dictionary. The dictionary 'country_dict' contains country codes as keys with either string values or nested dictionaries for regions. The function safely retrieves data without executing external or untrusted code, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be a static data lookup utility with no indications of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, static data lookup utility for time zone information based on country and region codes. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities in this code. It is a straightforward, read-only data structure accessed in a controlled manner.",
