  "purpose": "Static lookup utility for mapping country and region codes to timezone strings.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'country_code' and 'region_code' used for dictionary 'get' operations on 'country_dict'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is retrieved from static in-memory dictionary without external data flow.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into dictionary 'get' calls, returning timezone strings based on country and region codes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, read-only dictionary mapping country and region codes to timezone strings. The function performs simple dictionary lookups with no external dependencies, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The data dictionary is extensive but static, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious content. The logic is clear and safe, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence scores of 1 reflect certainty in this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static timezone lookup utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' evaluations and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
