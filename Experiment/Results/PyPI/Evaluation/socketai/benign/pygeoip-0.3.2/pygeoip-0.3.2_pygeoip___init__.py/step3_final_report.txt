{
  "purpose": "A Python library for GeoIP lookups, performing geolocation and network information queries using local database files and hostname resolution.",
  "sources": "File reads from local database files, socket DNS resolution functions, IP address inputs, environment variables (indirectly via socket functions).",
  "sinks": "Data returned to caller, hostname resolution results, database record data, network functions (DNS lookups).",
  "flows": "Input IP addresses or hostnames are resolved via DNS or converted to integers, then data is retrieved from local files or memory, with data flows from sources (file reads, DNS) to sinks (return values, data structures).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity, standard use of threading locks and file/memory mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard GeoIP lookup library with functions for reading local database files, hostname resolution, and IP-based data retrieval. It employs thread safety, handles different database formats, and performs typical geolocation tasks. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. DNS functions are used legitimately for hostname resolution. The data flows are straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate geolocation and network info queries, and no signs of sabotage or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured GeoIP lookup library with no malicious intent or behavior. It performs standard operations such as file access, hostname resolution, and data retrieval without obfuscation or malicious network activity. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The code's design and behavior are consistent with safe, open-source geolocation utilities.",
