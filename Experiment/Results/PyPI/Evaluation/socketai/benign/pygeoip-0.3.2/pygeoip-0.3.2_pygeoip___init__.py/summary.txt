  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured GeoIP lookup library with no malicious intent or behavior. It performs standard operations such as file access, hostname resolution, and data retrieval without obfuscation or malicious network activity. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The code's design and behavior are consistent with safe, open-source geolocation utilities."
