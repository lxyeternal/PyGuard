  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines static constants and mappings for geolocation, with no active data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign static configuration module, part of a geolocation library, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static data definitions, license headers, and version checks.\n- No dynamic code, no external data handling, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on static data for geographic and network info, with no untrusted input or external communication.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar findings: static data, environment detection, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- No security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: static data, environment check, no malicious activity.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?** No. All reports agree the code is purely static data and environment detection.\n- **Obfuscation?** None observed; all data structures are straightforward.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** No, since there's no input processing, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware score?** Zero across all reports, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk?** Also zero, as the code is purely configuration data.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the comprehensive static nature, lack of dynamic behavior, and absence of suspicious patterns, I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign static configuration module for geolocation purposes. No evidence suggests malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.",
