{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define constants, data structures, and mappings for geolocation and regional information, likely used in a geolocation or IP lookup library.",
  "sources": "Constants, license information, imported functions (platform.python_version_tuple). No external or untrusted input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs present. No network connections, file operations, or environment variable usage are visible.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows; the code is primarily static data definitions and version checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code strictly contains data definitions and license headers. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly includes licensing comments, imports, and static data structures such as dictionaries and tuples for regional, country, continent, and network speed information. It performs a simple Python version check and defines constants related to geographic database structure and editions. No input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present. The code appears to be part of a larger geolocation library, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of data definitions for a geolocation library, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. It solely provides static data and version checks.",
