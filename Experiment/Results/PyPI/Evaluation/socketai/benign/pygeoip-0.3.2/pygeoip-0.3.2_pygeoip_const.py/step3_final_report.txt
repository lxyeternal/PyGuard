  "purpose": "Static data definitions and mappings for geolocation and IP-related information, including environment detection.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input; static data structures and constants defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely static data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data used for lookup purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; straightforward static data definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static constants, mappings, and environment detection logic, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. It serves as a configuration/data module for geolocation/IP purposes. All signals indicate benign intent, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0, consistent with the content.",
