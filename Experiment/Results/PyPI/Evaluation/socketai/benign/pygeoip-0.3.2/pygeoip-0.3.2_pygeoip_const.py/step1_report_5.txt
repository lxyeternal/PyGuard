{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define geographic and network data mappings, constants, and configurations for a geolocation or IP-based lookup library. It primarily provides static data structures and version compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from platform module (python_version_tuple) for environment detection.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only initializes static data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely static, containing no dynamic execution, obfuscated language features, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of static data definitions, such as mappings for geographic locations (DMA_MAP), country codes, country names, continent names, and network speeds. It includes environment detection via platform module but no user input handling, network activity, or file I/O. No malicious patterns, code injection, or privacy violations are identified. The code does not perform any actions or data processing that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a static data module for geolocation and network information, with no malicious or suspicious behavior present. It is purely informational and configuration-based, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
