  "purpose": "Define constants, data structures, and mappings related to geographic and network information, likely for a geolocation or IP database library.",
  "sources": "Import of platform.python_version_tuple() function to check Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data sinks are present; code mainly defines static mappings and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only establishes static data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The large static dictionaries and constants are typical for data modules.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static data definitions: dictionaries mapping numeric codes to geographic locations, country codes, continent codes, network speed names, and constants for database structures. The import of 'platform.python_version_tuple' is used solely for environment detection, which is standard. There are no functions executing untrusted input, no network calls, no file I/O, or code execution commands. No obfuscation, no suspicious dynamic code, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. All data appears to be for geographic/IP data referencing. The code appears benign and designed for data lookup or geolocation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data module defining constants and static mappings for geolocation/IP databases. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It does not perform any data processing, I/O, or external communications. Overall security risk is minimal.",
