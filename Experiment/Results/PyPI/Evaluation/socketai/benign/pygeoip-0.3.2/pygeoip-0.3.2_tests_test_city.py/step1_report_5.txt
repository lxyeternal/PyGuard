  "purpose": "Unit testing for pygeoip library functionalities, including IP geolocation lookups and cache methods.",
  "sources": "Reads IP address strings ('66.92.181.240', '64.233.161.99', '212.58.253.68') for geolocation queries, and configuration path 'CITY_DB_PATH' from 'tests.config'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written to external systems, nor are there network communications or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "IP address inputs are used as sources; results are used for assertions within the test; no external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code strictly performs standard unit testing operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports unittest and pygeoip, setting up test cases for geolocation lookups using the pygeoip library. It tests functions like 'country_code_by_addr', 'country_name_by_addr', and 'record_by_addr' with specific IP addresses, verifying expected results. It also initializes GeoIP objects with different cache settings. The code performs typical unit tests without any dynamic code execution, network communication, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. All operations are standard for testing a geolocation library. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test suite for the pygeoip library with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It solely verifies geolocation functionalities without any security risks or malware indicators.",
