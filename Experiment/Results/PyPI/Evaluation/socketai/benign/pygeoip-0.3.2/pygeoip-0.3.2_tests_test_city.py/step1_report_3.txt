  "purpose": "Unit tests for the pygeoip library to validate geographic IP lookup functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads IP addresses as input in test cases for geographic lookup functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input IP addresses flow into pygeoip functions to retrieve location data; no untrusted data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. Usage of static IPs is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for the pygeoip library, validating country codes, country names, region data, and record retrieval. No data manipulation from untrusted sources, no network communication, or file handling outside standard library imports. The usage of static IPs and paths is typical for testing purposes. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Dependencies are standard testing libraries and pygeoip, which is used correctly.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign unit test suite for a geolocation library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
