  "purpose": "Unit tests for the pygeoip library verifying geographic data retrieval based on IP addresses.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded IP addresses within test cases, local database file specified by CITY_DB_PATH.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; tests only read data from local database and perform assertions.",
  "flows": "Input IP addresses → pygeoip library functions → retrieval of geographic info → assertions; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with static test data and no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite that uses fixed IPs and expected geographic data to verify pygeoip functionality. It does not process untrusted input, perform network communication, or modify system state. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present. The use of local database files and static data is typical for testing. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to zero, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of unit tests for a geolocation library with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are accurate and consistent with its behavior.",
