  "purpose": "Unit testing the GeoIP organization lookup functionality using the pygeoip library.",
  "sources": "Reads the ORG_DB_PATH configuration for database location; calls org_by_addr method with a fixed IP address.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data leakage or external effect present.",
  "flows": "Reads database path -> loads GeoIP database -> performs IP-to-organization lookup -> asserts expected value.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage appears standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports unittest and pygeoip, loads a database path, and runs a test to verify that a specific IP address maps to an expected organization name. The code is a straightforward test case with no dynamic code execution, no network connections, no data leaks, or malicious patterns. It appears to be a normal testing script for verifying functionality of the pygeoip library. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard unit test script verifying GeoIP lookup functionality. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
