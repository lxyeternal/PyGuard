  "purpose": "A unit test verifying the organization name for a specific IP address using the pygeoip library.",
  "sources": "Reads a fixed IP address ('70.46.123.145') and a database path from configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Loads database from config -> performs org_by_addr lookup -> asserts expected value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static IP and database path; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that loads a local GeoIP database and verifies a static IP mapping. It contains no dynamic input, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The code uses standard libraries and practices, with no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The test is deterministic and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward verification of IP-to-organization mapping. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0.",
