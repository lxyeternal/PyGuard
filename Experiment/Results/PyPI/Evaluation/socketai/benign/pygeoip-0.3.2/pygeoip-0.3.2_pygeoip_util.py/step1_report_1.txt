  "purpose": "Utility functions for IP address conversion and data stream handling, likely used for geolocation or network analysis.",
  "sources": "socket.inet_aton, socket.inet_pton, input IP address strings, data parameter in str2fp",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions that process IP addresses, StringIO/BytesIO objects for data handling",
  "flows": "IP address string input -> ip2long function -> socket functions -> hexlify -> integer output; data input -> str2fp -> StringIO or BytesIO object",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. Use of standard socket/IP functions is typical for network code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two utility functions: ip2long converts IP addresses to numeric form, handling both IPv4 and IPv6, with appropriate exception handling; str2fp converts byte data into file-like objects depending on Python version. All components are standard for network-related data processing. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The licensing information indicates open-source usage with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward utility functions for IP address conversion and data handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
