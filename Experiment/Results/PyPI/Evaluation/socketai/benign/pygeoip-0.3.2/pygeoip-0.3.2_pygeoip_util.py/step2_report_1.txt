  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; utility functions for IP conversion and data handling.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9. The high risk score seems unwarranted given the benign description. The functions are standard and do not introduce security risks.  \n- **Justification:** The code does not perform any malicious activity, exfiltration, or obfuscation. The high risk score overstates the actual security concern.  \n- **Recommendation:** Reduce risk score to 0 or 0.1.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; the code matches the description.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1. Again, an overly high risk score.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The functions are straightforward utility code.  \n- **Recommendation:** Lower risk score to 0 or 0.1.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same code, similar description.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. This seems more reasonable given the benign description.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just utility functions.  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is or consider 0.1 for minimal risk.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same code, similar description.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or suspicious activity.  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same code, similar description.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** The functions are standard utilities with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly indicate 0. The code is benign utility functions.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** The first two reports have excessively high risk scores (0.9 and 1). Given the benign nature, these should be lowered to 0 or at most 0.1.  \n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent across reports).  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (consistent).  \n- **Risk score:** Should be adjusted downward, ideally to 0.1 or 0, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe code is a straightforward, open-source utility module for IP conversion and data handling, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The high risk scores in some reports are unjustified and should be revised accordingly.",
