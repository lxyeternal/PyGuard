  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for IP address conversion and data handling, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The high risk scores assigned in some reports are overestimations and should be revised downward to reflect the benign nature. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in security-sensitive environments."
