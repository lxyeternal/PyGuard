{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pygeoip' package, used to distribute a GeoIP API in Python.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata like version (__version__), package list, author info, and repository URL.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; mainly metadata definitions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing version info and then calling setup() with package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and no obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup file that uses setuptools or distutils to prepare package installation. It imports version info from 'pygeoip' and defines package metadata such as name, description, author, URL, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. It appears to be a straightforward distribution script for open-source software.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, no malicious code, or security issues. It is a benign, standard package configuration file.",
