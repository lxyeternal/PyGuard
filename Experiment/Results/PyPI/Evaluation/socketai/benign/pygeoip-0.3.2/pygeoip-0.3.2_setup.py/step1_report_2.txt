  "sources": "Reads version information from __version__ in pygeoip module, and reads package metadata from hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is written or transmitted in this script.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from module, then uses static data to configure package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup script, importing version info and calling setup() with static metadata. It uses conditional import for setup, which is common for compatibility. No user input, network activity, or dynamic execution present. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
