  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pygeoip' Python package, providing package metadata and configuration for installation.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools or distutils, import of __version__ from pygeoip module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "The version variable is imported from the pygeoip module; package metadata is defined statically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, using conditional import for setup tools. It retrieves version info from the package itself and defines metadata. No data from external sources, no execution of untrusted code, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code strictly follows conventional package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious anomalies detected.",
