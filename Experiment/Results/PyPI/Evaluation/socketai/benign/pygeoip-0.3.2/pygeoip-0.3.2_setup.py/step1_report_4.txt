  "purpose": "Setup script for the pygeoip Python package, used to distribute and install the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools or distutils, and import of __version__ from pygeoip.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata and setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no obfuscated code, hidden behavior, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import setup from setuptools, falling back to distutils if necessary. It then imports the package's version and proceeds to call setup() with package metadata, including author info, URL, classifiers, and license. All code is straightforward, intended for packaging distribution. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a standard Python setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified.",
