{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the 'pygeoip' Python package, used to configure package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static import of '__version__' from the 'pygeoip' module.",
  "sinks": "The script calls 'setup()' with static data; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import of version info from 'pygeoip' to the setup configuration; no dynamic data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; the script is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py file that conditionally imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' or 'distutils', then calls 'setup()' with static package metadata, including version info imported from the package itself. There are no dynamic executions, network calls, user inputs, or obfuscated constructs. The code's purpose is solely to facilitate package installation and distribution. All signals indicate benign, standard behavior with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
