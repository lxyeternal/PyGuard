  "purpose": "Setup script for the pygeoip Python package, intended to facilitate its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and pygeoip __version__, and metadata provided to the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution or data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "Reading __version__ from pygeoip module and passing static metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard package setup operations without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from setuptools or distutils, then calls setup() with package metadata. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to be a conventional setup script for a Python package, using static information and standard library functions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flow are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply prepares the package for distribution using conventional methods.",
