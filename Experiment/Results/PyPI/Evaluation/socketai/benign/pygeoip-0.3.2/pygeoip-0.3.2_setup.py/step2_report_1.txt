  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the provided code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code in question is a standard Python setup script, primarily importing version info and calling `setup()` with static metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no user input, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic are present.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and typical for package distribution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports correctly identify it as a benign setup script.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning mistakes:\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. All reports correctly interpret the code as a standard, non-malicious setup script.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.5. Given the benign nature, 0 is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- Since there is no malicious behavior, no reason to assign higher risk scores.\n- The reports' scores seem appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Potential claims based on assumptions:\n\n- No such claims are present; all reports accurately describe the code as benign.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### My own estimates:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis setup script is a standard, safe, open-source package configuration file with no security concerns.",
