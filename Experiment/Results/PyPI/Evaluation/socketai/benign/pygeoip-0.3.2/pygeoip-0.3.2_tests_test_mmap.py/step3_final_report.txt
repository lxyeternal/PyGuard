  "purpose": "Unit test for pygeoip.GeoIP class initialization with cache settings and internal type verification.",
  "sources": "Local database path (COUNTRY_DB_PATH), internal attribute gi._type",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no external network or data output",
  "flows": "Initialization of GeoIP object from local path -> internal attribute check",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded internal attribute access (_type), standard test pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test importing standard libraries, initializing a GeoIP object with specific cache flags, and asserting its internal '_type' attribute. It interacts only with local files and the library, with no network activity, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns. The use of internal attributes (_type) is typical in testing internal states, not malicious. No obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. The confidence is high (1), as the code is simple and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test for the pygeoip library, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain as assigned.",
