{
  "purpose": "Define a plugin class for AST analysis, likely for code linting or static analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'tree' parameter in the __init__ method, which is an AST object.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network, file, or sensitive data exposure observed.",
  "flows": "The AST tree is processed by the Visitor object, which collects errors; errors are then yielded with line, column, message, and type.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a straightforward plugin pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a plugin class that accepts an AST tree, uses a Visitor class to analyze the AST, and yields errors found during visitation. The code is structurally sound and typical for static analysis plugins. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute untrusted code. It mainly delegates AST traversal and error collection to the Visitor class, which is imported but not shown here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign static analysis plugin component with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for a code quality or linting tool.",
