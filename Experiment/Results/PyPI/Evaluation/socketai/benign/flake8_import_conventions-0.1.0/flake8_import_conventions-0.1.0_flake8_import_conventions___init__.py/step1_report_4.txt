{
  "purpose": "Define an AST-based plugin class for static code analysis, likely for a linter tool.",
  "sources": "Input: AST of Python code (self._tree).",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous if visitor.errors contains untrusted data that could be executed or mishandled, but here it is only yielded as tuples.",
  "flows": "Input AST -> Visitor.visit() -> visitor.errors -> yield errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a plugin class that uses a Visitor pattern to analyze an AST. The class stores the AST and calls the visitor's visit method, then yields errors. There are no apparent code injection points, no network or file operations, or data exfiltration. The code is well-structured, standard, and relies on external visitor logic. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The plugin appears to be for static analysis only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a static analysis plugin that leverages an AST visitor to find issues in Python code. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
