  "purpose": "Static analysis plugin for Python AST, utilizing a Visitor pattern to identify errors.",
  "sources": "AST nodes processed during visitor.visit(self._tree).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "AST traversal from the root node to error collection via visitor.visit.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Plugin class that initializes with an AST and uses a Visitor to analyze it, yielding errors. No malicious code, external data handling, or network activity is present. The Visitor class is imported but not shown; its usage appears standard. The code is benign, with no obfuscation or security issues. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, risk score of 0, and high confidence. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard patterns support a conclusion of no malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis plugin component with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe and standard implementation.",
