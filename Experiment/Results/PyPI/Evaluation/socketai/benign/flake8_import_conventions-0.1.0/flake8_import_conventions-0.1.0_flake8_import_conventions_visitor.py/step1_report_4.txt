{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze Python AST nodes to check for specific import patterns, possibly for linting or security validation.",
  "sources": "Reads AST nodes for import statements (`ast.Import`) and their attributes such as `names`, `lineno`, and `col_offset`.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points are `name2asname` and `name2message` lookups which are used to generate messages, but no direct sink for untrusted data flow is apparent.",
  "flows": "Source: AST import nodes -> check_import_name function using `node.names` and external mappings -> appends error messages based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, obfuscated constructs, or hardcoded secrets are evident. The logic is straightforward for a static analysis tool.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis on Python import AST nodes, validating import aliases against predefined mappings. It does not process untrusted input dynamically or execute code. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. Usage of external attributes and the AST library is typical for static analysis. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign static analysis utility for checking import aliasing consistency. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior based on the provided code fragment.",
