  "purpose": "Static analysis utility to verify import alias correctness against predefined mappings.",
  "sources": "ast.Import nodes, specifically node.names and node.lineno, node.col_offset",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "Import node -> check_import_name function -> errors list if mismatches occur",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static analysis logic, no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code performs static validation of import statements, checking for alias mismatches using external mappings. It does not execute or handle untrusted data, network, or file operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The logic is simple and standard for static analysis tools. External mappings could be manipulated if compromised, but this is outside the code's scope and not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation to 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
