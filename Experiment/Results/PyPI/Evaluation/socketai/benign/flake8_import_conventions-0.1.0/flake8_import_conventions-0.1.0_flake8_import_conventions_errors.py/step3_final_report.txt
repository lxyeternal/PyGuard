{
  "purpose": "Generate descriptive messages for package import conventions, including codes and import statements, based on static predefined data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded dictionaries 'name2asname' and 'name2message'; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Static data used to generate formatted strings; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to produce formatted import codes and descriptions based on static dictionaries. It performs simple string formatting without dynamic code execution, external input, or network activity. The dictionaries are hardcoded, and the functions are deterministic. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report appears overly cautious but does not reflect actual security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended for documentation or style enforcement. No malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The minimal security risk score can be adjusted to zero for accuracy, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
