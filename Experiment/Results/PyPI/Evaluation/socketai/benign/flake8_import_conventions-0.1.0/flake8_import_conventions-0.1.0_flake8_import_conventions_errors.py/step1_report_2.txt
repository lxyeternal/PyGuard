{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions to generate formatted import code descriptions and constructs dictionaries mapping package names to import conventions and messages.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the hardcoded dictionaries 'name2asname' and the parameters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to untrusted sources or sinks; output is generated from predefined data and internal functions.",
  "flows": "The data flows from predefined dictionaries through functions to generate descriptive messages, with no external data input or output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. Functions are straightforward, with no obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs dictionaries mapping package names to alias names, then generates messages combining codes and import descriptions. No external inputs, no network activity, no file operations, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears purely to generate descriptive strings for documentation or code style enforcement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and intended for documentation or code convention purposes. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It simply constructs descriptive messages based on static data.",
