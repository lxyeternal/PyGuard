{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate formatted import statements and descriptions for various Python packages, potentially for documentation or code style enforcement.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'name2asname' dictionary and function parameters such as 'number', 'package_name', and 'alias'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs strings generated by functions, but no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data (package names, aliases, numbers) flows through functions to produce formatted strings; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code is straightforward and focuses on string formatting and dictionary comprehension.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate formatted codes and descriptive import statements based on provided inputs. It constructs dictionaries mapping package names to import aliases and messages, using the functions to generate descriptive strings. All data handling involves static inputs or function parameters without external or untrusted sources. The code contains no system calls, network activity, or obfuscated segments. It appears to be a utility for documentation or code style enforcement, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely generates formatted strings for documentation or style checking purposes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal.",
