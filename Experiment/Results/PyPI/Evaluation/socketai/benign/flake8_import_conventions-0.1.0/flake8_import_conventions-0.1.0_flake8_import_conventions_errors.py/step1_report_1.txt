{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate descriptive messages for package import conventions, likely for documentation or coding standards enforcement.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the dictionary keys and values: 'name2asname' and 'name2message' dictionaries, which are hardcoded within the code.",
  "sinks": "The generated messages are stored in 'name2message'. No direct data leaks or external outputs are evident; the code does not write to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining the dictionaries to generating messages by calling 'generate_message' with package names and aliases, storing results in 'name2message'. No untrusted data sources or dangerous flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to generate formatted import descriptions for packages, including their aliases. It then creates two dictionaries: one mapping package names to aliases, and another mapping those names to generated messages. The code is static, with no input/output beyond internal data structures, and no network or file operations. All code appears to serve a benign purpose related to coding conventions or documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely for generating descriptive messages about package import conventions. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected.",
