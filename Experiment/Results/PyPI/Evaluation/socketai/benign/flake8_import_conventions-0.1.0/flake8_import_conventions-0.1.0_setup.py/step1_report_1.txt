{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'flake8-import-conventions' Python package, including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading package data, dependencies, and setup parameters; no external or untrusted data input.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily involves package setup and metadata; no sinks for untrusted data, system commands, or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to security issues; all operations are static setup configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is a straightforward setup script with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for a plugin. No code injection, malicious logic, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All data is static, and there are no external data reads, network calls, or system modifications. The script appears to be a benign configuration file for packaging and distributing a Python plugin.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is very low.",
