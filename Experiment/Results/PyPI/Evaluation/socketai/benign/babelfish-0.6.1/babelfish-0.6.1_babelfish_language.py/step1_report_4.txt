{
  "purpose": "The code defines a language handling module that loads ISO 639-3 language data, manages language conversions, and provides a Language class for representing human languages with optional country and script details.",
  "sources": "Reads ISO-639-3 language data from 'iso-639-3.tab' resource stream; accesses language converters via attribute access and class methods; reads data from class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted input sources or data leaks; attribute access to converters does not process untrusted data; no external network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Resource stream reading populates iso language data; Language class methods create instances based on known codes; attribute access to converters triggers conversions; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of resource_stream to load data is standard; dynamic attribute access to converters is flexible but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns observed; code appears structured and consistent with its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code loads language data from a resource file, manages language conversions with a converter manager, and defines a Language class with methods for creating instances from codes and IETF strings. It employs standard Python patterns such as class methods, attribute overloading, and namedtuples. No evidence of malicious logic, code injection, or suspicious behavior. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or backdoors. All data handling appears to be read-only and controlled. The code adheres to common open-source package practices, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured language management module for an open-source package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It operates within expected parameters for its functionality, with no signs of supply chain attacks or sabotage.",
