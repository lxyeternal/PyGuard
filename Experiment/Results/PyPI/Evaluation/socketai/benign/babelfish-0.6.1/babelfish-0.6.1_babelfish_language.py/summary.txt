  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured language data management module with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified by the dynamic converter calls but does not indicate actual threat. Overall, supply chain security is minimal, and the code is safe."
