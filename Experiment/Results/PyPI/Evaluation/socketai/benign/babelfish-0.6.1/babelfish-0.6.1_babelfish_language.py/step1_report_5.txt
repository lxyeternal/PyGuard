  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for handling language codes, conversions, and metadata, including loading ISO language data from an external resource.",
  "sources": "Resource stream 'babelfish' data/iso-639-3.tab, input parameters for class constructors and methods, external converters, environment variables for resource loading.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to converters (potentially executing code), raising exceptions, attribute access (__getattr__), and string operations involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Loading ISO data from resource stream -> creating Language instances from codes or IETF strings -> accessing dynamic attributes which invoke converters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data manipulation. Use of resource_stream to load external data is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features beyond normal Python dynamic attribute handling.",
  "analysis": "The code loads ISO language data from a resource file, which is standard for language metadata. The Language class supports dynamic attribute access that calls external converters, which could be a point for malicious activity if the converters are compromised, but in this code, they are imported from a controlled module. The code validates language codes against the loaded dataset. No suspicious data leakage, no system command executions, no network activity, and no backdoors are present. The use of __getattr__ to delegate to converters is typical for extensible design, not malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malware behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for handling language codes and conversions, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The only potential concern is reliance on external converters, but this is within expected behavior for an extensible library. Overall, the code is safe and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior.",
