{
  "purpose": "Manage language data, load ISO-639-3 language codes from resource files, and provide language conversion and representation functionalities.",
  "sources": "Resource stream loading 'iso-639-3.tab' file, dynamic attribute access via __getattr__ for converters, data initialization from resource files.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute access invokes external converter modules; no direct data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Resource stream data -> ISO language structures -> Language class attributes -> __getattr__ calls converters based on attribute names.",
  "anomalies": "Use of resource_stream for data loading is standard; dynamic __getattr__ could be exploited if external converters are malicious, but this is an intended extensibility pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code loads language data from trusted resource files, defines a Language class with flexible conversion methods, and uses dynamic attribute access to delegate to external converter modules. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The reliance on external converters introduces a potential attack surface if those modules are compromised, but this is a common pattern in plugin-based systems. The data loading and class design are standard, and no backdoors or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured language data management module with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified by the dynamic converter calls but does not indicate actual threat. Overall, supply chain security is minimal, and the code is safe.",
