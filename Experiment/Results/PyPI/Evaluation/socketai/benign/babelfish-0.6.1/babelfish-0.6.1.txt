      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured language data management module with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified by the dynamic converter calls but does not indicate actual threat. Overall, supply chain security is minimal, and the code is safe."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data loader and validator for ISO-15924 scripts. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; the malware and obfuscated scores should be 0.0, and the security risk score should also be 0.0, reflecting the benign nature."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin architecture with no embedded malicious code. The main security concern is the potential execution of malicious plugins during dynamic loading. The bug in `copy()` is minor and does not affect security. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code is safe if plugins are trusted; otherwise, plugin validation is advised."
