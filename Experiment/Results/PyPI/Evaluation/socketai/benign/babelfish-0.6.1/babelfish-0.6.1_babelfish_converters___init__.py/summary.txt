  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin architecture with no embedded malicious code. The main security concern is the potential execution of malicious plugins during dynamic loading. The bug in `copy()` is minor and does not affect security. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code is safe if plugins are trusted; otherwise, plugin validation is advised."
