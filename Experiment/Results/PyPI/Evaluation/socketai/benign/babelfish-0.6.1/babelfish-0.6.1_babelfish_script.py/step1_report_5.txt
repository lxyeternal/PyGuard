  "purpose": "To load and manage ISO-15924 script codes and their associated data, providing a Script class for representing and validating scripts.",
  "sources": "resource_stream('babelfish', 'data/iso15924-utf8-20131012.txt') - reads script data from a resource file",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or dangerous data flow present",
  "flows": "Data read from the resource file is decoded and processed into Script objects, stored in data structures; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present",
  "analysis": "The code reads a resource file containing script data, parses each line into IsoScript namedtuples, and populates data structures. The Script class validates script codes against the loaded data and provides properties and methods for comparison and representation. The code follows standard practices, and the resource file handling appears secure and benign. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data loading and validation module for ISO-15924 scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely loads data, provides validation, and supports typical object behaviors.",
