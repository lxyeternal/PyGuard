  "purpose": "Load ISO-15924 script data from a resource file and provide a Script class to represent and validate script codes.",
  "sources": "resource_stream('babelfish', 'data/iso15924-utf8-20131012.txt') reading from a data file; the file is read line by line and decoded.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code. The code processes data from a resource file into memory without passing untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "File data is read from the resource stream, decoded, processed into namedtuples, and stored in in-memory dictionaries and lists; no external data flow or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code appears straightforward in data loading and class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code loads script data from a resource file, decodes and processes it into structured namedtuples, and populates dictionaries for lookup. The Script class provides validation and representation methods based on this data. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident. The resource stream usage is standard for data loading, and there is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data loader and class definition for script codes. No malicious intent or security risks are present. It appears safe and well-structured, focusing solely on data processing without external interactions.",
