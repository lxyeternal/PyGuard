{
  "purpose": "To load ISO-15924 script data from a resource file and provide a Script class to handle script codes and names.",
  "sources": "resource_stream('babelfish', 'data/iso15924-utf8-20131012.txt') reads data from an external resource file.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to external systems, outputs, or network channels.",
  "flows": "Data read from the resource file is decoded, parsed, and stored in memory; the Script class accesses the SCRIPTS dictionary for validation and retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic resource loading without validation; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present; the resource file decoding appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and local compatibility modules, loads a data file containing ISO-15924 script information, and populates data structures. The Script class validates script codes against the loaded data. There are no evident suspicious behaviors, such as network activity, code injection, or malicious backdoors. The resource file is used only for data initialization. The code appears well-structured, with no obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign data loading and validation module for ISO-15924 scripts. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It securely reads and parses data from a resource file and provides a script validation class. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
