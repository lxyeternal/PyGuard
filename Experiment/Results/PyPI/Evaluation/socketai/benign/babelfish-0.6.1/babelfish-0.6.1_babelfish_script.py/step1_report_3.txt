  "purpose": "Load ISO-15924 script data from a resource file and define a Script class to represent writing systems by their code.",
  "sources": "Resource file 'iso15924-utf8-20131012.txt' loaded via resource_stream; data read line-by-line from the file.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes untrusted data or interacts with external systems in a way that could lead to data leaks or command execution.",
  "flows": "Data read from the resource file is decoded and processed into namedtuples; no untrusted input flows into security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The resource file is read and parsed in a straightforward manner. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a data file from a package resource, skipping comments and blank lines, and populates data structures with script information. The Script class provides validation against known scripts, and typical dunder methods facilitate object representation and comparison. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior. No external network calls or data manipulations suggest malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard data-loading and class definition module for managing script information, with no evidence of malicious or harmful behavior. It safely loads data from a resource file and provides an interface for script objects.",
