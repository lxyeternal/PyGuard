  "purpose": "Load ISO-15924 script data from a resource file, parse it into structured namedtuples, and provide a validation class for script codes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'iso15924-utf8-20131012.txt' via resource_stream, decoding each line and skipping comments/blank lines.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; validation occurs internally against loaded data.",
  "flows": "Resource stream reads data -> lines decoded and parsed -> stored in SCRIPT_MATRIX and SCRIPTS -> Script class validates codes against SCRIPTS.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data loading from a static resource, populates data structures, and defines a class for validation and representation. It contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The resource file is assumed to be safe and integral to the package. The validation logic is straightforward, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent. No external communication or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data loader and validator for ISO-15924 scripts. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate; the malware and obfuscated scores should be 0.0, and the security risk score should also be 0.0, reflecting the benign nature.",
