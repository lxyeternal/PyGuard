  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code loads data from a resource file within the package (`resource_stream`), decodes it, and populates data structures. \n- It defines a `Script` class that validates script codes against the loaded data.\n- There are no external network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns.\n- The data file appears to be a static resource bundled with the package.\n- The code is straightforward, with no evident malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No issues found; the code is safe, standard data loader, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities. \n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with slightly lower confidence (0.95). Mentions no suspicious behavior, but notes the resource loading is straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Also reasonable. The slight security risk score (0.1) seems to reflect a conservative stance on resource loading, but given the code's simplicity, it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general conclusion—benign data loading and validation, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard data parsing and validation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard data loading and validation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; 0.0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; 0.0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** The highest is 0.1, which is very conservative given the code's benign nature. A more appropriate risk score would be **0.0**, since the code does not perform any risky operations or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- The code is a straightforward data loader with validation logic based on static resources.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The resource loading is standard and does not involve dynamic execution or external data sources that could introduce risks.\n- The risk scores should be **0.0** across all reports, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Adjusted Scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0          |\n| 2       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0          |\n| 3       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0          |\n| 4       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0          |\n| 5       | 0.0     | 0.0          | 0.0          |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this, with all security-related scores set to zero.",
