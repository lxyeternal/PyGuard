  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward data loader: reading a resource file, decoding lines, parsing into namedtuples, populating dictionaries, and defining a class for validation and representation.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior, such as code injection, obfuscation, external network activity, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The resource stream is used solely for data initialization, with no external communication or data flow that could be exploited.\n- The code structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The data file `'iso15924-utf8-20131012.txt'` is loaded from a package resource; assuming the resource file is safe and unaltered, the data loading process is secure.\n- The validation logic in the `Script` class is straightforward, checking script codes against loaded data.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident in the code.\n- The code does not handle potential file reading errors explicitly (e.g., file not found, decoding errors), but this does not constitute a security issue—more a robustness concern.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low scores (~0.1 or 0), which seems reasonable given the data loading and validation nature.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No higher risk or malware scores are justified, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The only potential concern could be the reliance on external resource files, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is benign, straightforward, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0 — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to reliance on external resource files, but this is standard and not risky in itself.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard data loader and validation class for ISO-15924 scripts. It is safe, well-structured, and free from malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code, with negligible security concern.",
