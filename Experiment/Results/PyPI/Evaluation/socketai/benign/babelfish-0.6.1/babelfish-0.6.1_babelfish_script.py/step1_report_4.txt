  "purpose": "Load and parse ISO-15924 script data, and provide a Script class for handling script codes.",
  "sources": "Resource stream 'babelfish/data/iso15924-utf8-20131012.txt' which reads the script data file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input handling or output sinks that could lead to data leakage or code execution.",
  "flows": "The data read from the resource stream is decoded, processed, and stored in global variables. The Script class accesses this data via lookup, with validation against known scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns. The code properly reads data, validates script codes, and defines a straightforward class. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a data file, decodes each line, and populates data structures with script information. The Script class provides validation against known script codes and basic utility methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. Usage appears standard for data parsing and validation. The file handling and class implementation follow normal patterns without suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard data parsing and provides a script handling class with validation. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It appears safe and benign.",
