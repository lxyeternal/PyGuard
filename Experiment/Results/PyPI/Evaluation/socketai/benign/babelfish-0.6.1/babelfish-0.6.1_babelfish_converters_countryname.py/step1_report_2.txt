{
  "purpose": "The code provides a converter class for country names and alpha-2 codes, enabling bidirectional conversion between them.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the COUNTRY_MATRIX data structure during initialization and from function parameters in convert() and reverse() methods.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions with untrusted input if conversions fail, but does not execute or handle data in a way that affects external systems or leaks data.",
  "flows": "Input data (alpha2 or country name) is validated against internal mappings, with exceptions raised on invalid inputs. No external data flow or system calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a data converter.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes mappings between country codes and names using data from COUNTRY_MATRIX. Conversion methods perform lookups and raise exceptions if inputs are invalid. No external data transmission, no code injection, no insecure operations. The code appears to be a utility for data normalization without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data conversion utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
