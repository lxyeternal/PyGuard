{
  "purpose": "This code provides a converter class for country names and their corresponding country codes, allowing conversion and reverse conversion between country alpha-2 codes and country names.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported COUNTRY_MATRIX object during class initialization, specifically iterating over its elements to populate mappings.",
  "sinks": "The convert() and reverse() methods raise custom exceptions if inputs are invalid; no external untrusted data handling or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input country codes or names are checked against internal mappings, and corresponding data is returned or exceptions are raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code uses standard data structures and pattern for conversion, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes internal mappings from a presumably predefined COUNTRY_MATRIX, which is a common pattern for lookup tables. Methods perform validation against these mappings, raising specific exceptions for invalid inputs. There are no external data fetches, network calls, or file operations. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to standard coding practices. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a country code-name converter with no malicious intent or security risks. It primarily serves as a lookup utility with proper validation and exception handling.",
