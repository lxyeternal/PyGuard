{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for converting country codes to country names and vice versa, utilizing data from a country matrix.",
  "sources": "Imports from the country module (COUNTRY_MATRIX), the constructor reading country data, and the convert/reverse methods reading input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The convert and reverse methods raise custom exceptions if input data is invalid, but do not perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input alpha2 code flows into convert method to retrieve country name; input name flows into reverse method to retrieve alpha2 code. These are straightforward mappings with exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard exception handling and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes mappings between country alpha2 codes and country names from a country matrix. It uses standard Python data structures and imports. The convert and reverse methods validate input against these mappings and raise specific exceptions if invalid. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The code is clean, purpose-specific, and does not contain hidden or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward country code-name converter with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs expected data mappings with proper validation and error handling.",
