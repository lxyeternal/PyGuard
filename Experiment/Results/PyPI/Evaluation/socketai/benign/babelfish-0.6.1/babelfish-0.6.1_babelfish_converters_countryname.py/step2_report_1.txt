  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's logic, and assess the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward utility class for converting country alpha2 codes to country names and vice versa.\n- It relies on an external data structure `COUNTRY_MATRIX`, which is assumed to contain country data.\n- The methods perform lookups and raise custom exceptions on invalid input.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Accurate description.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a simple mapping utility with proper validation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=1`.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the utility nature and safe validation.\n- **Scores:** Same as above, `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=1`.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Slightly lower confidence (`0.9`) but still indicates a standard utility.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.1`.\n\n**Discussion:** The `securityRisk=0.1` seems overly cautious for such a simple mapping utility. No external data fetches or risky operations are present. I would suggest lowering this to 0 unless there's additional context.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Consistent with previous reports, confirming no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Similar assessment: standard, safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across the board, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher in report 3 (`0.1`) due to possibly overcautious labeling. Given the code's simplicity, I recommend lowering it to 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code itself is a standard data mapping utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable, except for the minor security risk in report 3, which should be 0.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores for this code:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is safe, straightforward, and does not pose any security threat. The scoring should reflect that with zero malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
