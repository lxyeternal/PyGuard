  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the class's function and data source.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; the methods perform straightforward lookups with exception handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code detected; standard data mapping.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; no security concerns.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward validation and exception raising.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- Confidence is high.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same core analysis: data mappings, validation, exception handling, no external data fetches or malicious behavior.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very minimal; perhaps considering very slight risk, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- Both reinforce the straightforward nature of the code, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity.  \n- High confidence and consistent scoring.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears to be a standard utility for country code-name conversion, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No external data fetching, code injection, or dynamic execution. Exception handling is standard.\n- **Obfuscation & malware:** The code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly assign zero or negligible scores for malware and obfuscation. The security risk scores are also appropriately low.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard utility with no supply chain security issues.**",
