  "purpose": "A utility class for converting country alpha2 codes to country names and vice versa, using data from COUNTRY_MATRIX.",
  "sources": "Initialization from COUNTRY_MATRIX, which provides country data including name and alpha2 code.",
  "sinks": "The convert() and reverse() methods perform lookups; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Input alpha2 code flows into convert() -> lookup in to_name -> output; input name flows into reverse() -> lookup in from_name -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward data mappings with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured utility for country code and name conversion. It initializes mappings from a trusted data source, performs lookups with validation, and raises specific exceptions on invalid input. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, network activity, or dynamic execution. The exception handling is standard, and the code's purpose is benign. External data source COUNTRY_MATRIX is assumed to be safe; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward country code-name converter with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
