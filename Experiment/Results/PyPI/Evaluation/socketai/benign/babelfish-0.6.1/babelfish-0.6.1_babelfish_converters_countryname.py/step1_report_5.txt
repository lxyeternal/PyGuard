{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for converting country codes to country names and vice versa, using a predefined matrix of country data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported COUNTRY_MATRIX and class attributes during initialization, and also uses input parameters in convert() and reverse() methods.",
  "sinks": "The convert() and reverse() methods raise exceptions if inputs are invalid; these are not sinks for untrusted data but validation points.",
  "flows": "Input alpha2 code flows into convert() and name flows into reverse(). These inputs are checked against internal dictionaries to produce corresponding outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard Python practices and libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for country code and name conversion based on a predefined dataset. It initializes mappings from the COUNTRY_MATRIX, which is assumed to be a structured collection of country data. The convert() method retrieves country names given alpha2 codes, raising exceptions if not found. The reverse() method retrieves alpha2 codes given country names, also raising exceptions if not found. All operations are validation-based and involve standard data structures without any suspicious or malicious logic. No external data fetching, system modifications, or network activity is present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for country code conversion, with proper error handling and no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a secure utility for country code conversion with proper validation and exception handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code snippet.",
