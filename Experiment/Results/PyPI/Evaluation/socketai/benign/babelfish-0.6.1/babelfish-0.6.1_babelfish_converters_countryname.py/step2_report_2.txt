  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code appears to be a straightforward country code-to-name converter with reverse lookup, using data from `COUNTRY_MATRIX`.\n- The logic involves initializing mappings in the constructor and providing conversion methods with exception handling.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is evident.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain suspicious patterns.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard utility, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify the purpose, data flow, and validation logic.\n- The descriptions are consistent, and no report mentions any flaw or vulnerability.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1—this seems slightly cautious but still reasonable, as the code is a utility without external dependencies or side effects.\n- The scores seem consistent with the code's purpose and the analysis.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- No scores above 0.5 are assigned, so no justification needed here.\n\n**Step 5: Address potential assumptions and suspicious claims**\n\n- All reports correctly state that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The data source `COUNTRY_MATRIX` is assumed to be safe and structured properly.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious code injection.\n\n**Step 6: Cross-validate the scores with the code**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, matching the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- The security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the utility nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (a cautious but reasonable estimate considering the code's benign utility role)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for country code and name conversion. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is present. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign utility with negligible security concerns.",
