  "purpose": "This source code defines classes and functions for handling country data, including converting country codes and managing country information based on ISO-3166 standards.",
  "sources": "Reads from resource stream 'babelfish/data/iso-3166-1.txt' to load country codes and names.",
  "sinks": "Uses the loaded country data internally; no direct data sinks or external data outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the resource stream into in-memory structures, then through class methods and attributes for country code validation and conversion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Usage of partial functions for dynamic method creation is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads ISO country data from a resource file into dictionaries and named tuples, then defines a Country class with methods for validation, creation from codes, and attribute access. The class uses a metaclass to dynamically redirect method calls based on converter names. No external network calls, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors are present. The resource stream and data handling are straightforward. The code relies on external converter managers but does not contain any suspicious or malicious code logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for country data management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
