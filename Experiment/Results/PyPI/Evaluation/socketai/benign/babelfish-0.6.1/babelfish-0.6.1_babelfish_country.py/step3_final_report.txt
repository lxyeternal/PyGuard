  "purpose": "Manage country data and conversions based on ISO-3166 standards, providing dynamic methods for reverse lookup using external converters.",
  "sources": "Resource stream reading 'iso-3166-1.txt'; external converter registry accessed via attribute and method calls.",
  "sinks": "External converters invoked in __getattr__ and fromcode; no direct data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Resource stream loads data into COUNTRIES and COUNTRY_MATRIX; dynamic attribute/method calls invoke converters for reverse lookup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for dynamic method creation; reliance on external converter registry; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads country data from a resource file, defines a Country class with dynamic methods via __getattr__, and uses external converters for reverse lookup. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The dynamic attribute access could be misused if converter names are externally controlled, but in controlled environments, this pattern is standard. The data loading and class design are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily handling data and providing flexible conversion methods. No malware or obfuscation detected. The slight security concern regarding dynamic method creation is minimal and typical in plugin architectures, assuming trusted converter names.",
