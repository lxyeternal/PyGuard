{
  "purpose": "This code manages country data, including loading ISO-3166 country codes, converting country representations, and providing country objects with conversion capabilities.",
  "sources": "Resource stream to read country data from 'iso-3166-1.txt'; data parsing from the file; attribute access for conversions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data is written or used insecurely; attribute access for conversion may indirectly call external converter functions.",
  "flows": "File data read -> parsed into country objects -> stored in dictionaries and lists; attribute access on Country instances may invoke converters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of resource_stream for reading data is standard; dynamic attribute access (__getattr__) for converters is flexible but potentially risky if converters are maliciously overridden; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code identified; no evidence of obfuscated code or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code loads country data from a resource file and constructs Country objects with validation. It employs a metaclass to allow dynamic method calls like frommycode. Attribute access (__getattr__) allows for calling converters dynamically, which could be a vector if converters are malicious but is typical in plugin architectures. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident. The code does not perform network operations or system modifications. It depends on external converters which could be malicious if compromised, but within this code, the behavior is standard for data management and conversion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily focused on country data management with standard practices. There is no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior within this module. The use of dynamic converters could be a potential vector if converters are compromised, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
