  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the associated scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard utility module for resource and entry point management, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n- The code primarily performs version-dependent imports, resource access via `files(pkg).joinpath().open()`, and entry point handling via `entry_points().select()`.\n- The `EntryPoint.parse()` method splits a string on '=' and creates an EntryPoint object; this is straightforward and not suspicious.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code's purpose aligns with typical plugin/resource management, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Reasoning:** No malicious activity or payload detected.\n- **Score review:** Appropriate.\n\n### Issue 2\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Reasoning:** Same as above; no malware present.\n- **Score review:** Appropriate.\n\n### Issue 3\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Reasoning:** No malicious behavior; the code is a utility module.\n- **Score review:** Appropriate.\n\n### Issue 4\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Reasoning:** No malicious activity; standard compatibility code.\n- **Score review:** Appropriate.\n\n### Issue 5\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Reasoning:** No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- **Score review:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n### Security risk:\n- All reports assign very low scores (0.1 or 0.2), which seem reasonable given the code's nature. Since the code handles resources and entry points without untrusted data or network activity, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal security concern, mainly due to resource handling, which is standard)\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, version-compatible utility module for resource and entry point management. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.",
