  "purpose": "Utility functions for resource management and entry point handling, supporting different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, importlib.resources, importlib_metadata, and importlib_resources modules; function parameters (pkg, path, group).",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as files(pkg).joinpath(f'{path}').open('rb') and entry_points().select(group=group, **kwargs); no direct sink for untrusted data is apparent.",
  "flows": "resource_stream uses pkg and path to access resources; iter_entry_points retrieves entry points based on group; EntryPoint.parse processes a string to create an EntryPoint object; EntryPoint.resolve loads the entry point.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic resource access and entry point parsing. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Code adapts to Python version differences.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions and a class for resource handling and plugin entry points, with compatibility for multiple Python versions. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior identified. The dynamic parsing and resource loading are standard for plugin systems, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard resource and plugin management utilities without any malicious behavior or security risks. It employs version checks for compatibility and does not include any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
