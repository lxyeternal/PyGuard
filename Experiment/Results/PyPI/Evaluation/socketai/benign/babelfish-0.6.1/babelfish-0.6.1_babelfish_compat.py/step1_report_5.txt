{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes to access package resources and entry points, supporting different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads system Python version info (_python), imports modules, and processes input parameters in methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions detected.",
  "flows": "Uses version info to conditionally import modules, then provides resource streams and entry point iteration, and parses entry point strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Code appears standard for compatibility handling and resource access.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports modules based on Python version, accesses package resources, and manages entry points. The resource_stream function reads binary data from package resources, and iter_entry_points retrieves entry points for a group. The EntryPoint class parses entry point strings and loads them. All functions follow standard patterns for package resource and entry point management. No data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior is apparent. The code structure is typical and does not exhibit obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical utility for package resource and entry point management across Python versions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
