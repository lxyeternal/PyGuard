  "purpose": "Utility functions for resource streams and entry point management with Python version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads package data via files(pkg).joinpath().open() and retrieves entry points with entry_points().select().",
  "sinks": "Potentially uses untrusted parameters (pkg, path, group) for resource access and entry point selection.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (pkg, path, group) flow into resource_stream() and iter_entry_points(), which access package data and entry points respectively.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The parse() method simply splits strings; resolve() loads entry points normally.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility utility for package resource and entry point management across Python versions. It employs safe library functions, with no network activity or data exfiltration. The only minor concern is that parameters could be misused if untrusted, but the code itself does not process untrusted data or perform malicious actions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (around 0.1). The code's straightforward structure and use of standard libraries support a conclusion of no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for resource and entry point handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate, reflecting minimal concern primarily about parameter trust, which is outside the code's direct control.",
