{
  "purpose": "A utility class to convert language alpha-3 codes into descriptive names based on a predefined language matrix.",
  "sources": "The class reads from the static LANGUAGE_MATRIX to populate the SYMBOLS dictionary during class definition.",
  "sinks": "The convert() method uses the alpha3 parameter to perform a lookup; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input alpha3 code flows from the convert() method into the SYMBOLS dictionary lookup, then to the FULLNAME mapping or exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward static data lookup with standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that initializes a SYMBOLS dictionary from LANGUAGE_MATRIX at class load time, mapping ISO alpha-3 language codes to their types. The convert() method retrieves the type for a given alpha3 code and returns a descriptive name from FULLNAME or raises a controlled exception. No network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The logic is simple, safe, and standard for such utility functions. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or external data handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk mostly 0 or 0.1) are consistent with this assessment. The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in some reports appears overly cautious, as the code does not pose any security threat. Overall, the code is a straightforward, safe language code-to-description converter with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a simple static lookup, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, though the security risk score could be confidently set to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness.",
