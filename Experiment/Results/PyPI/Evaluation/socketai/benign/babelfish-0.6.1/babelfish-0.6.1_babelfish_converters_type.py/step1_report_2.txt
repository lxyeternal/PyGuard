{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for converting language type codes to descriptive names based on predefined mappings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the LANGUAGE_MATRIX imported from the language module to build a SYMBOLS dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The convert() method uses the SYMBOLS dictionary for lookups; it does not directly involve untrusted data input or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from LANGUAGE_MATRIX into SYMBOLS, then from convert() input (alpha3) into SYMBOLS for lookup, resulting in a returned descriptive string or an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious code patterns. The use of exception handling for errors is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class that extends LanguageConverter. It constructs a SYMBOLS dictionary mapping language codes to types from LANGUAGE_MATRIX. The convert() method retrieves the language type for a given alpha3 code and returns a descriptive name if found, or raises an error otherwise. There are no apparent security issues, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation techniques. The code appears to be a straightforward mapping implementation with standard exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign language type conversion utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
