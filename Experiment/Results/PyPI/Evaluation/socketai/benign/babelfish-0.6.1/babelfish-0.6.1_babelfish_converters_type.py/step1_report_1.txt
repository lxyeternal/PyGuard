{
  "purpose": "This code defines a language type converter class that maps language codes to descriptive names based on a predefined matrix and provides conversion functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported modules (LANGUAGE_MATRIX) and class attributes (alpha3, type).",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the conversion method which could potentially raise exceptions; no other sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The convert() method takes an alpha3 code, looks up its type in SYMBOLS, and returns a descriptive name from FULLNAME, or raises an exception.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a dynamic population of the SYMBOLS dictionary from LANGUAGE_MATRIX at class definition time, which is not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines a class for converting language codes. It initializes a dictionary SYMBOLS mapping ISO language codes to their types based on LANGUAGE_MATRIX. The convert method checks if the code exists in SYMBOLS and returns a descriptive name if so; otherwise, it raises a custom exception. There are no external inputs, network operations, or malicious code patterns. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for a utility class. The only dynamic behavior is the population of SYMBOLS during class load, which is normal in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate language code conversion utility with no malicious intent. It reads data from a predefined language matrix, performs safe lookups, and raises controlled exceptions when needed. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
