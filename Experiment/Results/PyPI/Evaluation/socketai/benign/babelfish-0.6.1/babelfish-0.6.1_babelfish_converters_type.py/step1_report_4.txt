{
  "purpose": "This code defines a language type converter class that maps language codes to descriptive names based on a predefined matrix.",
  "sources": "The code reads the LANGUAGE_MATRIX imported from another module and takes 'alpha3' language codes as input in the convert method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or output untrusted data but raises an exception (LanguageConvertError) if conversion fails.",
  "flows": "Input 'alpha3' code is checked against SYMBOLS dictionary; if found, a descriptive string is returned; if not, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The dynamic creation of SYMBOLS from LANGUAGE_MATRIX is standard. No external inputs or network activities are involved.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it initializes a mapping from language codes to types, then provides a conversion method that looks up these codes. The only data source is LANGUAGE_MATRIX, which is presumably a static data structure. The conversion method raises an exception if the code is unrecognized. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or backdoors. No external data handling or code injection points are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign language code converter with no malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on predefined static data and performs simple lookups and error handling.",
