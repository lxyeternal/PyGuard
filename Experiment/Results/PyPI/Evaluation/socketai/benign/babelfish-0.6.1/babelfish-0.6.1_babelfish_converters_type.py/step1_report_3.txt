  "purpose": "The code defines a language type converter class for mapping language codes to descriptive names.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'alpha3' parameter in the convert method and accessing the LANGUAGE_MATRIX data during class definition.",
  "sinks": "Raising LanguageConvertError if a code is not found; no data output or external data sink involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'alpha3' -> lookup in SYMBOLS -> check in FULLNAME -> return descriptive string or raise error.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class for language code conversion. It initializes a mapping of language symbols based on LANGUAGE_MATRIX and provides a method to convert a language code to a descriptive name. The class and method perform straightforward data lookups and error handling without external communication, dynamic code execution, or data leakage mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard language converter implementation with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended for its purpose, with safe data handling practices.",
