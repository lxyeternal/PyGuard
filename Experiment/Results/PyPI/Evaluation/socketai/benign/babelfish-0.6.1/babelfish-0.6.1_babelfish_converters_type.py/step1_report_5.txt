{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for converting language types based on a given alpha-3 code, using a predefined language matrix.",
  "sources": "The code reads the LANGUAGE_MATRIX and the method parameters 'alpha3', 'country', 'script'.",
  "sinks": "The code raises an exception (LanguageConvertError) when conversion fails; no external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'alpha3' is used to index into SYMBOLS; depending on the value, it may return a string or raise an error.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The dynamic creation of SYMBOLS from LANGUAGE_MATRIX is normal. No obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports language data, defines a class with constants, and constructs a SYMBOLS dictionary mapping ISO language codes to types. The convert method checks if a given code exists and maps it accordingly, raising an exception if not. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard language type converter with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on an external language matrix and handles errors appropriately.",
