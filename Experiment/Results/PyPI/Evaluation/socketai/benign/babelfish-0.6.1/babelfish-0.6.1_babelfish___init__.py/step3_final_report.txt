  "purpose": "Initialize environment compatibility and import localization modules for language, country, and script conversions.",
  "sources": "Python version info via sys.version_info; static import statements for modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static imports and version check without data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version check and module imports with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a Python version check to define a string type alias and imports multiple modules related to localization. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity. The structure is typical for a setup or compatibility module, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard setup for a localization library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, with high confidence.",
  "confidence": 1,
