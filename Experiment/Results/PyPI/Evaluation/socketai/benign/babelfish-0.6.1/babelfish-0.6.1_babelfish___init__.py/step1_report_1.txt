{
  "purpose": "Define compatibility for string types based on Python version and import various modules related to language, country, and script conversions.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.version_info to determine Python version; importing modules and classes from relative package structure.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations; imports are static and do not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The version check for string types is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles compatibility for string types based on Python version and imports multiple components from the package. There are no external input reads, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be standard library setup code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a typical module initialization and import section, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs version-based type compatibility and imports modules essential for language and country conversion functionality.",
