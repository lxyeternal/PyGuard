{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize compatibility for Python 2 and 3 and imports various modules related to language and country conversions, likely for internationalization or localization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports and compatibility variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code is standard for a localization library setup.",
  "analysis": "The script checks Python version and assigns a string type alias accordingly. It then imports several modules related to language and country conversions. These are typical setup steps for a Python package that handles internationalization. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden behaviors. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard initialization and import setup for a localization library. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply prepares the environment for further processing by importing necessary modules.",
