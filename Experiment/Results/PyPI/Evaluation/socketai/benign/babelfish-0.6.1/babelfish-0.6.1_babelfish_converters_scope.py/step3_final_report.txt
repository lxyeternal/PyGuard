{
  "purpose": "Map language scope codes (e.g., 'I', 'M', 'S') to descriptive names ('individual', 'macrolanguage', 'special') based on language data.",
  "sources": "Reads language codes (alpha3) and the LANGUAGE_MATRIX data source for scope information.",
  "sinks": "Returns descriptive scope names or raises an exception; no untrusted data sinks or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Input alpha3 code -> lookup in SYMBOLS derived from LANGUAGE_MATRIX -> return scope description or raise error.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward data mapping for language scope codes, constructing SYMBOLS from LANGUAGE_MATRIX. The convert method retrieves scope info and returns a descriptive name, raising an error if not found. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or external system interactions are present. The code is well-structured, domain-specific, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent. Minor robustness improvement could be handling missing keys gracefully, but this does not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, secure language scope converter with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. It is well-implemented and trustworthy.",
