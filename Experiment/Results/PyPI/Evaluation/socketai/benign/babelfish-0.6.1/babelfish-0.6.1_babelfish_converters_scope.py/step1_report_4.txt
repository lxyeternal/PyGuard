{
  "purpose": "Define a class for converting language scope codes to descriptive strings based on a language matrix.",
  "sources": "Language matrix (LANGUAGE_MATRIX) and input parameter 'alpha3'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input 'alpha3' is used to index SYMBOLS, which maps to scope descriptions, then returned or an error is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The code appears straightforward and typical for data mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class ScopeConverter that inherits from LanguageConverter. It initializes a dictionary SYMBOLS mapping ISO language codes to scope categories based on LANGUAGE_MATRIX. The convert method retrieves scope info for a given alpha3 code and returns a descriptive string from FULLNAME if available; otherwise, it raises a custom exception. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious logic. The code performs simple data mapping without external side effects or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard language scope mapping implementation with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It solely performs data lookup and transformation based on provided language codes.",
