{
  "purpose": "Define a class for converting language scope codes to descriptive names within a language conversion framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from the same package and a language matrix for language data.",
  "sinks": "The convert method uses input parameters alpha3, country, script; no external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input alpha3 is checked against SYMBOLS and mapped to FULLNAME; potential flow from user input to return value.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No use of eval, exec, or insecure data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that extends a language converter, initializing a dictionary based on the language matrix. The convert method looks up a code in the SYMBOLS dictionary and returns a descriptive string from FULLNAME. It raises an error if the code is not found. The code appears to be a straightforward, domain-specific implementation with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. No external network or file I/O is present, and no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a language scope converter with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs data lookup and mapping within a controlled context.",
