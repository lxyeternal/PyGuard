  "purpose": "Define a class ScopeConverter for converting language scope codes to descriptive names based on a language matrix.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, local modules (LanguageConverter, exceptions, language), iteration over LANGUAGE_MATRIX.",
  "sinks": "convert method accessing self.SYMBOLS[alpha3], potential exception raising.",
  "flows": "Input alpha3 passes through convert method, retrieves scope from SYMBOLS, maps to FULLNAME, or raises exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, no unusual variable names or obfuscation. No external network activity or system modification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from LanguageConverter, with a mapping of language scope codes to descriptive names. It initializes SYMBOLS with data from LANGUAGE_MATRIX, then uses convert to return scope descriptions or raise an error. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, external data access, or dangerous behavior observed. The structure and imports are standard for a localization library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward language scope converter module with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected data lookups and exception handling without suspicious behavior.",
