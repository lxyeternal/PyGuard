{
  "purpose": "Defines a ScopeConverter class for converting language scope codes to full names based on language data.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, local module imports (__init__.py), and the LANGUAGE_MATRIX data.",
  "targets": "Uses self.SYMBOLS[alpha3] to access scope information and raises LanguageConvertError on invalid input.",
  "flows": "Input alpha3 code flows into the convert method, which retrieves scope info from SYMBOLS and may raise an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a class with a mapping of language scope codes to descriptive names, constructs a SYMBOLS dictionary from LANGUAGE_MATRIX, and implements a convert method that maps alpha3 codes to scope names, raising an error if not found. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to perform legitimate data transformation for language scope conversion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward language scope converter with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard data structures and proper exception handling. No malicious intent detected.",
