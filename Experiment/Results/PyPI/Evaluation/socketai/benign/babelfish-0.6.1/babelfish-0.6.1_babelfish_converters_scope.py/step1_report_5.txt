{
  "purpose": "Define a class for converting language scope identifiers to descriptive strings based on a language matrix.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'LANGUAGE_MATRIX' imported from the language module and input parameters to the convert method (alpha3, country, script).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files, nor are environment variables or network operations involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameter alpha3 is used to access SYMBOLS dictionary; the value is then checked against FULLNAME and returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward without obfuscated features, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class ScopeConverter that maps language scope codes to descriptive names. It initializes a SYMBOLS dictionary mapping ISO alpha-3 language codes to their scope. The convert method retrieves scope info for a given alpha3 code, then returns a human-readable string if available. It raises an error if the code isn't recognized. There are no external data injections, network calls, or suspicious logic. The code is simple, focused on data transformation, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data transformation class used for language scope conversion. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended within a language processing library.",
