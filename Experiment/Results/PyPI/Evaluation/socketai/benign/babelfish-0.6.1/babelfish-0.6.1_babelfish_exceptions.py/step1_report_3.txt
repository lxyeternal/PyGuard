  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for language and country conversion errors in the babelfish library.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes with constructors and string representations. There is no input handling, data manipulation, network communication, or other potentially malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard, well-structured Python exception definitions for a localization library. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for handling language and country conversion errors. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious features. It appears safe and standard.",
