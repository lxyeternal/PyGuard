{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for language and country conversion errors in the babelfish library.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; only class definitions and initializations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or handling of untrusted input is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; exception classes are used internally for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class inheritance with no suspicious or unusual constructs, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for error handling related to language and country conversions. It includes standard constructor methods and string representations. There are no external inputs, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The classes serve as data structures for error reporting within the library, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of class definitions for exception handling in a language processing library. It shows no evidence of malware, security risks, or suspicious behavior.",
