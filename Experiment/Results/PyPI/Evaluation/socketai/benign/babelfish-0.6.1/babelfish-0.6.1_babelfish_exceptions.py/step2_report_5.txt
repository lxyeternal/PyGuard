  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for language and country conversion errors.\n- They note that the code is straightforward, contains no external data handling, no network calls, no obfuscation, and no malicious constructs.\n- The code is standard Python exception class definitions with constructors and string methods.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified across all reports.\n\n**Confirmations and discrepancies:**\n- The code matches the described purpose perfectly.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- The reports are highly consistent and do not identify any issues or inconsistencies.\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, the assigned scores seem appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is justified based on the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Malware score of 0: No malicious activity or code.\n- Obfuscated score of 0: No obfuscation detected.\n- Security risk score of 0: No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, well-structured, and free of security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no further action or adjustment is necessary.",
