  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Content Verification**:\n   - The code in question only defines custom exception classes with constructors and string methods.\n   - There are no external inputs, data processing, network calls, dynamic code execution, or any operations that could be malicious.\n   - The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python exception class patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The class design is conventional and appropriate for error handling.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious features, these scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Risk Justification**:\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n   - Exception classes are standard and do not execute or evaluate external data.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about potential vulnerabilities.\n   - They recognize the code as purely defining error classes with no malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The assigned scores align well with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious patterns)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final judgment**:\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a localization library. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation.\n\n**Note**: The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
