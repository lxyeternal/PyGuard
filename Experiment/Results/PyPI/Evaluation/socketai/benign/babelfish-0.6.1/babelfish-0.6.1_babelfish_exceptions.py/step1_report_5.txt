{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the babelfish library related to language and country conversions.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code primarily defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output of untrusted data occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines exception classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, defining exception classes with simple constructors and string representations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions, with no data processing, user input, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The exception classes are standard and do not perform any dangerous operations or access external data. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code is simple, clear, and aligns with typical Python exception handling patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides custom exception classes for use within the babelfish library. It poses no security threat and has a high confidence of being safe.",
