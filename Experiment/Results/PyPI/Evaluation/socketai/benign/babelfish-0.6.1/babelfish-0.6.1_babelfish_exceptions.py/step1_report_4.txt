  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the babelfish library related to language and country conversion errors.",
  "sources": "No input or external data read; exception class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code contains only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to language and country conversions. It includes constructors and string representations for error messages. There is no input handling, data processing, or external communication. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The license and copyright comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error handling within the babelfish library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
