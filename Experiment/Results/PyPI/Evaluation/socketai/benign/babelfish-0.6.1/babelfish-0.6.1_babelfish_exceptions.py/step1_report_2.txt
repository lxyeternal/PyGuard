{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for language and country conversion errors in the babelfish library.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions and initializes exception objects with parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only exception object creation and string representation methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard class and exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes with constructors and string methods. No input/output handling, network communication, or data processing occurs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code adheres to typical Python exception class patterns and does not execute or evaluate external inputs or commands.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely for exception handling within a library and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.",
