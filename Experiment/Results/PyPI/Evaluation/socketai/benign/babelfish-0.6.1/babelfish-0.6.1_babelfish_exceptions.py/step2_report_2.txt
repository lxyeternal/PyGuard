  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Content and Functionality Check**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes with constructors and string representations. There are no data flows, external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The classes serve as data structures for error reporting within the library.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**  \nAll reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and follows standard Python exception class patterns. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.  \n- They correctly state that there are no security risks, malware, or suspicious behaviors.  \n- They do not overlook any potential issues such as accidental inclusion of dangerous code or hidden backdoors, which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**  \n- The `malware` score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.  \n- The `securityRisk` score is 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.  \n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores**  \n- Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions with no external interactions, the risk scores should remain at 0.  \n- The reports' confidence scores are all 1, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n6. **Potential for Hidden Issues or Assumptions**  \n- The reports assume that class definitions are harmless, which is correct.  \n- No assumptions about external data or malicious intent are made, and this is appropriate.\n\n**Final Assessment and Recommendations:**  \n- The code is entirely benign and poses no security threat.  \n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and should remain unchanged.  \n- The detailed analysis confirms the code's safety and correctness.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
