{
  "purpose": "The code provides a pytest plugin for incremental testing based on dependency analysis, managing dependency graphs, and determining outdated tests.",
  "sources": "Data reads from JSON files (deps.json), filesystem operations (os.path, glob.glob), and input from command-line options (pytest options).",
  "sinks": "Writing dependency graphs to dot and SVG files, printing to STDOUT, executing shell commands (dot -Tsvg), and interacting with the pytest test execution lifecycle.",
  "flows": "The code loads dependency data from deps.json, uses filesystem scans to identify modules, and generates task actions that write files or output dependency info. It triggers external commands (dot) for graph visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. External command construction uses static strings. No backdoors or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a pytest plugin with task management, dependency graph creation, and incremental testing logic. It loads dependency data from a JSON file, generates dependency graphs, and outputs visualizations. The plugin interacts with filesystem and external commands solely for visualization purposes. It manages test selection based on dependency changes, marking tests as outdated or up-to-date, and stores results in a local database file. No suspicious code, hidden network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to serve its purpose of supporting incremental testing safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate pytest plugin designed for dependency tracking and incremental test execution. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are identified. It performs filesystem operations, external command execution for visualization, and interacts with pytest lifecycle hooks without any suspicious patterns.",
