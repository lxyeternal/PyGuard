  "purpose": "A pytest plugin for dependency analysis, incremental testing, and visualization of module dependencies, integrating with pytest lifecycle hooks to manage test selection based on dependency changes.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reading (JSON files, modules), command-line options, and external commands (dot for graph visualization).",
  "sinks": "Writes JSON dependency data, dot and SVG graph files, outputs to stdout, executes external 'dot' command.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON and filesystem data, generates dependency graphs, calls external visualization tools, and outputs test status info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. External command usage is static and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency graph creation, visualization, and test management using standard libraries and patterns. It interacts with filesystem, JSON, and external visualization tools in a typical manner. No network activity, code injection, or dynamic execution that could be exploited. The external 'dot' command is used in a controlled, static way. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and integrates seamlessly with pytest hooks. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured pytest plugin for dependency tracking and incremental testing. It performs filesystem operations, generates dependency graphs, and manages test execution based on dependency changes without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are accurate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
