{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to add 5 to an input and then sums the result with data from an imported module.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'a' for the function plus5.",
  "sinks": "The call to mod1.sum with the expression 5 + a as an argument.",
  "flows": "Input 'a' is used to compute 5 + a, which is then passed to mod1.sum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named mod1 and defines a function plus5 that adds 5 to its parameter 'a'. It then calls mod1.sum with the result of 5 + a. There is no evidence of malicious intent; the code appears straightforward. It relies on an external module for summation, which is not suspicious by itself. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is a basic utility function performing addition and summation via an imported module.",
