{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pytest-incremental' package, facilitating its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to vulnerabilities. The script primarily reads a local file and calls setup() with static data.",
  "flows": "Reading local README file (source) and passing static metadata to setup() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets. All data is static and obtained from a local file or hardcoded strings.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file from the local filesystem, then calls the setup() function with package metadata. The dependencies and metadata are static, and there is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely reads a local README file and supplies static package metadata to the setup() function.",
