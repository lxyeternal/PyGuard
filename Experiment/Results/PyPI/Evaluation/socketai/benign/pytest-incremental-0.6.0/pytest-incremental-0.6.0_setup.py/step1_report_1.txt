  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pytest-incremental', used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file from the filesystem; importing os.path; importing setup from distutils.core.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processed in a way that leads to security issues.",
  "flows": "The script reads the README file, then passes static metadata and dependencies to setup(), with no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious logic are present. Usage of standard setup procedures and library calls.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static setup configuration, reading a README file from disk and passing fixed package metadata and dependencies to the setup() function. It uses standard Python libraries and follows typical packaging conventions. No input validation, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity are present. All dependencies and data sources are static and controlled. The script does not contain obfuscated code or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup file for the 'pytest-incremental' package.",
