{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pytest-incremental' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file; static code defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data outputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' and assigning to README_TEXT; then using static data for package configuration and installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a local README file for description content, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No user input, network operations, or untrusted data are processed. No obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior detected. The dependencies are standard and version-controlled, and no code appears to be malicious or maliciously obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs standard package installation procedures securely.",
