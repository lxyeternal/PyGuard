  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project, reading a local README file for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading local file 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; static data used throughout.",
  "flows": "Reading local file -> passing static metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports os.path and distutils.core.setup, reads a local README file, and calls setup() with fixed metadata, dependencies, and URLs. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated logic. All data sources and flows are static and controlled. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard packaging practices indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals confirm its safety, and the scores should reflect zero malware, zero obfuscation, and zero security risk.",
