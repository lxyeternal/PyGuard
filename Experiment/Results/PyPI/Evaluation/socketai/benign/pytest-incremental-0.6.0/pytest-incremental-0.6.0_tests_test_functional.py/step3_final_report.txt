{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest test functions and utilities for managing test execution, reporting, and plugin features.",
  "sources": "Test files created in memory, internal pytest report objects, standard input parameters, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or system modifications beyond test environment manipulation.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke pytest runs, process internal report objects, and output results; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.modules to delete modules is unconventional but not malicious; no suspicious code obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, focusing on testing pytest plugin features, with no network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns. The use of sys.modules for module deletion is a common testing practice, not indicative of malicious intent. No external data or system modifications are performed. The code is well-structured, readable, and free of obfuscation. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified by the module manipulation but does not pose a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use.",
