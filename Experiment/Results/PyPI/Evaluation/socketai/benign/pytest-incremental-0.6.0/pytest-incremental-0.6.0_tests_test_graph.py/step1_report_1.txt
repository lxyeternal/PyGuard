{
  "purpose": "The code defines test cases for classes GNode and DepGraph, which are likely part of a dependency graph management or visualization library.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data for node names, dependencies, and graph structures; no external input or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code writes output to StringIO, which is a safe in-memory stream.",
  "flows": "Data flows from predefined structures into class instances and methods; no untrusted data propagates to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises unit tests that instantiate classes, add dependencies, and verify behaviors. There are no indications of malicious activities such as network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The data is static, and no dynamic or external inputs are processed. The functions primarily perform assertions on class methods and data structures. The overall structure and logic appear standard for testing dependency graphs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for dependency graph classes. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscated components.",
