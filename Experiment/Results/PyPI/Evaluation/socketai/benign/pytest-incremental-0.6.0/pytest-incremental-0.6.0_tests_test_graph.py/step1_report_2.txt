{
  "purpose": "The code contains unit tests for classes GNode and DepGraph, which are likely part of a dependency graph management library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from string literals, class instances, and the imported modules. It does not take external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write to external systems, files, or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily manipulates internal data structures and performs assertions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward test cases with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. There are no hidden dynamic code executions, eval, exec, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of unit test classes for GNode and DepGraph, verifying functionality such as dependency addition, recursive dependency resolution, cycle detection, and topological sorting. It uses test data and standard assertions. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The use of import statements from external libraries is standard for test code. No external data input, network activity, or secret handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests for dependency graph classes with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard test suite verifying correctness of dependency management logic.",
