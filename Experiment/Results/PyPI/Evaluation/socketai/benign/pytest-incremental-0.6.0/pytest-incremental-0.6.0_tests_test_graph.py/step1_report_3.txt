{
  "purpose": "This code contains unit tests for classes GNode and DepGraph, used for dependency graph management and visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input through test method calls, object initializations, and data passed into class constructors and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or security effects; the code does not write to external systems or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code flows are confined within object method calls and data structures, with no external untrusted data or dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. Usage of __future__ import is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for dependency graph classes, verifying dependencies, recursion, caching, and topological sorts. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are observed. The code uses only in-memory objects and standard testing practices. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing dependency graph classes with no malicious behavior detected. It involves standard unit testing code with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
