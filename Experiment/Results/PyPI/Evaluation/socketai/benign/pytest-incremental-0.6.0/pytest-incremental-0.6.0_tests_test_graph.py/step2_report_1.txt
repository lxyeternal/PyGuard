  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a set of unit tests for classes GNode and DepGraph.\n- They emphasize that the code uses static data, no external input, and no external sinks or network activity.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n- The code appears straightforward, with standard testing practices.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any network calls, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- The use of StringIO and in-memory data streams is safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The tests are standard, verifying dependency addition, recursive dependencies, cycle detection, and topological sorting.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is purely test code, it inherently lacks malicious activity.\n- The only minor note is that the code imports from `pytest_incremental`, but this is a testing library, not suspicious.\n- No evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The existing scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- malware score: 0\n- obfuscated score: 0\n- security risk score: 0\n\n**Final remarks:**\n- The code is a standard, safe test suite for dependency graph classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements are present.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code.",
