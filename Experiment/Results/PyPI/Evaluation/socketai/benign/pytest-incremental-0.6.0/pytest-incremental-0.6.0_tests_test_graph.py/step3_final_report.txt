{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for classes GNode and DepGraph, verifying dependency management, cycle detection, and topological sorting.",
  "sources": "Static data within test functions, such as node creation and dependency addition.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, output, or network activity is involved.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; all data flows are internal within the test cases and do not involve untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard testing practices, no obfuscated or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test cases for dependency graph classes, operating on static, in-memory data. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The tests verify dependency relationships, cycle detection, and sorting, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of 'pytest_incremental' and StringIO is safe and standard for testing. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence scores of 1 are justified given the straightforward, controlled test environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for dependency graph classes with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risks. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
