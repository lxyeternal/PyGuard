{
  "purpose": "This code provides unit tests for classes GNode and DepGraph, which model dependency graphs and their behaviors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; the code only uses in-memory data structures and class methods.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network operations, or external output beyond simple string output for DOT format.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows or data processing involving external inputs; focus is on internal logic and structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of standard testing libraries and straightforward class methods.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of unit tests for dependency graph classes, with no external data input, network activity, or code execution. All operations involve internal data structures and simple assertions. No indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be well-structured testing logic without obfuscated or malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard testing code for dependency graph structures with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated behavior. It does not contain any malware or security vulnerabilities based on the provided content.",
