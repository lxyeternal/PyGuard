  "purpose": "Function to compute the sum of two numbers",
  "sources": "No data input sources; function parameters 'a' and 'b' are direct inputs",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no external sinks involved",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow directly to the return statement without any modification",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple addition function with no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'sum' that takes two parameters and returns their sum. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leaks, obfuscated code, or harmful actions. The function is straightforward and does not perform any file operations, network communications, or secret handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and performs a simple addition operation without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
