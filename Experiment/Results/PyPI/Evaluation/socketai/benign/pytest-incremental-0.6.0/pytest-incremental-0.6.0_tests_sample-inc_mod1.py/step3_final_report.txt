{
  "purpose": "A simple addition function that returns the sum of two inputs.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a' and 'b' as input sources.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow directly to the return statement, producing the sum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic addition function with no external dependencies, side effects, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence, and assign zero scores for obfuscation, malware, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify these assessments. No anomalies or security concerns are present. The code performs a simple arithmetic operation, and the analysis aligns with this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
