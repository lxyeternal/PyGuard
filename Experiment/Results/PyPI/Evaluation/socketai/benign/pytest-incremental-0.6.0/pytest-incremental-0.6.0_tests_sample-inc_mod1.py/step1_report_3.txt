  "purpose": "The function sum is designed to return the sum of two input parameters.",
  "sources": "Inputs are the parameters 'a' and 'b' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the result of 'a + b'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameters 'a' and 'b' directly to the return statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a simple addition operation with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function that adds two parameters and returns the result. There are no external data sources, no user inputs, nor any data sinks that could leak information or execute malicious actions. The code is minimal and does not contain any complex logic, external calls, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic addition and does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be benign.",
