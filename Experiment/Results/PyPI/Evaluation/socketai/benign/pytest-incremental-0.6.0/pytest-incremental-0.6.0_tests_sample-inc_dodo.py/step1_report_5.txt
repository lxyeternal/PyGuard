{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to gather Python source and test files to create incremental build tasks using the pytest_incremental library.",
  "sources": "Reading file system with glob(\"*.py\") and glob(\"tt/*.py\") to list Python source and test files.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks such as network communication, file writing, or command execution observed.",
  "flows": "File paths obtained via glob are passed directly to IncrementalTasks; no transformations or external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports glob for filesystem operations and pytest_incremental for task management. It defines a function that collects Python source files and test files from specific directories. These file lists are combined and used to instantiate IncrementalTasks, which is then used to generate Doit tasks. The code appears straightforward and typical for setting up incremental testing workflows. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present; it merely automates task creation based on filesystem state.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for incremental task management, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply automates the collection of Python files for testing purposes.",
