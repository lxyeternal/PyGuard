  "purpose": "Collects Python source files and test files, initializes incremental testing tasks, and yields task creation commands.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads via glob for '*.py' and 'tt/*.py' files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data from glob → IncrementalTasks initialization → create_doit_tasks() → yield tasks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file collection and task setup with standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, collects source and test files using glob, initializes an IncrementalTasks object, and yields tasks. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The logic is typical for build automation scripts. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard file collection and task creation for testing automation, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
