  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration file (`conf.py`) with static assignments, imports of common modules (`sys`, `os`, `shlex`), and no dynamic or external input handling.\n- No evidence of data flow from untrusted sources, no network activity, no file manipulations beyond configuration, and no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores are also 0.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), indicating the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely static configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The presence of `shlex` is benign; it's imported but not used to execute commands.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- All reports are consistent in their reasoning and conclusions.\n\n**Evaluation of scores:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity is evident.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- Risk score: 0 is justified; the code is benign and does not pose security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The collective evidence strongly indicates this is a benign, standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: **0**\n- Obfuscated: **0**\n- Risk: **0**\n\nThis aligns with the reviewers' assessments and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the evidence, there is no indication of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent in this code snippet. It is a typical configuration file with no security concerns.",
