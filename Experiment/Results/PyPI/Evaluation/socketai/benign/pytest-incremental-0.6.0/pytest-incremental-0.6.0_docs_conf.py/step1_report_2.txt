  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation setup, defining project info, themes, extensions, and output options.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, os, shlex; defines configuration variables and lists (extensions, paths, output settings). No external data input or untrusted sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; configuration variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is standard for documentation configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with standard imports and settings. It does not execute or evaluate untrusted input, nor does it contain dynamic code execution, network operations, or other malicious patterns. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behaviors. The code is static and intended solely for documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The provided script is a normal Sphinx configuration file with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It purely configures documentation parameters without external data handling or security-sensitive operations.",
