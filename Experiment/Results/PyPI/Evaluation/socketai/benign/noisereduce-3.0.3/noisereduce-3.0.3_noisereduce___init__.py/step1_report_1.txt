{
  "purpose": "Import the 'reduce_noise' function from the 'noisereduce.noisereduce' module, likely for noise reduction in audio processing.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are explicitly read within this snippet; the import statement itself does not involve data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet; the code only imports a function.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as there are no data manipulations or function calls beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no unusual syntax or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a function from a legitimate open-source package intended for audio noise reduction. It does not execute any code or perform any operations that could be malicious. There are no sources, sinks, or flows indicating data manipulation or security risks. The structure and content are standard for Python modules importing dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a routine dependency import for audio processing tasks.",
