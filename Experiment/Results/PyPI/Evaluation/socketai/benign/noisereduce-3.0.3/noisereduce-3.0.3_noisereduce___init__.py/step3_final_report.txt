{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'reduce_noise' function from the 'noisereduce.noisereduce' library, likely for audio noise reduction tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the 'noisereduce' package installed in the environment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the import simply makes a function available for use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import of a known open-source library function, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The package 'noisereduce' is legitimate and used for audio noise reduction. The import does not execute any code or handle untrusted input. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. Confidence is high (1), as the code is simple and well-understood. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency import with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
