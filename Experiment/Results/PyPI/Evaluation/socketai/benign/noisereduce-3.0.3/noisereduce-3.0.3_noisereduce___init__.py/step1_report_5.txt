  "purpose": "Import the 'reduce_noise' function from the 'noisereduce.noisereduce' module, likely for audio noise reduction processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement, which loads a function from a third-party library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a specific function from an open-source library designed for noise reduction. It does not contain any input reading, data handling, or execution logic that could be malicious. As it is just an import statement, it cannot be used alone to perform any malicious activity. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign import statement for an open-source noise reduction function. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
