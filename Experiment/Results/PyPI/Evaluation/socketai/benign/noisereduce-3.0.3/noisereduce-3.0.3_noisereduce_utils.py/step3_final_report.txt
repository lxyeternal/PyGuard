  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting audio data between uint16 and float32 formats with normalization and validation.",
  "sources": "Input data to functions: 'data' parameter in both functions.",
  "sinks": "Type casting and normalization steps; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated and normalized within functions; no external data flow or untrusted sinks beyond local processing.",
  "anomalies": "Validation in 'int16_to_float32' checks for values above 32768, which may be conservative if data is unsigned, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard audio data conversions with basic validation, no external dependencies, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The validation logic is appropriate for typical audio data ranges, and no anomalies or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for audio data normalization and conversion, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
