{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting audio data between uint16 and float32 formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via function parameters 'data'.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical operations on 'data' and returns converted arrays.",
  "flows": "Input 'data' is scaled and converted within functions, with no external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard numpy functions and simple arithmetic operations. No obfuscation, no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The functions are straightforward conversions of audio data formats, with validation for maximum amplitude in 'int16_to_float32'. No external calls, network activities, or hidden code detected. The code appears benign, serving a typical purpose in audio processing pipelines. No suspicious behaviors or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a utility purpose for audio data conversion. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
