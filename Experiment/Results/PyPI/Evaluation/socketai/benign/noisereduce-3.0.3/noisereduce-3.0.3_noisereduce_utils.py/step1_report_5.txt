  "purpose": "Convert audio data between uint16 and float32 formats for processing or playback.",
  "sources": "The input parameters 'data' in both functions, which are numpy arrays representing audio samples.",
  "sinks": "The output of both functions, which are numpy arrays with different data types; no external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input numpy array -> data normalization and conversion -> output numpy array with specified dtype.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no external data transmission, no malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two straightforward conversion functions for audio data. The first function converts from uint16 to float32 by normalizing with 32768.0, and raises an error if data exceeds expected range. The second function normalizes float32 data if it exceeds 1, then converts to int16. Both functions use numpy operations without external dependencies or suspicious logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or backdoors. The functions perform typical data conversions used in audio processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for audio data format conversion with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe from a security perspective.",
