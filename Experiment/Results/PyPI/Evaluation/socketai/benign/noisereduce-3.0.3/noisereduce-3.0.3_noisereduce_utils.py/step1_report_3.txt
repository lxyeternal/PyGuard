  "purpose": "Convert audio data between uint16 and float32 formats for audio processing",
  "sources": "np.max, np.abs, data input to functions",
  "sinks": "np.max, data normalization and type casting",
  "flows": "Input data -> max value check -> normalization -> type casting",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions to convert audio data between uint16 and float32 formats. It performs value checks and normalization, with type conversions using numpy. No external network, file access, or suspicious operations are present. The code focuses solely on data type conversions and normalization, which are common in audio processing. No malicious intent or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard audio data conversion utility without malicious behavior. It performs safe normalization and type conversion operations. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
