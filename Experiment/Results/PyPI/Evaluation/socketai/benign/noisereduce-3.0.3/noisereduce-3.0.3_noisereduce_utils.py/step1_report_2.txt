{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for converting audio data between uint16 and float32 formats",
  "sources": "Data input is assumed to be provided as numerical arrays (e.g., numpy arrays)",
  "sinks": "Converted audio data returned as numpy arrays, no direct data leakage or external data transmission",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through normalization and type casting functions, output is the transformed array",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or suspicious code structures, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for converting audio data between uint16 and float32 formats, with input validation for data range. It performs standard normalization and type casting operations using numpy. There are no external data transmissions, backdoors, or malicious code. The functions appear to be straightforward utility functions for audio processing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module for audio data conversion without any malicious behavior or security issues.",
