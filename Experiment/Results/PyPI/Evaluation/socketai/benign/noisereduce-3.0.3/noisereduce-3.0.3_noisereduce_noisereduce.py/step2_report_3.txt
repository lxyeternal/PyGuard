  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs noise reduction via spectral gating, with options for stationary, non-stationary, or torch-based methods. No anomalies or suspicious features are observed.\n- **Security assessment:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code relies on standard imports and conditional logic, with no network activity or data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low). The low risk score seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward noise reduction with optional torch acceleration. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Security assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a typical spectral gating noise reduction with optional GPU acceleration. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Security assessment:** The analysis confirms no network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code's structure is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, matching the benign assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the function's structure, validating that it performs noise reduction with optional torch support. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Security assessment:** Correctly notes the absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Security assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard implementation with no security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code snippet appears clean, with no obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Malware score justification:** All reports agree on zero malware risk, which aligns with the code's functionality.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, the risk scores are appropriately low, with some reports assigning 0 or 0.1.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The code conditionally imports torch and uses it only if available and requested, which is standard.\n- No network, file, or system modifications are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are visible.\n- The code is consistent with standard audio processing practices.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, due to optional dependencies and environment checks)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured audio noise reduction utility with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code analysis.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1",
