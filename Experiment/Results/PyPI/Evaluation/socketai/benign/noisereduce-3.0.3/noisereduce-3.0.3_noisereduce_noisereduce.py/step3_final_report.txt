  "purpose": "Performs noise reduction on audio signals using spectral gating, supporting stationary, non-stationary, and GPU-accelerated methods.",
  "sources": "Input audio signal 'y', optional noise sample 'y_noise', environment variables for torch, and configuration parameters for processing.",
  "sinks": "Processed audio traces returned by sg.get_traces(), with no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input signals flow into spectral gate objects (SpectralGateStationary, SpectralGateNonStationary, or StreamedTorchGate), which process and output traces.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Dependency checks are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports dependencies, validates parameters, and instantiates appropriate spectral gating objects based on user options. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The logic is straightforward, with standard audio processing practices. No network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are evident. The code's structure and dependencies are typical for such utilities, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured audio noise reduction utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to optional dependencies and environment checks.",
