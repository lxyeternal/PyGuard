  "purpose": "The function reduces noise in audio signals using spectral gating, supporting both stationary and non-stationary noise reduction methods, with optional GPU acceleration.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: y (audio signal), sr (sample rate), y_noise (noise signal), environment variables for device selection (e.g., 'cuda').",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; function returns processed audio traces via sg.get_traces(). No data is transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input data (y, y_noise) flows into spectral gate objects (SpectralGateStationary, SpectralGateNonStationary, StreamedTorchGate), which process the data and output processed traces.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. Checks for torch availability and matching n_jobs with torch usage are appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes different spectral gating objects based on user parameters and hardware capabilities. It performs environment checks for torch, validates parameters, and constructs appropriate processing objects. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are evident. The flow is straightforward, with standard parameter validation and object creation, followed by returning processed traces. There are no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a noise reduction algorithm with options for CPU and GPU processing. It contains no signs of malicious intent or security risks. Its structure and function appear standard for audio processing libraries. Confidence in the absence of malicious behavior is high.",
