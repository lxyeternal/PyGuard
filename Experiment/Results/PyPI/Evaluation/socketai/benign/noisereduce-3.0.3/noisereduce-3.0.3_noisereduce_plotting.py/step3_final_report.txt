{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for spectrograms, noise statistics, and filtering steps in signal processing, primarily for audio or similar data analysis.",
  "sources": "Function parameters supplying signals, noise metrics, filters, and masks; no external data input or file/network reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; the code only generates plots from provided data without external output or data manipulation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into plotting functions, with no external data or untrusted input affecting system state or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, using standard libraries for visualization without obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of visualization routines for spectrograms and noise reduction metrics, accepting data as arguments and producing plots. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data transmission, or security vulnerabilities. The functions are simple, with clear intent, and rely on standard libraries. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose aligns with benign signal analysis tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward visualization utility for signal processing data. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are evident. The current assessment scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence, are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
