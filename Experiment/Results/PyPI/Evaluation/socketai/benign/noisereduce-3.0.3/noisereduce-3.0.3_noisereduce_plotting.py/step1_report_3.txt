{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting spectrograms, noise statistics, and filtering effects in signal processing, likely for audio analysis or similar applications.",
  "sources": "Data sources are external signals passed as function arguments: 'signal', 'noise_stft_db', 'mean_freq_noise', 'std_freq_noise', 'noise_thresh', 'smoothing_filter', 'sig_stft_db', 'sig_mask', 'recovered_spec'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling that could lead to security vulnerabilities; the code only performs visualization with provided data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through plotting functions, with no processing or untrusted data manipulation beyond visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code segments are present. The code consists solely of plotting routines using standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard plotting libraries and defines functions for visualizing spectrograms and noise reduction steps. There are no data manipulation, network operations, or security-sensitive functions. All data passed into functions are used solely for visualization. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments are present. The functions rely entirely on passed arguments without any external or suspicious data sources. The code appears to be straightforward visualization code for signal processing results.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for visualization purposes within a signal processing context and contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It is safe and does not perform any network or data exfiltration activities.",
