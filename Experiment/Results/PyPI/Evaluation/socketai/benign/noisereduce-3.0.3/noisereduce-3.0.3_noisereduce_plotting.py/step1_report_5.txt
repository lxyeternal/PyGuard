{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to visualize spectrograms, statistical noise analysis, and filtering steps for signal processing, likely in audio or similar data analysis contexts.",
  "sources": "The code reads input signals and statistical data passed as function arguments, such as 'signal', 'mean_freq_noise', 'std_freq_noise', 'noise_thresh', 'smoothing_filter', 'noise_stft_db', 'sig_stft_db', 'sig_mask', 'recovered_spec'.",
  "targets": "The code produces visual outputs (plots and spectrograms) but does not write data to external sources, transmit data over network, or store sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Input data (signals, statistics, filters) are visualized directly; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no external transmission or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code relies solely on standard plotting libraries for visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for plotting spectrograms and statistical analyses using matplotlib and numpy. It processes signals and statistical data passed as parameters, with no external data retrieval, network operations, or suspicious code constructs. The functions are purely visualization routines with no side effects, malicious operations, or hidden behaviors. There is no indication of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within the code. The structure and content are consistent with standard data visualization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for visualizing signal processing data. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It operates within the scope of data visualization without external data transmission or system manipulation.",
