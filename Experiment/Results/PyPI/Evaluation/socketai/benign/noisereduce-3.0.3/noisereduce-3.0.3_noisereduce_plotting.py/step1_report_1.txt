{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for visualizing audio signal processing steps, including spectrograms, noise reduction statistics, and filter applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function arguments such as 'signal', 'mean_freq_noise', 'std_freq_noise', 'noise_thresh', 'smoothing_filter', 'noise_stft_db', 'sig_stft_db', 'sig_mask', and 'recovered_spec'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data outside the local environment, nor does it interact with external systems or networks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments through plotting functions that visualize spectrograms, noise statistics, and filters, with no untrusted data manipulation or external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward visualization code with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code structures, or obfuscated logic. No unusual behavior or hidden backdoors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script provides visualization for audio signal processing, utilizing matplotlib for plotting spectrograms and statistical data. It takes input data as parameters and renders plots, with no file I/O, network communication, or data modification. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be part of an audio analysis pipeline, with clear, descriptive functions and no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign visualization tool for audio signal processing with no malicious or security risks detected. It simply plots provided data for analysis purposes.",
