  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of visualization functions for plotting spectrograms, noise statistics, filters, and processing steps.\n- All data are passed as function arguments; no file I/O, network activity, or data modification occurs.\n- The code uses standard libraries (matplotlib, numpy).\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The purpose appears to be aiding analysis of audio or signal processing data.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; describes visualization functions.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity, no external data leaks.\n- **Scores:** \n  - *malware:* 0 — justified.\n  - *securityRisk:* 0 — justified.\n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — justified.\n  - *risk:* 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above; consistent reasoning.\n- Scores are justified at zero for malware and risk.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same reasoning; no suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: all zero.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above; straightforward visualization.\n- Scores: all zero.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same reasoning; no anomalies.\n- Scores: all zero.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code behavior:** Pure visualization with no external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None apparent; the code only visualizes provided data.\n- **Malware score:** Should be 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, since code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0, no external risks identified.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:** The code is benign, purely for visualization, with no suspicious or malicious behavior, no external data handling beyond plotting, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Final note:** The scores given in all reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
