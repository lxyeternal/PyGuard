{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for plotting spectrograms, statistical data, filters, and reduction steps related to signal processing, likely in audio or similar domains.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as 'signal', 'mean_freq_noise', 'std_freq_noise', 'noise_thresh', 'smoothing_filter', 'noise_stft_db', 'sig_stft_db', 'sig_mask', and 'recovered_spec'. These are used as input for plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is directly written to external systems, files, or network connections. The code solely visualizes data in plots without executing external commands or handling untrusted inputs beyond visualization.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters to plotting functions. No transformation or untrusted data manipulation occurs that could lead to injection or leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code strictly performs visualization without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple plotting functions to visualize spectrograms, statistical noise measures, filters, and processing steps. All inputs are parameters passed into functions for visualization purposes. The functions utilize standard matplotlib features, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system manipulation. The code appears safe, straightforward, and intended for signal processing visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of visualization utilities for signal processing, with no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks. It solely generates plots based on input data. There is no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
