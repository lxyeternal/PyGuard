{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for visualizing spectrograms, noise reduction, and filtering processes in signal processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function parameters such as 'signal', 'mean_freq_noise', 'std_freq_noise', 'noise_thresh', 'smoothing_filter', 'noise_stft_db', 'sig_stft_db', 'sig_mask', and 'recovered_spec'.",
  "targets": "The code outputs plots and visualizations via matplotlib functions, which do not transmit or leak data outside the environment.",
  "flows": "Input data is provided via function parameters; the data is visualized locally with plotting functions, and no data transmission or external access occurs within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious code behavior are present. The code solely performs data visualization and processing for signal analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises visualization functions that generate plots for spectrograms and statistical noise reduction metrics. It uses standard libraries (matplotlib, numpy) for plotting. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data exfiltration routines. The data flows from function parameters to visualization outputs, with no external or hidden actions. The functions are straightforward, and no malicious or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of visualization routines for signal processing tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code fragment.",
