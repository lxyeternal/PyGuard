  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .nonstationary import SpectralGateNonStationary\nfrom .stationary import SpectralGateStationary\ntry:\n    import torch\n    TORCH_AVAILABLE = True\nexcept ImportError:\n    TORCH_AVAILABLE = False\nif TORCH_AVAILABLE:\n    from .streamed_torch_gate import StreamedTorchGate\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies that the code imports spectral gating modules and conditionally imports a Torch-based module.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data flows, no external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate. The code is a straightforward optional dependency import pattern.\n- **Scores:** All zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, correctly noting the purpose.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No data leaks or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent with the code being benign.\n- **Scores:** All zero or minimal, with a security risk of 0.1, perhaps slightly overestimating but still reasonable given the optional import pattern.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No malicious intent or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- Similar observations: correct identification of the import pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zero or minimal, consistent with benign code.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- Correctly notes the optional import pattern.\n- No data flows or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All very low, aligned with the benign assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- Also correctly describes the code's behavior.\n- No suspicious activity or data handling.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly interpret the code as a standard, benign optional dependency import pattern.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  **No.** All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all low or zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign high scores; all are appropriately low. If any were higher, that would be unjustified.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious activity—no data exfiltration, no suspicious code, no obfuscated parts. The conditional import pattern is standard for optional dependencies.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent; all assessments are cautious and accurate.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, given the code's benign nature)  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a typical pattern for optional dependencies, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minimal security risk score reflects the fact that while it’s a benign pattern, optional dependencies can sometimes introduce risks if not managed properly, but in this isolated snippet, no such issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.",
