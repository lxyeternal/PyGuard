{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports different spectral gate modules, possibly for signal processing or machine learning tasks, with conditional importing of a torch-based module if PyTorch is available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.nonstationary, .stationary, .streamed_torch_gate) and optional import of torch",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; the code does not handle user input or external data directly",
  "flows": "Conditional import flow where torch is imported only if available, enabling import of the StreamedTorchGate module",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module-level imports, including a try-except block for optional dependency handling of torch. It imports specific classes from local modules and conditionally imports a torch-based module if torch is available. There is no indication of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code's purpose seems aligned with modular import management without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import setup with conditional dependency handling. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk score is low.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
