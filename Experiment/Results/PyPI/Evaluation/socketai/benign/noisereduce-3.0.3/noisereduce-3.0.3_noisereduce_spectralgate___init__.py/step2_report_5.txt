  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their assessments against the code snippet.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .nonstationary import SpectralGateNonStationary\nfrom .stationary import SpectralGateStationary\ntry:\n    import torch\n    TORCH_AVAILABLE = True\nexcept ImportError:\n    TORCH_AVAILABLE = False\nif TORCH_AVAILABLE:\n    from .streamed_torch_gate import StreamedTorchGate\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code performs straightforward, standard conditional imports based on the presence of `torch`.\n- No user input, network communication, or data processing occurs here.\n- The imports are from local modules, and the logic is typical for optional dependencies.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the purpose and logic; no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1, appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; emphasizes the benign, standard pattern.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, which might be slightly high given the simplicity, but considering the optional dependency, it's acceptable.\n- **Malware:** 0, correct.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** No concerns. The assessment aligns well with the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Also consistent; highlights the optional import pattern.\n- **Scores:** All aligned with the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1, appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous assessments; emphasizes standard import pattern.\n- **Scores:** All consistent; no malicious implications.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, justified.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign, modular import pattern.\n- **Scores:** Consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that the code performs standard, benign conditional imports with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**  \n  No significant errors or flawed reasoning. All reports are consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is correct given no malicious activity.  \n  The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward code.  \n  The security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal risk in this import pattern.\n\n- **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**  \n  The only slight concern could be the import of `torch`, which, if malicious, could be used to execute code or exfiltrate data. However, in this context, it's a standard optional dependency with no malicious activity evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the simplicity and benign pattern, a score of around 0.1 is appropriate, reflecting minimal but present dependency considerations.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment that this code is benign, standard, and free from malicious intent. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code snippet appears safe, with no security risks beyond the normal considerations of optional dependencies.",
