{
  "purpose": "The code manages optional dependencies for spectral gating modules, importing specific classes and conditionally importing a Torch-based module if available.",
  "sources": "Local module imports and the try-except block checking for 'torch' availability.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external communication, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules based on the presence of 'torch'; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward and follows standard patterns for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard local imports and a conditional import based on the availability of 'torch'. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or suspicious code patterns. The try-except block is used solely to handle optional dependency loading. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The import pattern is common in Python packages to manage optional dependencies safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import pattern is standard, and no anomalies are present. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code does not pose any threat.",
