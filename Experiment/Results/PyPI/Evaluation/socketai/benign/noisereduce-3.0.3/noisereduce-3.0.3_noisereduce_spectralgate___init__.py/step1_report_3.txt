{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific classes from local modules related to spectral gating, and conditionally imports a torch-based module if PyTorch is available.",
  "sources": "Local module imports: .nonstationary, .stationary, and conditionally .streamed_torch_gate; the import of torch if available.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data or untrusted input handling is shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import statements do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present; conditional import pattern based on module availability is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines imports for spectral gating classes, with a conditional import of a torch-based module if torch is available. No user input, network communication, or data processing occurs. The code structure is typical for modular Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It appears to be a straightforward module import pattern for a machine learning or signal processing package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import pattern for a Python package, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
