{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific modules related to spectral gating, potentially for signal processing or data analysis, and conditionally imports a torch-based module if PyTorch is available.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.nonstationary, .stationary, .streamed_torch_gate), and environment check for torch availability.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data leak points are present; no external data or untrusted sources are used.",
  "flows": "Imports depend on the availability of the torch library, but there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of a torch-dependent module is normal; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports modules based on the presence of the torch library, which is a common pattern for optional dependencies. It does not execute any untrusted code or perform any network or file operations. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The code is simple, clear, and follows standard Python practices for optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages local module imports based on environment capabilities without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
