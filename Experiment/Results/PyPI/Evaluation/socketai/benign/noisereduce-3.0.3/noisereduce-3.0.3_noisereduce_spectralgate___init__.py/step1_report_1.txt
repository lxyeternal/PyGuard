{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to spectral gating, likely for audio or signal processing, and conditionally imports a Torch-based module if PyTorch is available.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current package directory to import specific classes, and attempts to import the 'torch' library, which could be considered untrusted input in certain contexts.",
  "sinks": "The imported classes and modules are used within the package; no untrusted data is written or transmitted; the code does not appear to send data over a network or write to external files.",
  "flows": "The flow involves attempting to import 'torch', then conditionally importing a Torch-specific module if successful. No untrusted data flows from source to sink; the flow is limited to module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The import logic is standard, with a conditional import based on library availability.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward module imports, with a try-except block to handle optional dependency on 'torch'. No user input, untrusted data, or external communications are involved. The structure is typical for optional dependencies. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are evident. The only dynamic aspect is the conditional import, which is common in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import mechanism for spectral gating modules, with a conditional import of a Torch-based module if available. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected.",
