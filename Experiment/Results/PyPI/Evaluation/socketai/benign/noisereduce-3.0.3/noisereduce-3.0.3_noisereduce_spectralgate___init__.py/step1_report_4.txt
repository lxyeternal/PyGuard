{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific modules related to spectral gating, with optional import of a torch-based module if PyTorch is available.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module files (.nonstationary, .stationary, .streamed_torch_gate) and the environment when attempting to import torch.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; no data output, network connections, or sensitive data handling occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports originate from local modules, with optional import of torch-dependent module if available. No data flows from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports modules based on the availability of the torch library, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are observed. The optional import pattern is typical for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import internal modules for spectral gating functions. It conditionally imports an additional module if PyTorch is installed, setting a flag accordingly. There are no data processing, user inputs, or network activities. The import logic appears standard and benign, with no suspicious or malicious behavior or obfuscation. The structure and purpose are straightforward, focusing on module imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import setup with optional dependency handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and typical for a Python package supporting optional dependencies.",
