  "sinks": "np.fft.ifft output (real part of inverse FFT)",
  "flows": "Frequency mask creation -> apply random phases -> inverse FFT to reconstruct noise signal",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for creating band-limited noise via FFT, applying random phases to positive frequencies, and reconstructing the signal. It uses standard numpy functions with no external data, network activity, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and consistent with typical signal processing utilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is scientific and benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for generating band-limited noise signals. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The overall assessment is that the code is safe and should be considered non-malicious.",
