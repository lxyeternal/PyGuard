{
  "purpose": "The code generates band-limited noise using FFT and inverse FFT, primarily for signal processing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it solely relies on function parameters and internal calculations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that send data outside the program or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The data flows from input parameters through frequency calculations, phase randomization, and inverse FFT to produce noise.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. Usage of random number generation is standard for noise synthesis.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate frequency domain noise with specific bandwidth limitations. It uses numpy for array operations, FFT, and IFFT. No external data or network interactions are involved. The random phases are generated in a typical manner for noise synthesis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code's logic is straightforward, well-structured, and intended for signal processing without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for generating band-limited noise with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard computational tasks related to signal processing without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
