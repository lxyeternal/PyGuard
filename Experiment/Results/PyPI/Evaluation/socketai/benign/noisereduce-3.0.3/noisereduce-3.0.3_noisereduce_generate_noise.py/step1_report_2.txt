{
  "purpose": "Generate band-limited noise using FFT-based methods.",
  "sources": "The function band_limited_noise reads input parameters (min_freq, max_freq, samples, samplerate) to generate noise within a specified frequency band.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that send data externally or perform insecure actions; it only processes data internally for noise generation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the creation of the frequency domain array 'f', which is then transformed into time domain noise via fftnoise.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and documented.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate noise within a specific frequency band using FFT. It initializes frequency domain data, applies random phases, and reconstructs the signal via inverse FFT. No external data sources, network connections, or hidden behaviors are evident. The implementation is standard and intended for signal processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for generating band-limited noise. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign utility function for signal processing.",
