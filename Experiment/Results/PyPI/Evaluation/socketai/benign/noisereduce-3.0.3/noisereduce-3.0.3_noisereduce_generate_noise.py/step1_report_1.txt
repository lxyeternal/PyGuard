{
  "purpose": "The code generates band-limited noise signals using Fourier transforms, likely for signal processing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as min_freq, max_freq, samples, and samplerate to the function band_limited_noise, and internal random number generation within fftnoise.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data is transmitted or stored externally; no network activity, file writing, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate frequency masks, which are then modified with random phases in fftnoise to produce noise signals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code uses standard numpy functions for FFT and random phase generation, typical for signal processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate band-limited noise by creating a frequency domain mask and applying random phase shifts, then transforming back to time domain. All operations are standard numerical procedures with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive information handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of band-limited noise generation for signal processing purposes. No suspicious or malicious activity identified. It is a straightforward, standard implementation with no security risks or malware indications.",
