{
  "purpose": "Generate band-limited noise signals using FFT and inverse FFT methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: min_freq, max_freq, samples, samplerate; internally, numpy functions for array creation, FFT, and random phase generation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data over the network, write to files, or access sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "Input parameters define frequency range and sampling; fftnoise applies random phase to frequency components; band_limited_noise constructs frequency mask and generates noise.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Uses standard numpy functions for signal processing.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard method for generating band-limited noise signals by manipulating frequency components and applying inverse FFT. It relies on numpy's FFT and random number generation, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. There are no embedded data leaks, network operations, or malicious side effects. The structure is clear, and the functions serve legitimate signal processing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation for generating band-limited noise signals. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware is present. It uses standard libraries and techniques without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
