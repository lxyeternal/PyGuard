{
  "purpose": "Generate band-limited noise using Fourier transforms, potentially for signal processing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters (min_freq, max_freq, samples, samplerate) and creates frequency domain data based on these inputs.",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks or untrusted data flows are apparent. No external data outputs or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the creation of frequency array 'f' and the subsequent FFT noise generation; these do not lead to any external or sensitive data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and appears solely for signal noise generation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy for numerical operations and defines functions for generating frequency-limited noise via FFT. It uses random phases to produce noise within specified frequency bounds. There are no external inputs beyond function parameters, and no outputs or side effects indicating malicious activity. The implementation aligns with typical scientific computing tasks. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of signal noise generation with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. It serves a technical purpose related to signal processing and does not pose security risks.",
