  "purpose": "Implementation of spectral gating for noise reduction/enhancement in audio signals.",
  "sources": "Reads waveform data 'y', parameters for spectral processing, temporary files for parallel chunk processing.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or exfiltration; uses temporary files locally.",
  "flows": "Reads waveform -> generates chunks with padding -> applies filtering in parallel -> writes to temp files -> retrieves processed data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, external communication, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spectral gating with chunked parallel processing, using temporary files for efficiency. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies on common libraries. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The use of temp files and parallelization is typical for large data processing tasks. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate spectral gating implementation for audio processing, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
