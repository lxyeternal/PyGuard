{
  "purpose": "The code implements a spectral gating noise reduction algorithm for audio processing, specifically designed to denoise audio chunks based on stationary noise estimates.",
  "sources": "Reads audio data (`y`, `y_noise`) during initialization and chunk input for denoising.",
  "sinks": "Processes audio chunks for denoising; no explicit data leaks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Audio data is read during initialization and passed into the spectral_gating_stationary method, which applies masking based on noise thresholds and returns the denoised audio chunk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections. No obfuscated code or unusual data manipulations. Use of standard libraries (numpy, scipy) with common audio processing functions. No hidden or misleading code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a noise reduction class with parameters and noise data, computes noise statistics via STFT, and applies spectral gating to denoise audio chunks. It uses standard signal processing techniques with no suspicious behaviors. There are no external network connections, no code injection, and no use of environment variables or sensitive data. All functions and variables appear consistent with intended audio processing functionality. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, hidden functionalities, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of spectral gating noise reduction for audio processing. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The design relies solely on established libraries and methods, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
