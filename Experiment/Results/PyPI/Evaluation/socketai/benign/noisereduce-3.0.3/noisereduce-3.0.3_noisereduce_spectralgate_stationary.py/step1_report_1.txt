{
  "purpose": "This code implements a spectral gating noise reduction algorithm for audio signals, specifically a stationary noise suppression method.",
  "sources": "Reads input audio data 'y', 'y_noise', and various configuration parameters. Loads noise profile during initialization, including computations over noise STFT.",
  "sinks": "Processes input chunks to produce denoised audio data; no data is sent to external systems or networks within this code.",
  "flows": "Noise profile is computed from 'y_noise' during initialization. During processing, audio chunks are transformed via STFT, masked based on thresholds, then inverse transformed to produce denoised output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Use of standard signal processing libraries. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input audio data and noise data to compute spectral thresholds. It applies spectral gating in the 'spectral_gating_stationary' method, masking frequencies above the noise threshold, optionally smoothing the mask. It uses standard libraries like numpy, scipy, and noisereduce, with no external network calls or hidden behaviors. No suspicious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a noise reduction technique based on spectral gating. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It relies on standard libraries and normal signal processing methods. Therefore, it presents low security risk.",
