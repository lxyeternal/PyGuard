{
  "purpose": "The code implements spectral gating for noise reduction in audio signals, utilizing noise profile estimation and spectral masking techniques to denoise input chunks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input audio data during initialization (y, y_noise), and computes noise statistics from the noise profile; it also reads audio chunks during processing in spectral_gating_stationary.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems or files; it processes data internally and returns denoised audio chunks. No external data sinks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Noise profile data (y_noise) is used to compute noise thresholds; input chunks are transformed via STFT, masked based on thresholds, and inverse transformed to produce denoised output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity are detected. The code uses standard libraries and techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spectral gating noise reduction: it initializes noise statistics from provided noise data, applies spectral masking based on noise thresholds, optionally smooths masks, and reconstructs denoised audio. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code relies solely on well-known scientific libraries and standard signal processing methods, with no external network activity or data leaks. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero, and the low security risk score reflects the benign nature of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of spectral gating noise reduction with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. It operates solely within expected parameters, and the security risk is minimal. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
