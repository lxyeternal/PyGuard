  "purpose": "Implement spectral gating for noise reduction in audio signals, utilizing STFT, masking, and inverse STFT techniques.",
  "sources": "Reads audio chunks, performs STFT analysis, and applies masking functions internally; no external data sources or network inputs.",
  "sinks": "Processes data in-memory; no external data leaks, network activity, or credential handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input audio chunks -> STFT analysis -> masking and smoothing -> inverse STFT -> output denoised audio.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spectral gating for audio denoising, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It relies on common scientific libraries and applies typical signal processing techniques. No external data leaks, network activity, or credential handling are present. The masking, smoothing, and inverse transform processes are implemented as expected for such algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a legitimate implementation of spectral gating for noise reduction, with no malicious or obfuscated components. It is safe for use, and the security risk is minimal.",
