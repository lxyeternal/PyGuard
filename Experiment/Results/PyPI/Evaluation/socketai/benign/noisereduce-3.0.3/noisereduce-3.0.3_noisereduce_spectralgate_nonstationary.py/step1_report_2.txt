{
  "purpose": "The code implements a non-stationary spectral gating denoising algorithm for audio signals, using techniques like STFT, sigmoid masking, and smoothing filters.",
  "sources": "Inputs include audio chunks (chunk), parameters for windowing and filtering, and class attributes. No external untrusted data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are explicitly present, such as network transmissions or file writes. The code processes in-memory data only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input chunks through spectral analysis, masking, filtering, and inverse STFT to produce denoised audio output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are observed. Usage of standard scientific libraries and functions without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs spectral denoising by computing the STFT of audio chunks, applying a sigmoid-based mask that emphasizes non-stationary noise components, smoothing the mask with convolution, and reconstructing the signal with ISTFT. All functions and methods utilize standard scientific computing libraries (numpy, scipy) with typical signal processing procedures. No network activity, hidden code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a spectral gating denoising technique without any signs of malicious intent or malware. It relies on common scientific libraries and processes data in-memory. No security risks or malicious behaviors are evident.",
