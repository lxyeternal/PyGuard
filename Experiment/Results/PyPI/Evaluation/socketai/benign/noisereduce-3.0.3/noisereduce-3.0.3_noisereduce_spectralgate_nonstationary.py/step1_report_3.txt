{
  "purpose": "The code implements a spectral gating noise reduction algorithm, specifically for non-stationary noise, to denoise audio signals by applying adaptive spectral masks and inverse STFT.",
  "sources": "Reads audio chunks (input parameter 'chunk'), audio signal 'y' during initialization, and audio sampling rate 'sr'.",
  "sinks": "Processes audio data within the 'spectral_gating_nonstationary' method; no evident data leak or untrusted data sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Audio input 'chunk' is transformed into STFT, processed with smoothed spectral representations, masked, and then reconstructed into denoised audio output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of standard signal processing libraries and functions. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs spectral analysis and filtering using standard libraries (numpy, scipy). It calculates smoothed spectral representations, applies sigmoid-based masking, and reconstructs audio signals. All operations are consistent with typical noise reduction procedures. There are no signs of malicious data handling or hidden functionalities. The code uses public libraries and straightforward algorithms, with no indications of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of non-stationary spectral gating noise reduction, with no suspicious or malicious elements. It processes audio signals securely and transparently without evident security risks or malware indicators.",
