{
  "purpose": "The code implements a non-stationary spectral gating algorithm for denoising audio signals, specifically designed for spectral noise suppression using STFT transformations and smoothing filters.",
  "sources": "Input audio chunks, environmental variables, and internal parameters for signal processing; notably 'chunk' parameter in spectral_gating_nonstationary method.",
  "sinks": "Denoised audio output returned as numpy arrays; no external data sinks or network communications present.",
  "flows": "Input audio -> STFT transformation -> spectral smoothing -> masking via sigmoid -> masking applied to STFT -> inverse STFT -> output denoised audio.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. The use of standard scientific libraries and typical signal processing functions appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spectral gating for denoising with established libraries such as numpy, scipy.signal, and noisereduce. It calculates smoothed spectral representations, applies sigmoid-based masking, and performs inverse STFT to reconstruct signals. No unusual or malicious logic, no suspicious external communications, and no hidden code or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of spectral gating for audio noise reduction. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs signal processing tasks with no external communication, credential handling, or covert actions.",
