  "purpose": "Implement spectral gating for noise reduction in audio signals, including non-stationary noise handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input audio data (parameter y), configuration parameters, and data from get_time_smoothed_representation function.",
  "sinks": "Processes data within signal processing functions; no data is sent over network or written to disk explicitly.",
  "flows": "Input audio data -> spectral_gating_nonstationary method -> signal processing functions (stft, istft, convolution) -> output denoised audio.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious external connections; no obfuscated code; no unusual or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spectral gating noise reduction, utilizing common signal processing techniques with no signs of malicious behavior. It imports standard libraries (numpy, scipy) and defines functions for signal smoothing and spectral gating. The processing flow is typical for noise suppression tasks, involving Fourier transforms, masking, and inverse transforms. No network communications, file manipulations, or secret handling are present. The code structure appears normal for an audio processing library module.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a typical implementation of spectral gating for noise reduction with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It uses standard techniques and libraries for signal processing, and there are no suspicious operations or hidden functionalities.",
