  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - The code is a minimal template for SDK customization, containing licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty `__all__` list, and a single function `patch_sdk` with only a docstring.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external connections, or data processing.\n   - No obfuscated code, hidden payloads, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard boilerplate, and intended for future customization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a harmless template with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident in the summaries or conclusions.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary; the scores align well with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments indicate no malicious activity or security risk, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n   - The code is purely structural, with no operational logic that could pose a threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on factual analysis; no speculative vulnerabilities are suggested.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for SDK customization.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n   - No discrepancies or inconsistencies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Reasoning:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the comprehensive analysis in the reports, the overall security posture is benign. The code is a boilerplate template with no operational or malicious concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately. No further action or concern is warranted.",
