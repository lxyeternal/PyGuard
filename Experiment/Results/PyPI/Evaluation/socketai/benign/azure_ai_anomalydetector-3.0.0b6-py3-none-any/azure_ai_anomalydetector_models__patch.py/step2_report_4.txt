  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - The code is a minimal template with licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty `__all__` list, and a single function `patch_sdk()` that contains only documentation and no executable code.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network connections, or external data handling.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or payloads are present.\n   - The structure and comments suggest it is intended as a placeholder or extension point for SDK customization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly identify the code as benign, standard boilerplate, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, sources, anomalies, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since there's no evidence of security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Justification:**\n   - The code is a harmless template for SDK customization, with no execution, data handling, or external communication.\n   - The function `patch_sdk()` is only documented and contains no code, serving as a placeholder.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not process or transmit data.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Final Assessment:**\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n   - The scores reflect the actual risk, malware, and obfuscation levels accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign SDK template with no security concerns. No further action is needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a harmless, minimal placeholder for SDK customization, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
