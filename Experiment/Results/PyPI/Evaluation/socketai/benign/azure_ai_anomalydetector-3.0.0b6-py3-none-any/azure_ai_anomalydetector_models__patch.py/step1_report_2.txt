  "purpose": "This code serves as a template or placeholder for customizing SDK generated code, providing an entry point for patching or modifying the SDK behavior.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present; the code imports standard typing and defines an empty list and a function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code is purely structural and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a boilerplate template with licensing and a customization function. No unusual or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, structured template with a licensing comment, a docstring, an import statement, a variable declaration, and a function definition. It lacks any data input, processing, or external communication. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are visible. The purpose is to provide hooks for future customizations, as indicated by comments and docstrings.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for SDK customization with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is intended for user modifications and does not perform any harmful operations.",
