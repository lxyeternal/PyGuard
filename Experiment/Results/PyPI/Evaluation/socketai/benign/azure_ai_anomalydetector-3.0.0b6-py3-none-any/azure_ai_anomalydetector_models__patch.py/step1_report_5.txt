{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a template or placeholder for customizing generated SDK code, specifically for the Azure SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or output points, and no untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright notice, an empty list for exports, and a placeholder function with no operational code. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present. The comments refer to customization procedures but do not include any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and serves as a template or scaffold for SDK customization. It defines an empty __all__ list, which controls the public API, and a function 'patch_sdk' intended for future modifications. The code does not execute any external commands, handle untrusted data, or perform operations that could be malicious. It is a standard, benign pattern used in SDK generation or customization workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign template for SDK customization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger, safe SDK codebase intended for user modifications.",
