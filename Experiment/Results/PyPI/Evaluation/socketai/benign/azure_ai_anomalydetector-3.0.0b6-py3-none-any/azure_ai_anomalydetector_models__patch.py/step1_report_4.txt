  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated code, specifically for the Azure SDK, allowing users to modify or extend functionality via the 'patch_sdk' function.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data inputs; static code only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no operations involving untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code is purely boilerplate with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains minimal implementation, with an empty list for public objects and an empty function for patching; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal template intended for customization, including licensing and copyright comments, imports, and a placeholder function. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or contain any suspicious logic. The structure is typical for SDK customization points, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for SDK customization with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is intended as a placeholder for future modifications, and nothing suspicious or harmful is present.",
