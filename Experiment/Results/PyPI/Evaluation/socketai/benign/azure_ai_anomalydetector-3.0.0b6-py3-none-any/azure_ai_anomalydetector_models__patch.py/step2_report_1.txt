  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- The code contains licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty `__all__` list, and a single function `patch_sdk()` with only documentation and no executable code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The purpose is to provide hooks for future modifications, not to perform any operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious content.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or structural issues:**  \n  None. The code is a straightforward template.  \n- **Potential concerns:**  \n  None identified. It’s intentionally minimal.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign `0`, which is correct.  \n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All assign `0`, which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The code does not process data, communicate externally, or execute any logic that could be malicious.\n- It’s a standard placeholder/template with no embedded payloads or obfuscation.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as a benign SDK template, not a malicious artifact.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is purely structural.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code’s content and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports’ conclusions. The code is a harmless, standard SDK customization scaffold.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThese reflect the benign, boilerplate nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe SDK customization template with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
