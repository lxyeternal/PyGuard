  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n- It includes licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty `__all__` list, and a single function `patch_sdk()` which contains only documentation and no operational logic.\n- There are no external inputs, data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code appears as a standard placeholder for future customization, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It is straightforward, well-structured boilerplate.\n- **Malicious code:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation present.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n- **Data flows / sinks / sources:** None, as the code does not process or transmit data.\n\n### Review of the reports:\nAll five reports agree that:\n- The code is a benign, minimal SDK template.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is present.\n- No data input/output, external communication, or obfuscation.\n- The purpose is to serve as a placeholder for user modifications.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports — consistent and justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 in all reports — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 in all reports — justified given the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is standard boilerplate with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities that are not evident.\n- The scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a benign SDK customization template with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, just as a precaution, but effectively zero)\n\n**Justification:** The code is a standard, harmless template with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- The reports are accurate.\n- No further action needed.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or additional insights.",
