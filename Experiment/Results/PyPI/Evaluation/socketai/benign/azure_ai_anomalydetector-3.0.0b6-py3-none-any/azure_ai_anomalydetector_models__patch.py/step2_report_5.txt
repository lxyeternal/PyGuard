  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Structure**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n   - The code includes licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty `__all__` list, and a single function `patch_sdk()` with only documentation and no operational logic.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or data processing.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious code constructs, or payloads are detected.\n   - The code is standard for SDK customization points, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, boilerplate, and intended for future customization.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the analysis.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's harmless nature.\n\n5. **Claims about Potential Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the code's purpose as a placeholder/template.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made beyond the scope of the code's content.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate** after reviewing all reports and analyzing the code:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 — the code is purely boilerplate with no malicious payload.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk**: 0 — the code is a benign template with no security risks.\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues in this code snippet.",
