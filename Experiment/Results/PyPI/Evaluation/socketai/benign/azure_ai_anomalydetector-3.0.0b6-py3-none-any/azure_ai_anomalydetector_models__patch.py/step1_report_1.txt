{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, specifically for Azure SDK customization in Python.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data read operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No data output, external connections, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present as the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears as a standard, minimal template with no obfuscated elements or suspicious code. The only function is a placeholder for SDK patching, with no payload or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty __all__ list, and a single function definition for 'patch_sdk' which contains only documentation and a docstring. No external input, data processing, or network activity is present. The structure is typical for a customizable SDK template. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign SDK customization template with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears as standard boilerplate code intended for future modifications.",
