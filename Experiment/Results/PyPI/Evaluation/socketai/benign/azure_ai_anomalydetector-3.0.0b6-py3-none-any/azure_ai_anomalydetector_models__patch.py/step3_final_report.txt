{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a template for customizing SDK behavior, providing hooks for user modifications without executing any logic by default.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only through external code that might invoke 'patch_sdk()' in the future; currently, there are no active data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present as the function contains only documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with licensing comments, a module docstring, an import, an empty __all__, and a placeholder function.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign SDK customization scaffold with no external data handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs. It contains no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as a safe, boilerplate template. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, standard SDK extension point with no malicious or security concerns. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
