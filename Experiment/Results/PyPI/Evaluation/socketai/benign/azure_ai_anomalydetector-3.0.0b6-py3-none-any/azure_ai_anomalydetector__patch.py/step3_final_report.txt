  "purpose": "Template for SDK customization, serving as a placeholder for user modifications.",
  "sources": "No data sources, external inputs, or data handling present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network calls, or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static placeholder code.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard comments, import, empty list, and empty function.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign SDK customization template with no operational logic, data processing, or suspicious patterns. It contains only comments, an import statement, an empty list, and a placeholder function intended for user modifications. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The code's purpose is purely structural, facilitating customization without executing any logic or handling data. The absence of external data sources, network activity, or code execution points to a safe, standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK customization template with no malicious or suspicious elements. All signals indicate a safe, non-malicious placeholder. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0, with high confidence.",
