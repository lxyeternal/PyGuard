{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, specifically for Microsoft Azure SDKs, with no operational logic beyond an empty function and licensing info.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; only metadata and an empty function are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data processing occurring.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code only defines a function with no execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only boilerplate comments, license info, import statements, and an empty function, with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard template for SDK customization with no operational logic, data handling, or dynamic code execution. It does not contain any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The absence of dynamic features or external input processing suggests a very low risk profile. The licensing and comments are standard, and the empty function is for user customization, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder for SDK customizations with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
