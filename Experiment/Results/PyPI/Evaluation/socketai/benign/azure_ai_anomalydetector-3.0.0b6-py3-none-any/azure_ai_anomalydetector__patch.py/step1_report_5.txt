{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated code, specifically for a Python SDK, allowing user-defined modifications via the `patch_sdk` function.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reads; the code contains only a function definition and comments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that could leak data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely structural and documentation without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing comments, a docstring explaining customization, an import statement, a definition of an empty list `__all__`, and a single function `patch_sdk` that contains only documentation comments. There are no data processing, external inputs, or system calls. The function is meant for user customization and does not execute any logic on its own. The code appears to be a standard, benign template for SDK customization without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless template intended for SDK customization. It contains no malicious intent, no malicious code, and no security risks. It simply provides a placeholder for user modifications with no apparent security concerns.",
