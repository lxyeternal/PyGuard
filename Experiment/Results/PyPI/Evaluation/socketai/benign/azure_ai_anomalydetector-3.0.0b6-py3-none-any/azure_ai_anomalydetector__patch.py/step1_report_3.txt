{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a template or stub for customizing an SDK generated by a code generator, specifically for Azure SDK for Python. It provides a placeholder for user modifications without implementing actual functionality.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading functions are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or outputs that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code does not perform any processing or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, mainly containing comments, type hints, and a placeholder function. There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic template with a function intended for SDK customization. It imports typing for type annotations, defines an empty list for exports, and includes a placeholder function 'patch_sdk' for future customizations. The code contains no data processing, external data sources, or executable logic that could be malicious. Its purpose is to serve as a customization hook for SDK developers, not to perform any operations itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, intentionally minimal template for SDK customization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data handling, network operations, or sensitive processing.",
