  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the code's security implications step-by-step.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The provided code is a minimal template for SDK customization, consisting solely of comments, an import statement, an empty list `__all__`, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk`.\n- There are no data inputs, external data sources, data sinks, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- The function `patch_sdk` is intended for user customization, with no internal logic or operations.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Issue 1:\n- **Purpose:** Benign SDK customization template.\n- **Source:** No external data.\n- **Sink:** None.\n- **Flow:** None.\n- **Anomalies:** Only boilerplate comments and an empty function.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard placeholder with no malicious activity.\n\n**Risk & Malware Score:**  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n\n---\n\n### Issue 2:\n- Similar to Issue 1, with identical characteristics.  \n- **Risk & Malware Score:**  \n  - **Risk:** 0  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n\n---\n\n### Issue 3:\n- Again, the same minimal template with no operational logic.  \n- **Risk & Malware Score:**  \n  - **Risk:** 0  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n\n---\n\n### Issue 4:\n- Same as above; a benign placeholder for SDK customization.  \n- **Risk & Malware Score:**  \n  - **Risk:** 0  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n\n---\n\n### Issue 5:\n- Consistent with previous reports; a standard, harmless template.  \n- **Risk & Malware Score:**  \n  - **Risk:** 0  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description—boilerplate SDK customization template with no operational or malicious logic.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as there's no data processing, external input, or code execution.\n- **Malware suspicion:** None; the code does not exhibit any malicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in each report are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The overall malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at **0**.\n- The security risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard SDK customization template with no security concerns.",
