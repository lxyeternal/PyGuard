  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their findings, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization, containing only comments, import statements, an empty list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()`.\n- No external data sources, data sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is detected.\n- The code's purpose is clearly to serve as a customization hook, not to perform any operational logic.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Confirms the code is benign, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully reasonable. The code is just a template with no operational or malicious logic.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, confirms benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion—benign, minimal template.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates the benign, placeholder nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as others; harmless template.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Critical Evaluation\n\n- All reports assign **malware=0** and **obfuscated=0**, which is correct given the code.\n- The **securityRisk=0** is justified because there's no operational logic, no external inputs, no network calls, and no data handling.\n- The **confidence=1** (or 1.0) across all reports aligns with the clear, minimal, and benign nature of the code.\n- The **scores** are consistent and reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations\n\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0, code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Correctly 0, as the code poses no security threat.\n- **Confidence:** Fully justified at 1, given the clear benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Estimate**\n\n**Based on the analysis, the current scores are accurate and justified.** The code is a standard SDK customization template with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the existing assessments, confirming that the code is safe and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent, accurate, and reflect the benign nature of the code. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
