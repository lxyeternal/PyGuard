  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a minimal template for SDK customization, containing only comments, an import, an empty list, and a placeholder function.\n- No external data sources, no data processing, no network calls, no input/output operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior.\n- The purpose is clearly to serve as a customization hook, not to perform any operational logic.\n- All reports agree on benignity, with confidence scores of 1 and zero malware, obfuscated, or security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any operational logic, data handling, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign boilerplate.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** No logical errors or flaws are present; the code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** No claims of vulnerabilities are made, and none are implied by the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1, as the analysis is straightforward and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a standard SDK customization template with no security issues.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are unjustified; the analysis is cautious and correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, minimal, and standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a boilerplate SDK customization template with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**If you have any other reports or need further analysis, please let me know.**",
