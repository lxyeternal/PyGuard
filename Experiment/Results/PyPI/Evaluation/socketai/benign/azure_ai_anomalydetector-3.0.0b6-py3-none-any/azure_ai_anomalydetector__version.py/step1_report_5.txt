  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments, licensing info, and a version string assignment. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The code appears to be part of a generated package's metadata. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The version string is a standard string declaration without any manipulative or suspicious content.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a benign, metadata-related snippet typical for Python packages. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
