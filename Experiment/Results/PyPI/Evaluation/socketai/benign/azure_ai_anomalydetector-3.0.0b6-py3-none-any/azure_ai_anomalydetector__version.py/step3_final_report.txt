{
  "purpose": "Metadata declaration of package version, auto-generated by Microsoft code generator.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of VERSION variable; comments indicating licensing and auto-generation.",
  "sinks": "None; no input/output, external data, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and contains only comments and a variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a single assignment of a version string. There are no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious constructs. The code is clearly auto-generated and serves as metadata. All signals point to benign, non-malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, thorough, and require no modifications.",
  "confidence": 1,
