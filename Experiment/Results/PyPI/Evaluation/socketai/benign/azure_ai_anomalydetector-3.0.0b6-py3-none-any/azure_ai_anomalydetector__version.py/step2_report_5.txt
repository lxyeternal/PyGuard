  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe a very simple code snippet: a comment header, a license notice, and a single assignment of a version string (`VERSION = \"3.0.0b6\"`).\n   - There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no data processing.\n   - The code is clearly auto-generated, as indicated by comments, and contains no suspicious or malicious logic.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - Confirmed: The code is benign, serving as metadata or version declaration.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or hidden code are present.\n\n3. **Scores & Their Reasonableness:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; there's no indication of malicious intent.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`. The code contains no security vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n4. **Analysis of Each Report:**\n   - All reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no security issues.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The reasoning is sound; no assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n\n5. **Potential Adjustments:**\n   - Since all reports are uniform and accurate, no score adjustments are necessary.\n   - The scores reflect the actual risk profile accurately.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is purely metadata, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n   - The confidence should stay at 1, given the clarity and simplicity.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports' findings and the code's content. No further action or concern is warranted.",
