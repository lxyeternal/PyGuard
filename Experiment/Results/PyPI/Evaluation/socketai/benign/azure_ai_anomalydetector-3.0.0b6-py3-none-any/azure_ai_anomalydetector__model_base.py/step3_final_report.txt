  "purpose": "Utility module for serialization and deserialization of models, datetime, bytes, timedelta, and related data types within SDKs like Azure SDKs.",
  "sources": "Reads data from model attributes, input arguments, and external data sources via sys.modules for dynamic model lookup.",
  "sinks": "Serializes data for JSON output; deserializes ISO date/time strings into Python objects; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source: input data or model attributes -> processing functions (serialization/deserialization) -> output JSON or Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.modules for dynamic model resolution; reflection patterns are standard in SDKs, no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides serialization/deserialization utilities, handling datetime, bytes, timedelta, and models. It employs standard libraries and reflection techniques common in SDKs. No network, file, or credential handling is present. The use of sys.modules for dynamic model lookup is typical in such frameworks. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose, and does not contain suspicious patterns or external data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility module for data handling within SDKs. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
