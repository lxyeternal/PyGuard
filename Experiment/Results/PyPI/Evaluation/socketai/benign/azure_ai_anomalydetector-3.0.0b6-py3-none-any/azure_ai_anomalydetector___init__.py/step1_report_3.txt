{
  "purpose": "This code is part of a SDK module generated by Microsoft for anomaly detection, primarily for importing dependencies and setting up the module namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_client, _version, _patch). No external input reading or data input points present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import pattern with wildcard import and conditional import handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and sets up the namespace for the SDK. It conditionally imports a patch module, which could be for optional patching or customization. The use of wildcard import and conditional import pattern is common in SDK setup code. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. No obfuscation, external data handling, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, generated SDK setup file with no malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily handles module imports and namespace setup. No malware or security issues are detected.",
