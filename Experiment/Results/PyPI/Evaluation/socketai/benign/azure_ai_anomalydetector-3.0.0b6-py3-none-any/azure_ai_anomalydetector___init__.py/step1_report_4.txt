{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a generated SDK for an Anomaly Detector service, primarily importing modules and setting up package exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_client, _version, _patch) and the version variable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and then calls _patch_sdk(), which could execute code from imported modules, but there is no indication of untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*), which can sometimes obscure the actual imported functions or variables, but here it is controlled and limited. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily boilerplate for setting up a Python package, importing necessary components, and handling optional patch imports. The wildcard import is potentially risky but appears to be part of generated code for flexibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code adheres to standard practices for SDK setup, with licensing and copyright notices. The only minor concern is the wildcard import, but given the context, it seems intentional and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, generated SDK initialization code with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The use of wildcard import is typical in generated code and does not pose a significant threat in this context.",
