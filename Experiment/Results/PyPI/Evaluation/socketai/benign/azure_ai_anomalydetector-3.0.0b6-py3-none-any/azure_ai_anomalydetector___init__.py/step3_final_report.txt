  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Importing modules, setting version, applying patches, defining __all__, calling _patch_sdk().",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from _patch, which could be risky if _patch is compromised, but standard in SDKs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated SDK setup script with standard imports, version setting, optional patch import with fallback, and a call to _patch_sdk(). No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The wildcard import from _patch is typical in SDKs but could pose a risk if _patch is malicious, though unlikely in a controlled environment. The code is straightforward, well-commented, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious intent. The risk associated with the wildcard import is minimal in a trusted environment. Scores reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.",
