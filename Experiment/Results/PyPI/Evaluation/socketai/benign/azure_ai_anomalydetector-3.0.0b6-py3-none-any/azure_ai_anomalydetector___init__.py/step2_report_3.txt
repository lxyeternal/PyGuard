  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard SDK initializer with no malicious activity, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious patterns, no external network or data operations.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with a note on the wildcard import from `_patch`. While this could be risky if `_patch` is compromised, in a controlled SDK environment, this is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — seems reasonable given the cautious note.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, but the wildcard import warrants a slight risk score.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates the standard SDK setup, with emphasis on the wildcard import pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity; the minor risk is due to import pattern.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; standard SDK initialization with controlled use of wildcard import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, with no signs of malicious activity. Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) perhaps due to the wildcard import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely for SDK setup.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, generated SDK code, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (0.1-0.2) due to the wildcard import pattern, which in SDKs is common but could theoretically be exploited if `_patch` were compromised. However, given the context, this is a standard pattern.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and generated.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering the wildcard import, but it's a controlled pattern in SDKs.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard SDK setup, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor risk score reflects the import pattern but does not indicate a real threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive assessment.",
