{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a generated SDK module for the Microsoft Anomaly Detector service, setting up imports, versioning, and patching mechanisms.",
  "sources": "The code reads from internal modules (_client, _version, _patch) and the imported __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks related to untrusted data or external output, such as network operations, file writes, or command execution.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing internal modules, setting version information, and applying patches, which are all internal setup steps without handling untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The wildcard import of _patch and the conditional import with fallback are standard for generated SDK code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK setup with generated code comments, imports of internal modules, version setting, and patch application. It uses a try-except for importing optional patches. There are no indications of malicious payloads, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. All activities are typical for SDK initializations and module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign SDK module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up the SDK environment and applies optional patches, all within expected patterns.",
