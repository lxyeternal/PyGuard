{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and imports components for an Anomaly Detector SDK, setting up versioning, patching, and client access.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_client, _version, _patch), and the assignment of __version__ and __all__.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations such as network calls, data leaks, or command execution.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, setting version info, conditionally importing patches, and extending the __all__ list before invoking _patch_sdk().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements are present. The wildcard import of _patch could be a concern if malicious, but it appears controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly boilerplate for module setup: importing internal components, handling optional patches, and setting public API exports. The use of try-except for optional imports is standard practice. No external data is read, and no data is transmitted or processed in a suspicious manner. The wildcard import from _patch may be a concern if _patch contains malicious code, but there's no evidence here. The code does not perform any network operations, execute untrusted input, or handle sensitive data. Overall, it appears to be a standard SDK initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard SDK setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of wildcard import is controlled within the package. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.",
