{
  "purpose": "The code implements an Azure SDK client for the Anomaly Detector API, facilitating configuration, URL formatting, request handling, and network communication with Azure services.",
  "sources": "Endpoint URL, AzureKeyCredential for authentication, HttpRequest objects for network requests.",
  "sinks": "The send_request method copies and formats HttpRequest objects, then transmits them via the Azure pipeline client.",
  "flows": "Input data (HttpRequest) is deep-copied, URL parameters are serialized and inserted, then the request is sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code follows standard SDK practices without malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Azure SDK client wrapper that manages request serialization and transmission. It employs standard practices such as request copying and URL formatting, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The deep copy prevents side effects, and URL serialization mitigates injection risks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are evident. The code's structure and logic are consistent with legitimate SDK implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Azure SDK client with no malicious intent or suspicious elements. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
