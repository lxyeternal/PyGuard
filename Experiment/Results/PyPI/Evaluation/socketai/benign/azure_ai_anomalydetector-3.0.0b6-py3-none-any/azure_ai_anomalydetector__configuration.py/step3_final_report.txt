  "purpose": "Configuration class for Azure's AnomalyDetectorClient, managing endpoint, credentials, and policies.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'endpoint' and 'credential'; policy initializations using provided arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; credentials are used internally for policy setup.",
  "flows": "Input validation flows from parameters to class attributes; policies are configured based on credentials and input arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK configuration class for Azure Cognitive Services, performing input validation, setting default API version, and initializing various policies. Credential handling is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic. No network activity or data exfiltration is present. Multiple reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores reflecting minimal security risk. Slight variations in risk scores (0.0 to 0.1) are justified by the inherent risks of credential management but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK configuration class with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
