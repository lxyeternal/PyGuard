  "purpose": "Define configuration class for Azure Anomaly Detector client, setting up policies and credentials.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters 'endpoint' and 'credential', environment variables or user input for credentials if used elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'endpoint' and 'credential' to configure network policies and headers; potential for misuse if credentials are compromised.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'endpoint' and 'credential' flow into policies such as AzureKeyCredentialPolicy, which are used for authentication during network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed. The code follows standard Azure SDK configuration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a configuration class for an Azure SDK client, initializing various policies and managing credentials securely through provided classes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; the code does not perform any network activity or data handling directly. It primarily manages client configuration and policy setup, with proper validation of critical parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of an Azure SDK, responsible for configuring client connection settings. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious injections are present.",
