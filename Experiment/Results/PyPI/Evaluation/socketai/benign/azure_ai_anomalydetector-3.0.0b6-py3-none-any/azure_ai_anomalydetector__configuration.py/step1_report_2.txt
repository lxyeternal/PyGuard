{
  "purpose": "Define configuration class for Azure Anomaly Detector client, setting up policies and credentials for API access.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'endpoint' and 'credential' in the constructor; environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or outputs, primarily setting internal state and policies.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes; credentials are used to configure policies, but no network or data transmission occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard credential handling and policy configuration with no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class for an Azure SDK client, initializing with endpoint and credential parameters. It performs input validation, sets default API version, and configures various policies required for HTTP communication. The credential is handled securely, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. No network activity or data leaks are present within this module. The structure follows standard SDK patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK configuration class that securely manages credentials and policies for Azure service interaction. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
