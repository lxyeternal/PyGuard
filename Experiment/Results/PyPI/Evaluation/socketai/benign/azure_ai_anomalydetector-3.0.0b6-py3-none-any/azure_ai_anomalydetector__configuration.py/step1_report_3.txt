  "purpose": "Define configuration class for Azure Anomaly Detector client with secure handling of credentials and policies.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'endpoint' and 'credential', imported modules, class constructor arguments, and optional keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as 'endpoint' and 'credential' stored in class attributes, used in policies.",
  "flows": "Credential provided at instantiation flows into policies like AzureKeyCredentialPolicy; 'endpoint' used for network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors. All parameters are used straightforwardly.",
  "analysis": "The code securely initializes a configuration object for an Azure client, validating 'endpoint' and 'credential'. It sets default API version and user agent. Policies are configured based on input or defaults, with credential policies properly using provided credentials. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code adheres to standard Azure SDK practices, managing sensitive info appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured configuration class for Azure SDK clients with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
