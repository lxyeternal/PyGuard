{
  "purpose": "Define configuration class for Azure Anomaly Detector client, managing credentials, endpoints, and policies.",
  "sources": "Reads credential object, endpoint string, and optional keyword arguments for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Uses credential object and endpoint string; no direct sink to untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "Credential and endpoint are passed into the constructor, then used to configure policies and authentication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code dynamically sets policies based on inputs. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class that manages the setup for an Azure client. It accepts credentials and endpoint URLs, validates their presence, and initializes policies based on parameters. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or secret leaks. Use of credentials is standard, and no insecure practices are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to common SDK patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured configuration class for Azure service clients with no malicious intent. It manages credentials and policies securely and transparently.",
