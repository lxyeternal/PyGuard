{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models for an anomaly detection SDK, including models for input parameters, responses, and error handling, intended for use with Azure services.",
  "sources": "None. The code primarily consists of class definitions and data serialization/deserialization logic, with no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None. The models do not include code that processes untrusted data directly or executes any side effects such as network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines data structures and their initializations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. It follows standard patterns for model definitions with type hints and optional fields.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of class definitions that extend a base model, with fields corresponding to API request and response schemas for anomaly detection. It includes type annotations, optional parameters, and standard initialization overloads. No input/output operations, network calls, or external command executions are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code snippets are identified. The code appears to be auto-generated from a schema or API spec, adhering to standard design patterns for SDK models.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, schema-defining module for an anomaly detection SDK. It contains no evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. It is likely auto-generated boilerplate code for data serialization/deserialization with no harmful behavior.",
