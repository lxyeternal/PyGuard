{
  "purpose": "The code defines data models for Azure anomaly detection SDK, primarily for serialization and deserialization of API requests and responses. It contains class definitions with attributes, overloads for JSON initialization, and no active logic.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only class attributes initialized via rest_field() and JSON mappings.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; purely data container classes with no runtime data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "Static class definitions with attribute assignments; no runtime data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no malicious code, no suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward, auto-generated SDK models.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data classes for API communication, with no network calls, file I/O, command execution, or dynamic code evaluation. It does not process untrusted input directly. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The structure and comments indicate standard auto-generated SDK models. No obfuscation techniques or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated set of data models for Azure anomaly detection SDK. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. It is safe for supply chain inclusion.",
