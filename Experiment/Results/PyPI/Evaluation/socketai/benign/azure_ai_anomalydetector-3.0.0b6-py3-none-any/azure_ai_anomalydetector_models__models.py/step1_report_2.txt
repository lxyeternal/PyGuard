{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models for an anomaly detection SDK, including models for handling input data, results, errors, and configuration options.",
  "sources": "The code reads from static Python class definitions, imported modules, and standard library functions. No external or untrusted data sources are used at runtime within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present. The models are primarily data structures for serialization/deserialization; there are no I/O or network operations within this code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs; the code only sets up data models with optional initialization from mappings or arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. It appears to be a standard, auto-generated data model module.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of class definitions for data models used in an anomaly detection SDK. It relies on inheritance from a base model and uses optional and union types for flexible data handling. There are no runtime data processing, network requests, or code execution functionalities. The code appears to be auto-generated from a specification, with no signs of malicious logic or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or potentially harmful code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of data models for an anomaly detection library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is unlikely to be exploited for supply chain attacks or malicious activity. The code is well-structured, standard, and primarily for data serialization purposes.",
