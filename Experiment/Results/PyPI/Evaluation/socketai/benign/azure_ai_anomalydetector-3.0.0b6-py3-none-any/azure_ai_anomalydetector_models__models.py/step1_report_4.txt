{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models for an anomaly detection system, including configurations, results, errors, and related entities used in the Azure Anomaly Detector SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, type annotations, and property initializations without user input, external data processing, or network calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or execute sensitive operations such as network communication, file access, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to model instantiation and data serialization/deserialization; no untrusted data flow to sensitive operations is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, secrets, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation. It is purely model definitions with standard serialization annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions that extend a base model, primarily using data annotations, optional fields, and type overloads. No external input handling, file or network I/O, or dynamic code execution is present. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is identifiable. The structure appears to be generated SDK model classes for API interactions, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data models for an Azure anomaly detection SDK, containing no suspicious or malicious elements. It is likely auto-generated for data serialization/deserialization and does not perform any harmful actions.",
