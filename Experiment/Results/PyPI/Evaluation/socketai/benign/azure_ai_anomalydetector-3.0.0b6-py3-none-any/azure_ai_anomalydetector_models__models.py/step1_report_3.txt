{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models for an anomaly detection system, including models for policies, detection results, errors, and configuration options, intended for use with Azure services.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters, including environment variables indirectly through Azure API interactions, and processes JSON-like input data for model initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include serialization/deserialization of models, network transmission to Azure API endpoints, and logging or error reporting mechanisms. No direct sinks of untrusted input to system commands or sensitive data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input JSON or API responses into model instances; these models may be serialized for API requests or responses, with no evident execution of untrusted code or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be purely data modeling with standard Python typing and inheritance. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of class definitions inheriting from a base model, with data fields defined via 'rest_field'. No dynamic code execution, eval, exec, or file system modifications are observed. No network calls, command executions, or data exfiltration routines are implemented within this snippet. The models are typical for API data handling, with no signs of malicious payloads or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of data model definitions for an anomaly detection API, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions solely as structured data containers for API communication.",
