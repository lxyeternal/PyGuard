  "purpose": "Define error codes for DNS errors based on the pycares library for use in exception handling.",
  "sources": "pycares.errno.errorcode dictionary containing error code mappings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Error code items are read from the pycares library and assigned to global variables; no data flow to external systems or sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of globals() to dynamically create variables from a dictionary, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pycares, iterates over its error code mappings, and assigns each error code to a global variable named after the error. This allows for easy reference to error codes by name. The code defines a custom exception class DNSError without additional functionality. No data input/output, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The dynamic assignment via globals() is unconventional but benign in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for setting error code constants, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It uses dynamic globals() assignment but does not perform any harmful actions.",
