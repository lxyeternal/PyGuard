{
  "purpose": "The code imports the pycares library and dynamically creates global variables for each error code defined in pycares.errno.errorcode; it also defines a custom exception DNSError.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the pycares library, specifically the errorcode dictionary.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or execution flow alteration.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading the errorcode items from pycares and assigning them to global variables; no untrusted input flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The dynamic creation of global variables based on external library data could potentially overwrite existing globals or introduce confusing namespace pollution, but this is not inherently malicious. No secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library and programmatically assigns error code names to global variables, which can be considered a risky practice if the library's errorcode dictionary were to be manipulated or maliciously altered, but generally this is standard usage. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are evident. The custom exception DNSError is straightforward and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup for handling pycares error codes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The dynamic globals creation could be potentially confusing but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
