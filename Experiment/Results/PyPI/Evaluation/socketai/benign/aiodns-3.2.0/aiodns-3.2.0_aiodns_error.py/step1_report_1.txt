{
  "purpose": "The code appears to load error codes from the pycares library into global variables and defines a custom exception class for DNS errors.",
  "sources": "Reading data from pycares.errno.errorcode, which is an external library providing error codes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that lead to data leaks, code execution, or other security effects are present.",
  "flows": "Error codes are assigned to global variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The dynamic assignment of global variables from a dictionary could be misused to overwrite existing variables or inject unexpected global entries, but in this context, it seems straightforward. No malicious patterns like code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pycares library and iterates over its error code dictionary to create global variables named after each error. This process is simple and intended to make error codes accessible globally. The custom exception class DNSError is standard and not suspicious. No external input, untrusted data, or dynamic code execution mechanisms are present. The pattern of populating globals from an external dictionary is common for error handling and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility snippet for error handling related to pycares DNS operations. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
