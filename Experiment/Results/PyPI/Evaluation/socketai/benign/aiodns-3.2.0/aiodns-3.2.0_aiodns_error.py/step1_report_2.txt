  "purpose": "Define error code constants from pycares and a custom DNSError exception class.",
  "sources": "Access to pycares.errno.errorcode dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data or untrusted input used in a way that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Reading errorcode items to create global variables; no flow to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic creation of global variables using eval-like approach; this could be risky if errorcode contents are malicious, but unlikely as it’s a standard library dictionary.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pycares and iterates over its errorcode dictionary to set global variables named after each error name with their corresponding code values. This pattern is common for creating convenient error constants. There are no input sources that accept untrusted data; the only data source is a static dictionary from a third-party library. No sinks or sensitive operations are present. The code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. The dynamic globals creation is not inherently malicious but could be misused if the errorcode data was maliciously altered, which is unlikely for a standard library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard pattern for defining error constants from a third-party library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
