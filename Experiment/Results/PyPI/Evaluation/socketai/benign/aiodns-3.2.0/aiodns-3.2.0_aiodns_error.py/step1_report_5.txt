{
  "purpose": "Define an exception class for DNS errors and import error codes from the pycares library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the pycares.errno.errorcode dictionary to assign error code values to global variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Error codes are read from the library and assigned to globals, with no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code simply imports data and dynamically creates global variables. The use of globals could be considered unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pycares library and iterates over its errorcode dictionary to set global variables with error names as keys and codes as values. It then defines a custom exception class for DNS errors. There is no input handling, no data transmission, and no suspicious behavior. The dynamic assignment of globals is uncommon but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for mapping DNS error codes and defining an exception class. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The use of globals is somewhat unconventional but not suspicious. Overall, the code appears safe.",
