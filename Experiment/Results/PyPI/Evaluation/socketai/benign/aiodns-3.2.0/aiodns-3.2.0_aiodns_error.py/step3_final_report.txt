  "purpose": "Assigns error codes from pycares.errno.errorcode to global variables and defines a custom DNSError exception.",
  "sources": "pycares.errno.errorcode dictionary",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Iterates over errorcode items to assign each code to a global variable",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic assignment to globals via globals()[name], which is unconventional but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted library, iterates over a static dictionary to assign error codes to globals, and defines a simple exception. No untrusted input, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The pattern of dynamic globals creation is unusual but standard for error constants. No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or obfuscation. The security implications are minimal, and the code is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for error code definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The dynamic globals pattern, while unconventional, does not pose a threat in this context. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
