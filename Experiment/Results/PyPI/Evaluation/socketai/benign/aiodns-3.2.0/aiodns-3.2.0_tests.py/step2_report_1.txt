  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes unit tests for aiodns, reading from external DNS servers and environment info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; DNS queries and results are processed within tests, no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified; high confidence (0.95). No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (correct)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- securityRisk: 0 (appropriate given the analysis)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes DNS tests with hardcoded domain names/IPs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard DNS queries, no data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Reasonable; confidence at 0.9, and no malware suspected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- securityRisk: 0.1 — minor, but acceptable given the controlled environment.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity or sabotage detected. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes a standard DNS test suite.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** DNS queries are controlled, no untrusted data sources.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified; high confidence, no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (correct)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- securityRisk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes DNS resolution tests with controlled inputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard network operations, no data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate; high confidence, no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (correct)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- securityRisk: 0.1 — minor, but consistent with safe testing.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity or sabotage. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard DNS tests with network interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Typical DNS queries and network operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified; high confidence, no malware suspected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- securityRisk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are consistent in assigning 0, which is correct. The code is a straightforward DNS test suite with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), reflecting minimal concern for network interactions but justified given the controlled environment.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity or code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minor network interactions, typical for testing, not indicative of security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports' scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's analysis. The code is a standard, well-structured DNS testing suite with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
