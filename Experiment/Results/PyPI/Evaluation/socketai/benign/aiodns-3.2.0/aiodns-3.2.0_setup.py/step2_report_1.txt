  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious patterns. The version extraction via regex from a static file is common practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the setup script and safe file reads. No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns; standard setup script.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code performs typical package setup tasks with safe file reads and regex parsing. No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning; standard setup script, no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; standard package setup, safe version extraction, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, standard, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate reasoning.\n- **Score consistency:** All assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Malware justification:** Since there's no malicious activity, malware score remains 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** The code performs static setup tasks with safe file reads; no vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Based on all information, I agree with the provided scores.** The code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action needed.",
