{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'aiodns', used for configuring package metadata and installation details.",
  "sources": "The code reads the content of 'aiodns/__init__.py' to extract the version string, and reads 'README.rst' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute or process untrusted data; no network, file, or system commands are invoked with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The version string from 'aiodns/__init__.py' flows from the get_version() function into the setup() function's version parameter. The long description flows from reading 'README.rst' into setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard setup operations with straightforward file reads and regex parsing.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines a function to extract the version from a specific source file. It then calls setuptools.setup() with static and dynamically read parameters. The version extraction relies on regex parsing of a specific file, which appears safe given typical usage. No code injection, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are evident. The package metadata and requirements are standard and do not pose security risks. The code does not include any network calls, credential handling, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely reads metadata from files and supplies them to the setup function. No malware or security threats are detected.",
