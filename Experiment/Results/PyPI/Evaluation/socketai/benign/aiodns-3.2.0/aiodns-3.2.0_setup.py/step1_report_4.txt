{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the Python package 'aiodns', used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of 'aiodns/__init__.py' to extract version information, reads 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data from external sources is processed or outputted in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "Version extraction from the package's __init__.py file; reading README file for long description. No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to parse version info is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using setuptools. The get_version() function reads a file and applies regex to extract version info, which is a common pattern. Reading files with codecs and open is safe here. No dynamic code execution, no external data processing, no suspicious functions or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python module. It contains no malicious code or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
