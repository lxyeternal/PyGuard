  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a standard Python `setup.py` script for packaging.\n- Reads the version string from `aiodns/__init__.py` via regex.\n- Reads the long description from `README.rst`.\n- Uses `setuptools.setup()` with typical package metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly reads the version info and sets up the package.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no malware, no suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None evident; standard safe practices are used.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code only reads static files and sets metadata.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n- All five reports uniformly state that the code is a standard setup script, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- They agree that the regex-based version extraction is common and safe.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The confidence scores are all at 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code does not process untrusted input at runtime; all file reads are from local, trusted files.\n- The regex parsing is standard and safe.\n- No signs of backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I concur that:**\n\n- **Malware score should remain at 0.**\n- **Obfuscated score should remain at 0.**\n- **Risk score should be 0.**\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis is a safe, standard package setup script with no security concerns.",
