{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing the 'aiodns' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'aiodns/__init__.py' file to extract the version string, and reads 'README.rst' for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leakage points are present; the script mainly performs safe file reads and package setup.",
  "flows": "Version string extracted from 'aiodns/__init__.py' flows into the 'version' parameter of setup; the README content flows into 'long_description'.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a regex to extract version from a file is a common pattern and not inherently suspicious. No secrets, credentials, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, uses a regex to dynamically retrieve the package version from the init file, and calls 'setuptools.setup' with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No code injection, malicious behavior, or security risks detected. No external untrusted data handling beyond file reads, which are safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
