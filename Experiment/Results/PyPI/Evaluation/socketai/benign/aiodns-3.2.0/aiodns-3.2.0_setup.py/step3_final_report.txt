{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'aiodns' Python package, defining package metadata and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'aiodns/__init__.py' via regex; reads long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads only.",
  "flows": "Static data from files to package metadata; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script performing static reads and package configuration. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input processing is present. Regex parsing of version is standard practice. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No anomalies or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
