{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'aiodns' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'aiodns/__init__.py' file to extract the version string, and the 'README.rst' file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or data at runtime; it only reads static files for setup purposes.",
  "flows": "The version string extraction reads from a file and uses regex matching; the setup function uses the extracted version and static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard setup procedures; no obfuscated or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static setup configuration tasks: reading version info from a file and setting package metadata. It uses regex to parse version info, which is a common pattern in Python package setups. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code adheres to typical packaging standards and does not include any malicious constructs or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply automates package metadata configuration.",
