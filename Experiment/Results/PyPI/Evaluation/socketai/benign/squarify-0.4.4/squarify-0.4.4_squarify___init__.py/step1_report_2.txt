{
  "purpose": "This code implements the squarified treemap layout algorithm for visualizing hierarchical data with rectangle areas proportional to data values, including functions for normalization, padding, and plotting with Matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'sizes' parameter and optional parameters such as 'label', 'value', and plotting configuration inputs. It also accesses the Matplotlib library for visualization.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visualizations via Matplotlib's plotting functions. It does not send data over the network, modify system files, or perform any system-altering operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'sizes' are normalized and then processed to compute rectangles; these are visualized with Matplotlib. No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks such as network, filesystem, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors, are present. The code relies on standard libraries and straightforward algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a complete implementation of the squarified treemap layout algorithm, including normalization, layout calculations, padding, and plotting. It uses standard Python constructs and the Matplotlib library for visualization. No external data sources, network operations, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be a standard visualization utility with no hidden or malicious functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a treemap layout algorithm with visualization capabilities. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, and there are no security risks identified. It appears safe for use.",
