{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute and visualize squarified treemaps for hierarchical data, including layout calculations, normalization, and plotting with Matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Reads input sizes (numeric data), user parameters, and external libraries (Matplotlib) for visualization.",
  "sinks": "Outputs visualizations via Matplotlib; no external data flow, network activity, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Processes input sizes -> computes layout rectangles -> visualizes with Matplotlib functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard treemap layout algorithms with straightforward functions for layout, normalization, and plotting. It relies solely on user-provided data and standard libraries. No network activity, external data sources, or malicious logic are present. The color randomization is benign. The code is well-structured, readable, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a treemap visualization utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe, benign behavior.",
