  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'squarify' Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, author, description, license, keywords, classifiers, url.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, inputs, or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious constructs or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed, hardcoded package metadata. It does not perform any input handling, code execution, network communication, or dynamic processing. All reports correctly identify its benign, static nature. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The confidence level of 1 reflects certainty in this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign package configuration script with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and security risk categories.",
  "confidence": 1,
