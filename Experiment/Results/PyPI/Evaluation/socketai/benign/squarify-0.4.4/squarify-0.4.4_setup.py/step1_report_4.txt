{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'squarify' Python library.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code strictly follows standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static package metadata such as name, version, author info, description, license, keywords, classifiers, and URL. All data is hardcoded, and there are no dynamic or runtime inputs, environment variables, or code execution. The structure and content are typical for a Python package setup file, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply provides metadata for package distribution.",
