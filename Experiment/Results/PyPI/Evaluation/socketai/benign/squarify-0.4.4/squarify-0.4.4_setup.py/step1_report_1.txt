{
  "purpose": "To define package metadata and configuration for building and distributing the 'squarify' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() function such as package name, version, author info, description, license, keywords, classifiers, and URL.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or input sources present; no sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all data is static and hardcoded in the setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and contains no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static, predefined parameters to specify package details. No input handling, data processing, or dynamic execution occurs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent. It solely provides package metadata without any suspicious or malicious code.",
