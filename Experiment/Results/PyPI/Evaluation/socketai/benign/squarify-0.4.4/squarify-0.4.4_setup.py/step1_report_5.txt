  "purpose": "To define and configure the packaging information for the 'squarify' Python library, including metadata such as name, version, author, description, license, keywords, classifiers, and URL.",
  "sources": "N/A - this code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "N/A - this code does not write data or interact with untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A - there are no data flows from source to sink in this static setup script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls the setup() function with static, hardcoded metadata for the package. There are no dynamic inputs, user inputs, or external data processing. The script solely provides package configuration details without executing any suspicious or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
