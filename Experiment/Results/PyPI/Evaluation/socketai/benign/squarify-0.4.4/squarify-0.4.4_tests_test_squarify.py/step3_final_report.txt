{
  "purpose": "Unit test verifying the correctness of the squarify treemap layout algorithm with fixed input data and expected output rectangles.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded input values [500, 433, 78, 25, 25, 7], imported functions from squarify library",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no network or file I/O, no external data processing",
  "flows": "Input sizes are normalized via normalize_sizes, then passed to squarify to generate layout rectangles, which are compared against expected values",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded expected outputs, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, no secrets or credentials",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test for a visualization layout library, importing functions from a trusted external library, normalizing fixed input data, and asserting the output matches predefined expected rectangles. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The test is deterministic and controlled, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured unit test verifying layout correctness. No malicious or security-risk elements are present. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, and no adjustments are necessary.",
