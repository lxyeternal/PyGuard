  "purpose": "The code tests the squarify layout algorithm for treemaps by normalizing input sizes and verifying the output rectangles against expected values.",
  "sources": "Input values array [500, 433, 78, 25, 25, 7] used for normalization; functions normalize_sizes and squarify imported from the squarify library.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted input or data leaks; no external data output or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input values are normalized via normalize_sizes, then passed to squarify to generate layout rectangles; test assertions compare the output against expected rectangle coordinates and dimensions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward, containing only test assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a unit test for the squarify treemap layout algorithm. It normalizes fixed input sizes and verifies the layout output against predefined expected rectangle positions and sizes. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are used. The functions called are from an external, well-known library. The code contains only assertions for validation and does not perform any network communication, data storage, or other potentially malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard test script verifying the correctness of a layout algorithm with no malicious intent. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code is safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
