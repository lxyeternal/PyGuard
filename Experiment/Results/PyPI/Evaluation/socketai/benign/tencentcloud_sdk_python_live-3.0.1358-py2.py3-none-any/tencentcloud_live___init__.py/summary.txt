  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, but reports with high obfuscation and dynamic execution suspicion should be scored higher for malware (around 0.5). The overall security risk remains moderate (~0.4). Adjustments to malware scores in reports 3 and 5 improve alignment with observed suspicious features. Further analysis is advised for confirmation."
