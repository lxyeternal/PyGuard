  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input/output functions, environment variables, network connections, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file write/read, environment variable access, potential command execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs to sinks like network connections or file operations, possibly via dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, dynamic code execution suspicion, unusual variable naming, potential hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and potential dynamic execution in certain reports, raising suspicion of malicious intent. Benign reports show standard patterns with no suspicious activity. Slightly elevated malware scores in reports with obfuscation are justified. The overall pattern suggests that obfuscation and dynamic features are red flags warranting cautious scoring. The scores are consistent with the descriptions, with minor adjustments recommended for reports 3 and 5 to better reflect suspicion levels.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, but reports with high obfuscation and dynamic execution suspicion should be scored higher for malware (around 0.5). The overall security risk remains moderate (~0.4). Adjustments to malware scores in reports 3 and 5 improve alignment with observed suspicious features. Further analysis is advised for confirmation.",
