  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only contains comments and a version string assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing comments and a version string; there are no unusual or suspicious code elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing information, comments, and a version variable assignment. There are no executable functions, data processing, or data input/output operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable from this fragment. It is typical of open-source packages to include such licensing headers. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard license header and version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and typical of open-source project files.",
