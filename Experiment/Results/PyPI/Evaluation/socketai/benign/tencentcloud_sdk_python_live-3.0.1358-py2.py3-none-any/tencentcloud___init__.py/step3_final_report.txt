  "purpose": "This code serves as a licensing header and version declaration for an open-source project, providing legal and versioning information without any executable logic.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = '3.0.1358') and licensing comments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions are present; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output operations, or untrusted data sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code elements are present; the code is purely comments and a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no executable code, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and justified. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard open-source license header and version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The provided reports accurately assess its benign nature, and no modifications are necessary.",
