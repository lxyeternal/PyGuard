{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing various error and status codes related to Tencent Cloud services, primarily focusing on media, certification, domain, and resource management errors.",
  "sources": "The code consists solely of constant variable definitions. No input or data reading occurs within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no functions or processes where untrusted data flows to potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Since there are only static constant definitions, there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a comprehensive enumeration of error codes with standard naming conventions, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual code constructs. The licensing comments are typical and unrelated to malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining string constants for various error codes. It includes licensing comments and standard variable assignments. No input handling, external data fetching, or dynamic execution is present. The structure and content appear typical for a constants module in an SDK or API client library. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of constant definitions for error/status codes, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is likely part of an SDK or API response handling module, serving as a reference for different error scenarios.",
