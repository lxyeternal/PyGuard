  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of constant error codes and messages for use in an API or SDK, primarily related to Tencent Cloud services and operations.",
  "sources": "Constants defining error codes and messages, likely used for exception handling or API response interpretation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or input handling are present; this file is solely for defining static constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or input-to-output paths; the code consists only of constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The content is a straightforward list of error code constants with descriptive names and string values.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a static collection of error code constants for error handling within a Tencent Cloud SDK or API. The constants are categorized into various groups such as authorization failures, resource issues, internal errors, parameter errors, and more. There is no code execution, input processing, or external data handling. The content appears to be a well-structured, static error code mapping without any malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error code definitions module, used for error handling and messaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. It is a benign static resource for consistent error reporting.",
