  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward set of static string constants defining error codes and messages for Tencent Cloud SDKs/APIs. There are no dynamic behaviors, data flows, or executable logic. The constants are well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The licensing comments are standard and unrelated to security concerns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. They emphasize the absence of data flows, dynamic code, or external dependencies. No logical flaws are evident in the assessments.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty that the code is safe. These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports assign a risk score of 0, indicating no security risk, and the code is just static constants, this is justified. No higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting that there is no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports base their conclusions on the static nature of the code, which is accurate. No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—benign, static, non-malicious constants with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk, just static error code definitions)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis code is a standard, benign set of error code constants used for error handling in an SDK or API client. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation**: No changes needed. The code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
