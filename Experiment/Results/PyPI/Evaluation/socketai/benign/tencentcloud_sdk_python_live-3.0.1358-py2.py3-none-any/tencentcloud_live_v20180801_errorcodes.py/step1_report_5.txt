{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of constant string variables representing various error codes and messages related to Tencent Cloud services, particularly for media, security, and resource management operations.",
  "sources": "These constants are static string assignments within the code, not reading external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks where untrusted data is processed or outputted; the code solely defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not perform any data processing or control flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive error code definitions with descriptive comments, including some for authorization, resource, and internal errors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "This script is a collection of predefined error code constants for use in Tencent Cloud SDKs or APIs. It provides mappings for various error scenarios, aiding in error handling and debugging. The code appears to be standard and well-documented, with no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The constants are static, indicating a focus on error handling, and there is no indication of code injection, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. All comments and code structure align with typical SDK or API response definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constant definitions for error codes and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve as part of a larger SDK or service error handling framework, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
