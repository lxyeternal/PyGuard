{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive set of static string constants representing error codes and messages for Tencent Cloud SDKs/APIs, serving as a reference for error handling and messaging.",
  "sources": "The code consists solely of static constant definitions; no input reading or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process or output data dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is purely declarative with static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of string constants defining error codes and messages, typical for SDKs or API clients. It contains no dynamic logic, external interactions, or obfuscation. The constants are well-documented and serve as a reference for error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident. The high confidence scores (1) and malware score (0) are justified given the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration of error codes used in an SDK or API client. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores are consistent with its content, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
