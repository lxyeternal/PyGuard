{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of constant string values representing error codes and messages for a Tencent cloud SDK or API client.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data; it solely declares constants.",
  "sinks": "No data flow or untrusted data handling; the code only contains static string assignments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code consists only of constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code contains only static string constants for error codes and messages.",
  "analysis": "The file is a collection of error code constants used for error handling in Tencent cloud services. It includes various error categories such as authorization failures, resource not found, internal errors, parameter errors, resource conflicts, and limitations. There is no code execution, data handling, external calls, or suspicious logic. The structure is straightforward, serving as a reference for error codes. No malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage indicators are present. The only potential concern would be if these constants were used maliciously, but there is no evidence of that here; they are standard error code definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of constant definitions for error handling in a cloud SDK. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this file. It appears to be a benign component used for error messaging.",
