  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports clearly state that the code consists solely of static string constants defining error codes and messages.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external calls, or dynamic code segments.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated segments, or malicious behaviors are indicated.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward enumeration of error codes, typical for SDKs or API clients.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n   - The comments and naming conventions are standard and consistent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature of static constants.\n   - The confidence levels are 1, reflecting high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No suspicious claims are made; all reports support that this is a benign constants module.\n   - The purpose is clearly to serve as error code definitions, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - Given the content, these scores are appropriate.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n   - It does not contain obfuscated or hidden logic.\n   - The licensing comments are standard and do not raise concerns.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a benign, static set of error code constants typical for an SDK or API client. It does not pose any security threat, contain malware, or exhibit obfuscation. It is a standard, safe component used for error handling and messaging.",
