{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of string constants representing error codes and messages used in a Tencent Cloud SDK or API client for handling various operational, configuration, and permission issues.",
  "sources": "The code sources error code constants, which are typically used as identifiers for different error conditions within the SDK or API responses.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain direct sinks for untrusted data, user input, or external commands. It mainly provides static string constants for error codes.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the constants are static and used for error handling and messaging.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of static constant definitions; there are no dynamic code behaviors, obfuscated segments, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of string constant definitions for error codes and messages. It is typical for SDKs or API clients to define such constants for consistent error handling. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious operations. The structure and content align with standard SDK error code definitions. No external data processing or execution logic exists that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as a static reference for error codes within a Tencent Cloud SDK or API client. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a normal component for structured error handling.",
