  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility script that performs a calculation or data processing task, likely intended for general use.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, user input, environment variables, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions like print(), logging, network transmissions, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input points) through processing functions to sinks (output or external communication).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python syntax. It does not contain any suspicious functions, data leaks, or suspicious external calls. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The absence of malicious behaviors or anomalies suggests it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a safe utility script with no security concerns.",
