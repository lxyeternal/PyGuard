  "purpose": "Defines a Pulumi provider class for Azure, handling authentication parameters securely and configuring provider options.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for credentials, environment, and configuration; secrets are handled via Pulumi's secret mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "Secrets stored as Pulumi secrets; no external network, file I/O, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into internal properties; secrets are wrapped and stored securely; no external data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK component for Pulumi's Azure provider. It manages sensitive data securely, uses clear patterns, and lacks network or file operations. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The handling of secrets via Pulumi's secret API indicates good security practices. The code's structure and content are consistent with legitimate SDK code, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, auto-generated Pulumi Azure provider class. It handles secrets properly, shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity, and functions as intended for configuration purposes.",
