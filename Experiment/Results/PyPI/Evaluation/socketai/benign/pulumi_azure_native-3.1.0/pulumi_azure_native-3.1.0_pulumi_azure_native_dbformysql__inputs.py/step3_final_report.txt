{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of auto-generated Pulumi input classes and data structures for configuring Azure resources such as MySQL servers, backups, encryption, network settings, and related properties. It serves as a declarative SDK for infrastructure provisioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters via constructor arguments and internal property setters; no external data sources, network calls, or untrusted inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code only sets internal properties and retrieves configuration values within Pulumi's framework.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into internal Pulumi set() calls, which store configuration data. No external data flows, network operations, or code execution occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is standard auto-generated SDK boilerplate for resource configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of declarative data classes and argument structures for Azure resource configuration via Pulumi. It performs straightforward property assignments and retrievals, with no external data processing, network activity, or code injection. The code comments explicitly state that the files are generated and should not be manually edited, indicating their SDK or IaC nature. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the code's purpose as infrastructure configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard auto-generated Pulumi SDK classes for Azure resource configuration. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
