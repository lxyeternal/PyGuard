{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple data classes and argument structures for configuring Azure resources via Pulumi, primarily related to server setup, storage, network, and security settings.",
  "sources": "Data class constructors, property getters/setters, default value assignments, import statements, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Pulumi.set() calls, property getters, and potential data outputs from the classes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class constructors, which invoke pulumi.set() to store values; getters retrieve stored values. Data flows from input arguments through class properties into Pulumi resource configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data present. No evidence of code injection, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The code includes a warning comment indicating it was generated by Pulumi, which is standard for infrastructure as code scripts. No suspicious network operations, file manipulations, or system commands observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining configuration data structures for resource provisioning. There are no suspicious or malicious actions such as network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The usage of Pulumi's set and get functions is standard for managing infrastructure configurations. The presence of a warning comment about generated code is typical and does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for its purpose of defining resource arguments and properties.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of data classes and argument structures for resource configuration with Pulumi. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It is safe and typical for infrastructure as code. The overall security risk score is low.",
