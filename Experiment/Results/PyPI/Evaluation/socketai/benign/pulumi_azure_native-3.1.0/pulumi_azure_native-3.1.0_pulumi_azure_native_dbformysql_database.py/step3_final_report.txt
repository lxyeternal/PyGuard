  "purpose": "Generated Pulumi classes for managing Azure database resources, including input arguments and property accessors.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for resource configuration, property getters for resource attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters used for resource setup; no external or malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is boilerplate generated SDK code for Azure database resources, following standard patterns. It handles resource arguments, property accessors, and resource lookup functions without executing commands, network calls, or handling sensitive data insecurely. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate infrastructure as code practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate Pulumi resource class implementation for Azure databases. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The minimal security risk score reflects the inherent risks of misconfiguration in IaC scripts, not actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
