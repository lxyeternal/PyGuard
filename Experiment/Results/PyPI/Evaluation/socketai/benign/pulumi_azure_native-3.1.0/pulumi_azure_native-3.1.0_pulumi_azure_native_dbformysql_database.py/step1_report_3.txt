{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Pulumi resource class for managing Azure Database resources, including argument structures and resource management logic.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters from function arguments, class properties, and Pulumi's input types. No external or untrusted sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Uses Pulumi's set and get functions to assign and retrieve resource properties; no direct data sinks such as network connections or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource property assignments via Pulumi's internal mechanisms; no untrusted data flow or external data exfiltration paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code is a standard resource class implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi resource class for managing Azure Database resources, with proper type annotations and resource options handling. It primarily initializes resource properties, manages arguments, and provides accessors. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. There are no network operations, credential handling, or cryptographic functions that could pose security risks. The comments and structure suggest standard SDK code generation with no signs of tampering.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign Pulumi resource class implementation for Azure databases. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe for use within a Pulumi infrastructure management context.",
