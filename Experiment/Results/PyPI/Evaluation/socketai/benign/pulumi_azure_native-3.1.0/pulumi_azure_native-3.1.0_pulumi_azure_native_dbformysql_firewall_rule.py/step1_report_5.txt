  "purpose": "Define Pulumi classes and functions for managing Azure Database for MySQL Firewall Rules.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters, environment variables (via Pulumi's internal mechanisms), and Pulumi resource options.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to Pulumi resource properties and outputs; no direct external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource properties; resource initialization passes data to Azure API via Pulumi SDK.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code detected. The warning comment indicates generated code, not obfuscated or malicious. No unusual code constructs or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pulumi resource definition for managing Azure MySQL Firewall Rules, including argument classes, property getters/setters, and resource constructors. It handles input validation and resource aliasing for multiple API versions. No indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is structurally typical for Pulumi resource modules, with no suspicious logic or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Pulumi resource module for Azure, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages configuration data and resource definitions without external or malicious effects.",
