{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi classes for managing Azure MySQL firewall rules, allowing infrastructure as code deployment.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as end_ip_address, start_ip_address, resource_group_name, server_name, and firewall_rule_name; these are passed to resource constructors and property setters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit data sinks that send data over the network, write files, or perform system modifications beyond resource creation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from constructor parameters and property setters into resource properties, which are then used by Pulumi SDK to manage Azure resources; no untrusted data is processed in a malicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is well-structured, with standard Pulumi resource definitions and argument handling. No obfuscation or malicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for managing Azure MySQL firewall rules using Pulumi. It uses standard patterns for resource arguments, resource initialization, and property access. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or malicious system modifications are evident. The input parameters are typical for resource configuration, and the code strictly handles infrastructure provisioning, with no dynamic code execution or external communication observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Pulumi resource definition for Azure MySQL firewall rules with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It is safe and primarily focused on infrastructure management.",
