  "purpose": "Define classes for managing Azure MySQL firewall rules using Pulumi infrastructure as code framework.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for IP addresses, resource group, server name, firewall rule name, and resource ID.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to resource properties, used for resource creation and management via Pulumi SDK.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code mainly sets up data models and resource definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pulumi resource definition for Azure MySQL firewall rules, with classes, property getters/setters, and resource initialization logic. It includes multiple API version aliases and ensures required parameters are provided. No signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated behavior, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Pulumi resource class definition for managing Azure MySQL firewall rules. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behaviors. It is a typical infrastructure as code module with no malicious intent.",
