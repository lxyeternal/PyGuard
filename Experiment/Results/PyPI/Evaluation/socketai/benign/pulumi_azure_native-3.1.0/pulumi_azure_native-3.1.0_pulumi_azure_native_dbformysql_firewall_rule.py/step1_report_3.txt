  "purpose": "Define classes and resources for managing Azure MySQL firewall rules using Pulumi infrastructure as code.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for firewall rule properties, including IP addresses, resource group, server name, and optional rule name.",
  "sinks": "Property getters that return resource attribute outputs; no direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are assigned to resource properties, and output properties (sinks) are retrieved from resource instances; no evident malicious flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code structure follows standard Pulumi resource definitions. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up classes for defining and retrieving Azure MySQL firewall rules via Pulumi. It handles input parameters securely, with proper type checking and property management. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling occurs within this module. The only external interactions are Pulumi's API calls, which are standard for resource provisioning. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate Pulumi resource definition for managing Azure MySQL firewall rules. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It follows standard practices for infrastructure as code without suspicious or malicious modifications.",
