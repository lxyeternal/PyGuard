{
  "purpose": "Defines Pulumi classes for managing Azure MySQL firewall rules, including argument and resource classes with properties and API version aliases.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for resource creation, resource property getters",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or data exfiltration points",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource properties; no external or untrusted data flows observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated SDK for resource management, following standard patterns for Pulumi resources. It includes argument classes with property setters/getters, resource constructors with aliasing for API versions, and property accessors. No network activity, external communication, or malicious logic is present. The code is purely declarative infrastructure code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's nature and pose minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, generated Pulumi SDK code for managing Azure MySQL firewall rules. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
