{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes to retrieve information about an Azure database resource via Pulumi SDK, primarily for infrastructure as code automation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'database_name', 'resource_group_name', and 'server_name' in 'get_database' and 'get_database_output' functions.",
  "sinks": "The invoke calls to 'pulumi.runtime.invoke' and 'pulumi.runtime.invoke_output', which communicate with Azure's API endpoints to fetch resource data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'pulumi.runtime.invoke' and 'invoke_output', which then fetch data from Azure APIs and return structured resource information; no untrusted user input is directly executed or embedded in commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; use of standard Pulumi SDK methods for resource querying.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes and functions to query Azure resource details using Pulumi's SDK, adhering to proper type checks and API usage. No dynamic code execution, command injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. It utilizes safe and standard SDK practices to obtain resource information. The parameters are standard resource identifiers, and their handling appears safe. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic are identified. The invocation calls interact with external APIs but are part of standard infrastructure code, not malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard infrastructure management code for querying Azure database resources via Pulumi SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe with respect to supply chain and runtime security. No malicious intent or harmful behavior detected.",
