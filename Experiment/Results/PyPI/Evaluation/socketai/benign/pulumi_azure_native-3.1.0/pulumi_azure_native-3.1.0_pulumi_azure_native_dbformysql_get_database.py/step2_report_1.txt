  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Purpose & Functionality**:  \n   The code provides classes and functions to retrieve Azure database resource information via Pulumi SDK. It uses standard SDK calls (`pulumi.runtime.invoke`, `pulumi.get`, etc.) and performs input validation and data encapsulation. The code appears to be auto-generated, as indicated by comments.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:  \n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - No dynamic code execution, command injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.\n   - The functions are straightforward wrappers around Pulumi SDK calls to Azure APIs.\n   - No suspicious network activity or external communication beyond standard API calls.\n   - The code adheres to standard practices for infrastructure as code and resource querying.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:  \n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is standard, auto-generated Pulumi SDK code for Azure resource data retrieval.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and very low security risk (~0.1-0.2).\n   - The confidence level is high (~0.9), indicating they agree on the benign nature.\n   - No report mentions any anomalies, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n4. **Scores Justification**:  \n   - **Malware Score (0)**: The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or payloads.\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: The code is clear, auto-generated, with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score (~0.1-0.2)**: Slightly above zero, mainly due to the fact that it performs external API calls, but these are standard and expected in infrastructure code.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:  \n   - The only possible concern could be misuse of the invoke functions if inputs are maliciously crafted, but in this context, these are just resource identifiers.\n   - The code is auto-generated, which reduces suspicion but warrants caution if the source is untrusted. However, no evidence of malicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:  \n   - The code is a standard Pulumi resource wrapper for Azure database info retrieval.\n   - No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n   - The scores assigned by reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (or 0.2) — reflecting minimal inherent risk in API calls but no malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and does not pose security risks or contain malicious behavior. The supply chain security is intact based on this analysis.",
