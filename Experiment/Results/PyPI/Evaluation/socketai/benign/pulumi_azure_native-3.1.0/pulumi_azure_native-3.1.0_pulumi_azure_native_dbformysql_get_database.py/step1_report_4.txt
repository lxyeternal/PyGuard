{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to retrieve database information from Azure using Pulumi SDK, with class definitions for handling database result data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: database_name, resource_group_name, server_name; data retrieval via pulumi.runtime.invoke and invoke_output functions.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from pulumi.runtime.invoke and apply functions, used to populate GetDatabaseResult objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> invoke functions -> data returned and processed into GetDatabaseResult objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard Pulumi SDK functions and type annotations. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution found. No unusual behaviors, data leaks, or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Pulumi SDK-based resource data fetcher for Azure, with well-structured classes and functions. It only reads input parameters and invokes cloud API calls, returning structured data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate, with standard error handling and property accessors. No sensitive information or secrets are hardcoded. Overall, the code is a safe, standard SDK wrapper for Azure resource data retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Pulumi SDK wrapper for Azure database resource information retrieval. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on the code content and structure.",
