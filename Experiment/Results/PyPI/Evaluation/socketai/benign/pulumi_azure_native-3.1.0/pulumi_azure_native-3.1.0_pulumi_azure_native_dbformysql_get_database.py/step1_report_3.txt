{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Pulumi resource type and functions for retrieving database information from Azure, specifically for the 'dbformysql' service. It is used to interact with Azure REST APIs to obtain database metadata.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (database_name, resource_group_name, server_name); internal Pulumi invoke calls fetching resource data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if sensitive inputs are logged or mishandled; Pulumi's invoke output could be used maliciously if misused, but no explicit data exfiltration code is present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to internal Pulumi invoke functions; responses are processed and returned as resource objects; no untrusted data flows into insecure sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code primarily handles data retrieval and type checking. The warning comment suggests auto-generated code, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pulumi resource definition and API wrapper for Azure database resources. It includes type checks, API versioning, and resource metadata handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity. The use of Pulumi's APIs appears legitimate, and there are no embedded commands, code injections, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The warnings about generated code do not indicate malicious intent but caution against manual edits. The code's structure and purpose are consistent with cloud infrastructure automation, with no indications of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, auto-generated Pulumi resource wrapper for Azure databases. It performs standard API interactions and data handling without any malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
