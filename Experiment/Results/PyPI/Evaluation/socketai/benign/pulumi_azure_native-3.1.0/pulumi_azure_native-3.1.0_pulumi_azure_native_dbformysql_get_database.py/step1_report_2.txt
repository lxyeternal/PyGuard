{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes to retrieve database information from Azure using Pulumi's SDK, mainly for infrastructure as code automation.",
  "sources": "Data sources include function parameters ('database_name', 'resource_group_name', 'server_name') and Pulumi's internal invoke functions to fetch resource data from Azure.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve the use of 'pulumi.runtime.invoke' and 'pulumi.get' functions which could process untrusted input, though in this context they are used to fetch resource data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the 'get_database' and 'get_database_output' functions, which then call Pulumi's invoke methods; retrieved data is processed and returned as 'GetDatabaseResult' objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage of Pulumi's SDK functions is standard; no suspicious network activity or file operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pulumi SDK implementation for querying Azure resource data. It defines data classes, methods for data retrieval, and input validation. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code relies entirely on Pulumi's SDK to communicate with Azure, which is an expected and safe practice in infrastructure automation scripts. The warnings at the top indicate generated code, not manually crafted malicious code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be legitimate Pulumi SDK code for managing Azure databases. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It functions as an infrastructure querying utility without any malicious behavior.",
