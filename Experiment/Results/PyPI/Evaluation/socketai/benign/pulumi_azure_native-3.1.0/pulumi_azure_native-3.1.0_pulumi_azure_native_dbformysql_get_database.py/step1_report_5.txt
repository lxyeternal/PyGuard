{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes to retrieve information about a database resource from Azure using Pulumi SDK, primarily for infrastructure as code management.",
  "sources": "Data sources include function parameters such as database_name, resource_group_name, server_name, and internal Pulumi runtime invoke calls to fetch resource details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the Pulumi runtime's invoke and invoke_output functions, which could, in theory, send data over the network or perform API calls. However, these are standard SDK methods and do not exhibit malicious behavior by themselves.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the invoke functions, which call Azure APIs and return data that is encapsulated into GetDatabaseResult objects, then passed to Pulumi outputs or returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The code includes a warning about generated files and standard type checks, with no unusual or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical Pulumi SDK wrapper for Azure resource retrieval. It uses standard practices such as type checking, property decorators, and Pulumi invoke functions. No indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The only network-related activity is the standard API call via Pulumi runtime, which is expected for resource management. The code does not contain any suspicious behaviors such as dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling. The warning at the top indicates it's generated code, which aligns with Pulumi's typical code generation patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard generated Pulumi SDK module for Azure database resource querying with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply wraps Azure API calls for resource data retrieval, with no unusual or suspicious code activities.",
