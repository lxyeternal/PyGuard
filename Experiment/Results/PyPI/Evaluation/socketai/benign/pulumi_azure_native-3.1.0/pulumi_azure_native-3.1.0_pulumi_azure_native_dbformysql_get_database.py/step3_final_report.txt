{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions to retrieve Azure database resource information via Pulumi SDK, functioning as auto-generated resource wrappers for querying resource metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as database_name, resource_group_name, server_name, and internal Pulumi invoke functions to fetch data from Azure APIs.",
  "sinks": "The code performs API calls through pulumi.runtime.invoke and pulumi.get, which are standard SDK functions; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to Pulumi invoke functions, which query Azure APIs; data flows from these API responses into class instances via pulumi.get and apply functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pulumi SDK wrapper for Azure database resource information retrieval. It performs input validation, uses safe SDK functions, and encapsulates resource data in classes. No malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The code's purpose aligns with infrastructure as code practices, and it does not execute untrusted code or handle sensitive data insecurely. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign, auto-generated nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the straightforwardness and standard patterns used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. It functions as a resource query wrapper for Azure databases. The supply chain security risk is minimal, with no evidence of malicious payloads or vulnerabilities.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
