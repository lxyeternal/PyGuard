{
  "purpose": "This code is an auto-generated Pulumi SDK module designed to retrieve configuration details for an Azure MySQL server, facilitating infrastructure as code management.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Azure REST API responses via Pulumi's invoke functions, specifically fetching configuration properties such as current_value, default_value, allowed_values, etc.",
  "sinks": "The data flows into Pulumi output objects and properties, potentially exposing configuration details like current and default values, which could be sensitive but are intended for configuration management purposes.",
  "flows": "API responses are processed through Pulumi's invoke functions, with data assigned to class properties and returned as output objects, without any external data transmission or malicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code employs standard SDK patterns, with straightforward property getters and API calls. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi SDK module for Azure resource configuration retrieval. It performs type-checked API calls and returns configuration data encapsulated in Pulumi output objects. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident. The data exposed is typical for such SDKs and is consistent with their purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) align with the code's nature. The inherent data exposure is a known aspect of configuration management and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and performs standard SDK functions for Azure resource configuration management. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage. The low risk score reflects the data exposure inherent to configuration retrieval but does not imply a security threat.",
