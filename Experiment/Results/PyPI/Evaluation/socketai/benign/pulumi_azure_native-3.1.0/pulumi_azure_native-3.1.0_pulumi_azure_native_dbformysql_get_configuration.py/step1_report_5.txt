{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes to retrieve and represent configuration data for Azure MySQL servers via Pulumi SDK.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for get_configuration and get_configuration_output functions; internal pulumi.runtime.invoke calls.",
  "sinks": "Return values of get_configuration and get_configuration_output functions; potentially sensitive configuration data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> invoke functions -> internal API calls -> data retrieved -> returned as objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed; standard Pulumi SDK usage; warning comments for generated code.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be auto-generated, standard Pulumi resource handling for Azure MySQL server configurations. It reads configuration data from Azure API via Pulumi's invoke functions, then wraps this data into classes for further use. No external data input beyond parameters, no code injection points, no hidden network calls, or suspicious file operations. No malicious behaviors like data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining detected. Usage of Pulumi's API and data handling is consistent with standard patterns. No evidence of obfuscation, suspicious code flow, or anomalous behavior found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Pulumi SDK wrapper for Azure resource configuration retrieval. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe, standard generated code for infrastructure as code workflows.",
