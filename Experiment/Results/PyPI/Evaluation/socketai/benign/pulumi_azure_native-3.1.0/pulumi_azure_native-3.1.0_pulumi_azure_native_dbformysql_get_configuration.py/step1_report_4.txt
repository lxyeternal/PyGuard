{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions and classes to retrieve configuration data from Azure MySQL servers via Pulumi, a cloud infrastructure as code tool.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions: configuration_name, resource_group_name, server_name; Data retrieved via pulumi.runtime.invoke and pulumi.runtime.invoke_output functions.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from pulumi.get() calls; Potentially sensitive configuration data such as current_value, default_value, allowed_values, and system_data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into get_configuration and get_configuration_output functions, which invoke Azure APIs, retrieve configuration data, and return structured results, with data flowing from external API responses into the returned objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Use of pulumi.runtime.invoke suggests reliance on Pulumi's SDK mechanisms. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as an SDK wrapper to fetch configuration data from Azure resources. It defines data classes with validation, uses standard Pulumi invocation methods, and has no suspicious or malicious logic. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage beyond what is necessary for API calls, or any backdoors. The code's structure and logic are consistent with legitimate Pulumi provider code. No hidden network activity, system modifications, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, legitimate Pulumi SDK implementation for retrieving Azure MySQL server configurations. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The only potential concern is the exposure of configuration data, but this is inherent to its purpose and is not malicious.",
