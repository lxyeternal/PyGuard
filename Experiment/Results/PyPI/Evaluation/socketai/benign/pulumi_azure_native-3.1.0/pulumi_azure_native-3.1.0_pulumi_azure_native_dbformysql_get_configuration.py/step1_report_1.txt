{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to retrieve and represent configuration information for an Azure Database for MySQL server using Pulumi's infrastructure as code framework.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions: configuration_name, resource_group_name, server_name, and internal data retrieval via pulumi.runtime.invoke methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points are the return of configuration details, including possibly sensitive information like current_value, default_value, and allowed_values, through Pulumi outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to internal Pulumi invoke functions, which fetch data from Azure APIs; retrieved data flows into Pulumi resource property assignments and output constructs, exposing configuration details.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obfuscated code, hidden functions, or unusual language features. The code appears straightforward, with typical Pulumi SDK patterns and type checks. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. All imports and functions serve standard configuration retrieval purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Pulumi patterns to fetch and represent Azure resource configurations, including type safety checks and property accessors. It employs Pulumi's invoke and output mechanisms securely without any apparent malicious behavior. The retrieval of configuration data is typical for infrastructure management. No suspicious network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a legitimate resource configuration accessor, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Pulumi SDK module for retrieving Azure Database for MySQL configuration data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It performs standard infrastructure-as-code tasks securely and transparently.",
