  "purpose": "Utility module for Pulumi-based Python infrastructure as code, providing version handling, environment variable access, dynamic imports, resource registration, and function decorators.",
  "sources": [
    "os.getenv() calls in get_env, get_env_bool, get_env_int, get_env_float",
    "importlib.metadata.version() in _get_semver_version",
    "importlib.util.find_spec() and importlib.util.module_from_spec() in lazy_import functions",
    "pulumi.runtime.call() in call_plain",
    "pulumi.runtime.register_resource_package() and register_resource_module() in register"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "pulumi.runtime.call() with user-provided arguments",
    "dynamic import of modules via lazy_import()",
    "usage of environment variables for configuration"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Environment variables retrieved and converted in get_env_* functions",
    "Version info fetched and converted in _get_semver_version",
    "Resource and module registration flow in register()",
    "call_plain() wraps pulumi.runtime.call and awaits output, exposing resource data"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present",
    "No network connections or data exfiltration observed",
    "No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution present",
    "Use of dynamic import functions is controlled but should be reviewed to ensure no malicious modules are loaded"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for versioning, environment variable access, dynamic module import, and resource registration within a Pulumi Python SDK context. It does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications that could indicate malicious intent. The dynamic import functions rely on sys.modules and importlib.util for module loading, which are standard for plugin architectures but should be verified for safe modules only. The environment variable functions parse and convert user-supplied inputs but do not store or transmit them directly. The registration functions interface with Pulumi SDK to register resources and modules, which is typical for infrastructure code. Overall, no suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility library for Pulumi infrastructure management, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. Its dynamic import functions should be monitored to ensure only trusted modules are loaded, but no malicious intent is detected based on this analysis.",
