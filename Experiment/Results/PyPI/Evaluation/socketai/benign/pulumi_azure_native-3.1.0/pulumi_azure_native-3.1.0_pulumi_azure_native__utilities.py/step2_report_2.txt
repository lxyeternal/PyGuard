  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for Pulumi, with no direct malicious activity. The main concern is the lazy import potentially loading malicious modules if module names are controlled by an attacker.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Justification:** The report correctly notes that dynamic import functions could be misused if attacker-controlled module names are supplied. The overall code is standard and safe, but the potential for malicious module loading justifies a slight risk score.\n- **Verdict:** The score of 0.2 for security risk seems reasonable. Malware score is 0, as no malicious code is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard utility functions, no malicious behavior, but noting the dynamic import as a potential risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No malware, no obfuscation, and the risk is primarily from dynamic imports if inputs are malicious.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, utility functions for Pulumi, with no malicious intent. The only concern is dynamic module loading if inputs are malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower risk score (0.1) is justified given the potential misuse of dynamic imports, but no actual malicious activity is detected.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for Pulumi, with no malicious activity. No secrets or backdoors, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Justification:** No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior identified. The code is straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** Correct scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard utility code with no malicious intent. The only caveat is the dynamic import mechanism.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Justification:** The risk score reflects potential misuse if untrusted module names are supplied, which is reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified given no malicious code or behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the potential risk of dynamic module loading if inputs are malicious. This is a reasonable assessment.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- The main concern is the dynamic import functions (`lazy_import`) which could be exploited if module names are controlled by an attacker. However, in typical controlled environments, this is a standard pattern.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation is present.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (potential misuse of dynamic imports if inputs are malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard utility module for Pulumi with minimal security concerns, primarily related to the potential misuse of dynamic module loading, which is a known pattern in plugin systems but should be used cautiously with untrusted inputs.",
