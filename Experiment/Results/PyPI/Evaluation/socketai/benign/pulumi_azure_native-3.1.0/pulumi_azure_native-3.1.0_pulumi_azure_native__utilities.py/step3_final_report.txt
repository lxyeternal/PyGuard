  "purpose": "Utility functions for Pulumi, including version handling, environment variable access, lazy module import, resource registration, and decorators.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, importlib.metadata for version info, JSON inputs for resource registration, dynamic module names for lazy_import.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import via lazy_import could load malicious modules if module names are untrusted; resource registration functions could be misused if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "get_env functions read environment variables; lazy_import loads modules based on string names; register functions load resource modules and packages from JSON data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import functions (lazy_import) based on string inputs; no validation of module names; get_plugin_download_url returns None, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for Pulumi, handling version parsing, environment variables, lazy import, resource registration, and decorators. No malicious code or backdoors are present. The dynamic import functions could be exploited if module names are controlled by an attacker, but in typical trusted environments, this pattern is standard. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential misuse of dynamic imports, which is acknowledged in the risk score. The malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious payloads. The risk score is low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential but not actual threat. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose, with appropriate caution regarding dynamic module loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Pulumi utility module with no malicious behavior. The primary security consideration is the use of dynamic import functions, which should be used cautiously with trusted inputs. The assigned scores (malware=0, risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
