  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for Pulumi, with no malicious behavior. Dynamic import functions could load malicious modules if module names are controlled by an attacker.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard, and the potential risk stems from dynamic module loading if inputs are malicious, which is correctly acknowledged. The malware score is 0, which is appropriate given no malicious code is present.\n- **Verdict:** **Scores are reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard utility functions, with cautious mention of dynamic import risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report. No malicious code is evident. The low security risk score reflects cautiousness about dynamic imports.\n- **Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—utility functions, version handling, dynamic imports, no malicious behavior. The only concern is potential misuse if JSON inputs are malicious, which is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is safe but notes the risk of malicious inputs in dynamic imports.\n- **Verdict:** **Scores are justified.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for Pulumi, no malicious intent. Emphasizes standard practices and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No malware or security concerns.\n- **Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, highlighting safe utility functions and cautious about dynamic module loading.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.2, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate given the context. No malicious code detected.\n- **Verdict:** **Scores are justified.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all cases, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to dynamic imports and environment variable handling, which are standard but can be exploited if inputs are malicious. The scores of 0.1 or 0.2 are reasonable.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is standard utility code for Pulumi, with no malicious behavior.\n- The main security concern is dynamic module loading, which is correctly acknowledged.\n- The scores reflect a cautious but justified stance.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — standard caution due to dynamic imports and environment variables, but no actual exploit or malicious activity detected.\n\n**Summary:** The reports' scores are reasonable and justified based on the code review. No adjustments are necessary.",
