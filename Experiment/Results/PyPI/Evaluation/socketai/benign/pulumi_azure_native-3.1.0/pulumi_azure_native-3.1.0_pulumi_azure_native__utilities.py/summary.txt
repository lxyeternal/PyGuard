  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Pulumi utility module with no malicious behavior. The primary security consideration is the use of dynamic import functions, which should be used cautiously with trusted inputs. The assigned scores (malware=0, risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
