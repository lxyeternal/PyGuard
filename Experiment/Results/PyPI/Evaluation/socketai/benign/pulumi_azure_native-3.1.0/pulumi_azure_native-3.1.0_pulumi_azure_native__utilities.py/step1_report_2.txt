{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for managing environment variables, versioning, resource registration, and interaction with the Pulumi SDK, mainly facilitating resource and module construction for Pulumi-based infrastructure as code.",
  "sources": "Environment variable functions (get_env, get_env_bool, get_env_int, get_env_float), importlib.metadata for version info, and the lazy_import function which dynamically imports modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks, no network operations, no file writes, no use of untrusted inputs in security-sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read through get_env functions; version info is obtained from importlib.metadata; lazy_import dynamically imports modules; resource construction uses imported modules and specified resource info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code warns against manual editing and imports multiple modules without apparent malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility operations: environment variable retrieval, version parsing and conversion, dynamic module import, resource registration with Pulumi, and decorator creation. All functions use conventional Python practices, with no indication of malicious intent. The lazy_import function could potentially load untrusted modules if module names are derived externally, but in typical usage, module names are predefined and controlled. There are no network calls, no data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors. The code's structure and comments indicate it is intended for infrastructure automation and version management within a Pulumi-based project.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility module designed for Pulumi infrastructure management. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of dynamic module import warrants standard caution, but within expected usage scenarios, it does not pose a security threat.",
