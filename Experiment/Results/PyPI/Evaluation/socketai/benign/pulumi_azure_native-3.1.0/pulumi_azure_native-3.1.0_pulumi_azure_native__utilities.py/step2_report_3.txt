  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence or absence of issues, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions/classes for Pulumi, version handling, resource registration, environment variables, lazy imports.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, standard practices, dynamic import could be risky if inputs are malicious, but no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is primarily utility and registration logic, with potential risk stemming from dynamic module loading if inputs are malicious. No malware is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for environment variables, version info, lazy import, resource registration.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard Python practices, cautious about dynamic import but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is safe, with standard practices. Dynamic import could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but no malicious behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for Pulumi resource management, versioning, environment variables, lazy import, registration.\n- **Findings:** No secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. Dynamic import is a potential risk if JSON inputs are malicious, but this is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. The code is typical SDK utility code, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for Pulumi, version, environment, dynamic import, decorators.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no secrets, no network activity, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for Pulumi, version, environment, dynamic import, registration.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard practices, dynamic import should be monitored but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. The code is a typical utility module with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:**  \n  All reports agree that no malware is present. The code does not contain any payloads, backdoors, or malicious API calls.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  No obfuscated code is present; the code is clear and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk Scores:**  \n  The primary concern is dynamic module loading via `lazy_import`. If an attacker controls the module names or JSON inputs, malicious modules could be loaded. However, this is a common pattern in plugin systems and not inherently malicious. The scores reflect this, with a low risk (0.1–0.2).\n\n- **Malware Scores:**  \n  All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, consistent with the code's content.\n\n- **Assumptions & Potential Vulnerabilities:**  \n  The reports rightly note that if inputs to `lazy_import` or JSON parameters are malicious, there could be security issues. But the code itself does not perform malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (No malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (Code is clear, no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1–0.2** (Potential risk if external inputs are malicious, but standard in plugin systems)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard utility module for Pulumi, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of dynamic imports, which should be controlled or validated in deployment environments, but this is a common pattern and not inherently dangerous.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (to account for potential misuse of dynamic import if inputs are malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and typical for its purpose. No malicious activity is evident, and the risk scores are appropriately low given the context.",
