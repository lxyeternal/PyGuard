{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and class definitions for Pulumi resource management in Python, including version handling, environment variable access, lazy module importing, and resource registration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via get_env, get_env_bool, get_env_int, get_env_float; importlib.metadata for version info; lazy_import function for dynamic module loading; JSON input for resource registration.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions appear to directly process untrusted data into critical system commands or insecure APIs; resource registration and dynamic imports are controlled via explicit parameters or pre-defined JSON structures.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to influence configuration; resource registration functions process JSON data to instantiate resource modules and packages; lazy_import dynamically loads modules based on string identifiers; resource construction uses specified class names from lazy modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors detected. Use of dynamic module loading via string identifiers could be risky if input JSON is malicious, but in this context, it appears controlled. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present. The code comments warn against manual editing, indicating generated code, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages resource versioning, environment variables, and dynamic resource registration for Pulumi. It uses safe import mechanisms and version parsing. No evident malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The dynamic import functions could be exploited if the JSON inputs are malicious, but this is a standard pattern in plugin systems and relies on trusted inputs. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious obfuscated code, or malicious API calls are present. The code includes proper warnings about manual edits and version management, indicating it's a generated and maintained SDK component.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for Pulumi with no malicious intent or malicious behavior. Its use of dynamic imports warrants caution if JSON inputs are untrusted, but in typical usage, it is safe. There are no signs of malware, secret leakage, or security risks within this code fragment.",
