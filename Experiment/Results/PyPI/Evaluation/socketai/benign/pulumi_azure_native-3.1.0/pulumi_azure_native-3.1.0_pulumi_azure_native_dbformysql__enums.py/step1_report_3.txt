{
  "purpose": "The code defines various enumerations for configuration options related to server setup, security, and management within an Azure environment, generated by Pulumi for infrastructure as code.",
  "sources": "The code sources are mostly static class definitions and string constants; no external input or data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines enums and constants used for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate for configuration options.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions, with descriptive docstrings and fixed string values. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or data processing mechanisms. The structure is straightforward and consistent with auto-generated configuration code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code’s comments warn against manual editing, indicating it’s a generated configuration file rather than malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, auto-generated configuration code defining enums for Azure server setup options. There is no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment.",
