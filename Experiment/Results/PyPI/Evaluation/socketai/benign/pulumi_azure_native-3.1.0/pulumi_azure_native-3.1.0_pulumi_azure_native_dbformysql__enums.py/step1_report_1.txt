{
  "purpose": "This code defines various enumerations for configuring a server or service, likely related to Azure or a similar cloud environment, including settings for encryption, networking, versioning, and scalability.",
  "sources": "The code sources are enumeration class definitions, constants, and comments. No external input reading or data ingestion occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only establishes static enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a warning comment about being generated by Pulumi, a legitimate infrastructure as code tool. No suspicious or obfuscated code features are present. The enums are standard and descriptive; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of enum definitions with descriptive comments, typical for configuration schemas in SDKs or APIs. The presence of a warning about auto-generation suggests it is part of a generated SDK or configuration package. No suspicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code is detected. The code is straightforward and only defines static constants, with no dynamic execution or external input handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, auto-generated set of configuration enums for managing server settings. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks within this code. It serves as a static configuration schema without dynamic or harmful elements.",
