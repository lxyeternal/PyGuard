  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as auto-generated enum definitions for Azure or similar cloud configurations.\n- No external data sources, dynamic code, or executable logic are present.\n- The comments explicitly warn against manual editing, indicating generated boilerplate code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected across all reports.\n- The code is purely declarative, defining static constants for configuration purposes.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not include any data flows, sinks, or inputs that could be exploited.\n- There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs.\n- The presence of comments about auto-generation and the lack of any suspicious features strongly suggest benign intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated: 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward enum definitions.\n- Security risk: 0, as the code is static configuration data without any executable or exploitable elements.\n- The reasoning and conclusions in all reports are sound and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments that this is a benign, auto-generated configuration module with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- Obfuscated score: **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- Risk score: **0** (no security risk or vulnerabilities evident)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code appears to be a standard part of an SDK or infrastructure-as-code setup, serving as static configuration enums. No further action or concern is warranted.",
