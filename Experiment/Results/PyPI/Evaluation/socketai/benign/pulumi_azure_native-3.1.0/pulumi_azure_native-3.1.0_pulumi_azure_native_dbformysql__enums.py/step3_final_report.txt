{
  "purpose": "Defines static enumeration classes for server and security configuration parameters, auto-generated by Pulumi for infrastructure setup.",
  "sources": "Static enum class definitions with string values, no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static definitions serve as configuration constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-commented, and auto-generated with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enum class definitions with descriptive comments, indicating auto-generation by Pulumi. No dynamic code, external data handling, or executable logic is present. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The comments and structure confirm the benign, configuration schema purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's static, declarative nature. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated set of configuration enums for cloud resource management, with no malicious or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe supply chain component.",
