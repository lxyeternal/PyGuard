  "purpose": "This code defines multiple enumeration classes for configuring and managing Azure database server properties.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines static classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external input or untrusted data; the code only sets up static configurations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely declarative, with no dynamic or executable logic, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. Comments indicate auto-generation, no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script contains multiple enum class definitions used for server configuration. It includes comments indicating auto-generation, and there are no dynamic data handling, external inputs, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual language features are present. The code appears to be a configuration schema for Azure resource management, with clear, descriptive class and enum names. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated configuration module defining enums for server setup. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard and intended for configuration purposes only.",
