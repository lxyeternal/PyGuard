  "purpose": "Define Pulumi resource classes for managing Azure SQL server firewall rules.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for IP addresses, resource group name, server name, and firewall rule name; reading from input objects and resource options.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted IP address inputs used directly in resource creation, but no code injection or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters into resource properties; no untrusted data flows to network or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. The code primarily defines classes and constructors with validation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for Pulumi resource types with constructors, property accessors, and resource retrieval methods. It performs input validation and merges resource options. There are no signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or data exfiltration. Usage of Pulumi API for resource management is standard. No obfuscated code, suspicious function calls, or external network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Pulumi resource class definition for managing Azure SQL firewall rules. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily handles resource parameters and validation with no signs of malware or security threats.",
