{
  "purpose": "Defines Pulumi resource types for managing Azure MySQL and SQL firewall rules, including argument classes and resource classes with constructors and property accessors.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as IP addresses, resource group name, server name, and optional firewall rule name used during resource creation and retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from input parameters into resource properties; no external data leaks, network transmissions, or malicious data exfiltration are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to resource properties during initialization; no external or untrusted data flows beyond resource configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is auto-generated and follows standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of auto-generated Pulumi classes for Azure firewall rules, with constructors, property getters/setters, and resource retrieval methods. No malicious or suspicious logic is present. The data flow is typical for infrastructure as code, with parameters used solely for resource configuration. No obfuscation, network activity, or malicious payloads are detected. The code's purpose is to manage cloud resources safely and transparently.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi resource definition for managing Azure MySQL and SQL firewall rules. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the data flow is typical for infrastructure configuration. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
