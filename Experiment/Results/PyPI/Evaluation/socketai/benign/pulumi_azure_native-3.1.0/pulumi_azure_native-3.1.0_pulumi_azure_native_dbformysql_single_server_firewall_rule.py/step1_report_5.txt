{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for managing Azure database server firewall rules using Pulumi infrastructure as code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters for IP addresses, resource group names, server names, and optional firewall rule names. It also retrieves resource properties such as API version, resource type, and name.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is executed or directly leaks outside. The code primarily sets and gets resource properties without executing external commands or handling sensitive data directly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (IP addresses, resource info) are assigned to resource properties. These properties are used for resource creation or retrieval without further processing. No direct flow from untrusted input to insecure operations is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears to be boilerplate for resource definition, with standard property handling and resource management patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi resource class implementation for managing Azure firewall rules. It includes input argument classes, resource class constructors, property accessors, and get methods for existing resources. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or obfuscation is evident. It relies on Pulumi's SDK for resource management and does not execute untrusted code or external commands. The comments and structure align with normal IaC patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Pulumi resource definition for Azure firewall rules, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It handles input parameters and resource properties in a typical manner. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
