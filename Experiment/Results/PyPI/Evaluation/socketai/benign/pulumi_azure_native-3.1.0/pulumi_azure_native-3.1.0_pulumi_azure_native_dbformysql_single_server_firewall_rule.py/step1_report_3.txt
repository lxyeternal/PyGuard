{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for managing Azure MySQL server firewall rules using Pulumi infrastructure as code framework.",
  "sources": "Imports Pulumi SDK, standard libraries, and internal utilities. Data sources include class constructors, property getters, and resource initialization functions.",
  "fires": "Potentially sensitive data could originate from user input parameters like end_ip_address, start_ip_address, resource_group_name, server_name, firewall_rule_name, or resource ID for lookups.",
  "flows": "User inputs and resource arguments flow into resource property initializations, class constructors, and property getters; untrusted data could reach resource creation or state retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No unusual or obfuscated code segments. No network operations or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data classes and resource management for Azure firewall rules, utilizing standard Pulumi patterns. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or cryptic code constructs are present. The resource arguments are passed carefully with validation for required fields. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious behaviors are detected. The structure and usage align with typical infrastructure code for resource provisioning.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of Pulumi resource classes for Azure MySQL firewall rules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions as intended for managing infrastructure components without exposing vulnerabilities.",
