{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes to retrieve Azure Active Directory administrator information for a MySQL server resource via Pulumi's SDK.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: administrator_name, resource_group_name, server_name; Pulumi runtime.invoke and invoke_output functions that fetch data from Azure API.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from API calls via pulumi.runtime.invoke and invoke_output; data used within the Pulumi SDK, not directly exposed externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to form arguments for API calls (sources) which are executed by pulumi.runtime.invoke/invoke_output (sinks). Retrieved data flows into Pulumi result objects for further processing or deployment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is standard Pulumi SDK usage for resource data fetching. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi SDK implementation for retrieving resource data from Azure. It defines result classes with type checks, API call functions with parameter validation, and uses Pulumi's invoke mechanism to fetch data. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling. The functions and classes are straightforward wrappers around Azure API calls, with standard safety checks and type enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate SDK implementation for retrieving Azure AD administrator info, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply fetches data from Azure API and structures it within Pulumi's framework.",
