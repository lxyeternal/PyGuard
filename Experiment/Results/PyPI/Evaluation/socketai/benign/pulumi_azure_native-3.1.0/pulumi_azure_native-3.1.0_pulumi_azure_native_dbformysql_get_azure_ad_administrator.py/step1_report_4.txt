{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes to retrieve Azure AD administrator information via Pulumi, an infrastructure as code tool, for use in managing cloud resources.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: administrator_name, resource_group_name, server_name; Data retrieval via pulumi.runtime.invoke and invoke_output functions.",
  "sinks": "The invoke functions send requests to Azure APIs, but do not process untrusted data into sensitive operations; no direct data sinks like file writes or network transmissions of data are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct invocation arguments; data flows from these inputs to API calls, and responses flow back into Pulumi objects and outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code is well-structured and typical for Pulumi Azure SDK usage.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes with validation, and functions that call Azure APIs through Pulumi's invoke mechanisms. It performs input validation and structured API calls without executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data insecurely. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. It is a standard SDK code pattern for resource information retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate SDK utility code for interacting with Azure resources via Pulumi, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely validates inputs and utilizes Pulumi's API mechanisms appropriately.",
