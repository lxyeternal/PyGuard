{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi resource types and functions to retrieve Azure Active Directory administrator information for a MySQL server using Azure REST API.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: administrator_name, resource_group_name, server_name. Data retrieval via pulumi.runtime.invoke and pulumi.runtime.invoke_output.",
  "sinks": "Return values are constructed into Pulumi output types, not directly influencing system state or executing untrusted code. No external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into invoke calls; responses are processed and mapped to output objects; no data flows into untrusted external systems or commands.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for Pulumi resource definitions; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of resource class definitions with type checks, property accessors, and functions that wrap Pulumi API calls. All parameters are validated for type correctness. The functions invoke Azure REST API versions, process responses, and produce Pulumi output objects. No indications of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pulumi SDK resource definition and API invocation wrapper for retrieving Azure AD administrator information. It performs data retrieval securely, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
