  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward Pulumi SDK implementation for retrieving Azure AD administrator info. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the analysis. The malware score of 0 is justified, as no malicious activity is detected. The confidence level (0.9) is high, and the code appears benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard Pulumi resource definition and API invocation wrapper. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code performs data retrieval securely without suspicious behavior. The risk score remains low, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard resource data retrieval code with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The absence of any suspicious activity justifies a zero risk score. Malware remains at 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Continues the pattern of standard SDK code for resource info retrieval, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score and malware score are justified, given the code's nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as previous reports—standard Pulumi code for fetching Azure resource info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) compared to others, but still very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports have malware=0, which is consistent. The code is purely for resource data retrieval, with no signs of malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the analysis, the risk scores are appropriately low, as the code performs standard API calls without malicious intent.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic.\n- It uses Pulumi's SDK mechanisms properly, with input validation and safe API calls.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious data exfiltration, or code injection.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain very low, ideally around 0.1 for all, since the code is standard SDK usage with no malicious intent.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate in their assessments.** No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, standard Pulumi SDK resource retrieval code.\n- Scores are justified and consistent.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n**Final Malware Score:** 0  \n**Final Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Final Risk Score:** 0.1 (or slightly higher, but 0.1 is appropriate)",
