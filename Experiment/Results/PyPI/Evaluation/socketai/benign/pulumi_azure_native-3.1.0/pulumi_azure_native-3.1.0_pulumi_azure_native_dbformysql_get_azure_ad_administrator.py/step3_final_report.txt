{
  "purpose": "The code implements Pulumi SDK functions to retrieve Azure AD administrator information via API calls, serving as a resource data fetcher within infrastructure as code workflows.",
  "sources": "API responses from Azure via Pulumi invoke functions, with input parameters for resource identification.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from API responses into Pulumi resource objects; no external or malicious data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "API responses are processed and mapped into Pulumi resource result objects; no untrusted data is used in sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are present; code is straightforward SDK usage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard resource data retrieval using Pulumi SDK functions with type validation. It contains no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. The API calls are typical for infrastructure resource querying. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The code's structure and behavior align with benign SDK utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Pulumi SDK implementation for fetching Azure AD administrator info. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's benign purpose.",
