  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code details with the report summaries, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a Pulumi SDK implementation for retrieving Azure AD administrator info, with standard type checks, API calls, and no malicious signs.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It performs expected API interactions, with proper validation and data encapsulation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low). These seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The minimal risk score reflects the benign purpose—data retrieval with no security implications.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SDK usage, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1, the code is typical for Pulumi resource fetching. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. These are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the code's purpose—safe data retrieval.\n\n**Conclusion:** No concerns; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard Pulumi SDK code for resource info retrieval, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with previous reports—no obfuscation, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 or 0.1. Given the consistent pattern, a risk of 0.1 remains appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No security risks are evident; the low score is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard resource info fetching with no malicious indicators.\n- **Assessment:** The code is typical SDK code, with proper validation and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. These are suitable.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** No concerns; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Slightly higher but still low, possibly reflecting minimal inherent risk in data retrieval code.\n- **Justification:** No active threats or malicious patterns detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's purpose as a resource data fetcher in Pulumi SDK.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports, as the code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard SDK patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, reflecting the nature of the code as a safe SDK utility with no security implications.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — No signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — Clear, standard SDK code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Minimal risk, inherent to data retrieval code, but no security concerns.\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard Pulumi SDK implementation for retrieving Azure AD administrator information. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores are justified, and overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
