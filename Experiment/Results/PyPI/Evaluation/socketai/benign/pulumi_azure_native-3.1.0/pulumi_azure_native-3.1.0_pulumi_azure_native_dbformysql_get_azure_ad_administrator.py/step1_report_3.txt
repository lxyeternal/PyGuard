{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes to retrieve information about Azure AD administrators for a MySQL server via Pulumi's SDK, primarily for infrastructure management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (administrator_name, resource_group_name, server_name), configuration options (opts), and internal Pulumi invocation data.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from Pulumi's invoke functions and properties within the classes, such as 'id', 'login', 'tenant_id', etc., which are generally used internally or exposed via APIs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into Pulumi invoke calls; the responses from these calls flow into class instances and properties, which are used by the user or other infrastructure code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. The code mainly consists of type checks, data retrieval, and property definitions. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external network activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pulumi SDK implementation for resource data retrieval. It performs type validation on input parameters, calls Pulumi's runtime.invoke or invoke_output to fetch resource data, and exposes this data through class properties. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code adheres to typical SDK patterns and is purely informational with no active data exfiltration, code injection, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, standard SDK component for retrieving Azure AD administrator details in a Pulumi-managed infrastructure. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
