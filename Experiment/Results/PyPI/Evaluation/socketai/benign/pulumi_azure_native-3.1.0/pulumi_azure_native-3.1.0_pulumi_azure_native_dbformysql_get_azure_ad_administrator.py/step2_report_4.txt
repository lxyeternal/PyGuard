  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its purpose, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code fetches Azure AD administrator info via Pulumi SDK, using standard API calls.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward SDK usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate SDK code, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is standard, and no malicious behavior is evident. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard resource info retrieval.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid SDK code, very high confidence (1). Malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The security risk score is reasonable, considering the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, fetching resource info.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious indicators or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, standard SDK code, high confidence (1). Malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues with the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as prior, resource info retrieval.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate SDK code, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard SDK code, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores seem consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** None detected. All reports correctly identify the code as SDK resource retrieval functions.\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the code's nature. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal risk of this SDK code being malicious.\n- **Risk Scores (>0.5):** None are above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurately reflect the benign nature of the code. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard Pulumi SDK implementation for resource info retrieval, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores across reports are appropriate, and I concur with their assessments.",
