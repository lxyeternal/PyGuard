{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes to retrieve Azure AD administrator information for a MySQL server using Pulumi infrastructure as code framework.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in functions (administrator_name, resource_group_name, server_name), Pulumi runtime invoke calls to fetch data.",
  "sinks": "Pulumi invoke calls that fetch data from Azure APIs; data returned is processed into Pulumi output types.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into Pulumi invoke calls which retrieve data from Azure API; retrieved data flows into result objects and output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No suspicious network calls, obfuscated code, or hidden logic detected. The code mainly calls official Azure APIs via Pulumi.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes with type checks, functions to invoke Azure API calls using Pulumi, and handles data securely. It employs standard practices for Pulumi SDK interactions. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity, is present. All data handling appears to be standard for resource management and info retrieval. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic are present. The code relies on Pulumi's SDK and Azure's official API endpoints, indicating normal operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pulumi provider implementation for Azure resource info retrieval with no malicious intent detected. It appears safe and primarily serves to fetch Azure resource data securely.",
