{
  "purpose": "This script updates version numbers and related metadata across multiple project files and formats, including XML, CMake, Python, Java, and others, for a software release process.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments, reading and parsing various configuration and source files (XML, text, code headers).",
  "sinks": "File write operations that overwrite project files and generate new version info; no direct data leaks or external system interactions detected.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are processed to determine new version info, which is then propagated through file rewriting functions to update version references in source files and build scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The script performs standard file parsing and rewriting without obfuscated logic or hidden behavior. No network activity, system calls, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads user input, validates version format, and updates version numbers in multiple project files. It uses regex for text replacements and DOM parsing for XML updates. No suspicious external calls or obfuscated code are present. The logic appears straightforward and aligned with standard release automation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a version updater for various project formats, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs expected file manipulations without external or covert actions.",
