  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports describe the script as a version updater that modifies project files via regex and XML parsing.\n- The code performs straightforward operations: reading input, validating, regex substitutions, XML DOM modifications, and writing back to files.\n- No report mentions or shows evidence of code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate: they all describe the script as a benign, multi-format version updater.\n- No report points out any vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The code does not seem to have logical flaws that could lead to security issues; it is a standard build script.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0.\n- These scores are reasonable given the analysis; the script is purely for version management.\n- No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- The highest risk score is 0, indicating no security concern.\n- The script does not perform any dangerous operations, such as executing untrusted code, network calls, or handling secrets.\n- Therefore, the risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**Step 5: Examine malware score**\n\n- Malware score is 0 in all reports.\n- The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The malware score is justified as zero.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- All reports assume the script is solely for version updating.\n- No assumptions about hidden vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made; this is correct.\n- The code's operations are transparent and safe.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency of scores**\n\n- All reports are consistent: no malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.\n- This aligns with the code review.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe script is a standard, multi-format version updater used in release automation. It employs safe file handling, regex replacements, and XML parsing without any malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no external network calls, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. The overall purpose is legitimate, and the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided code is a benign, well-structured version management tool. It poses no security risks or malware concerns based on the detailed review of the code and reports.",
