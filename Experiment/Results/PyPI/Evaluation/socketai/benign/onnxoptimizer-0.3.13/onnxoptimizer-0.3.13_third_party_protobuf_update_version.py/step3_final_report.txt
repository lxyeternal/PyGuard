{
  "purpose": "The code is a multi-language version update script that modifies project files (XML, headers, build scripts, etc.) to set version numbers based on user input, primarily for release automation.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for version info; file reads for XML, headers, and build files.",
  "sinks": "File overwrites with regex and XML modifications; no network or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Input validation and parsing lead to regex and XML-based file modifications, replacing version strings and related metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard version management tasks: validating input, parsing files, applying regex replacements, and updating XML nodes. It does not execute external commands, connect to networks, or handle sensitive data. The code structure is clear, with functions dedicated to specific file types and updates. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The operations are typical for release automation tools, and the scores reflect this benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-built version updater with no malicious intent or security risks. It employs safe file handling, regex, and XML parsing without any suspicious or malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is 0, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
