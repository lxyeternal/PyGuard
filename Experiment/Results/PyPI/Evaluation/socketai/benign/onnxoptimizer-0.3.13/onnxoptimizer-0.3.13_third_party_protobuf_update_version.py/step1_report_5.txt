{
  "purpose": "This script automates updating version numbers and related configuration files across multiple programming language environments and build systems for a software project.",
  "sources": "User-provided command-line arguments for version input; file reads from various configuration, script, and project files; datetime module for timestamping.",
  "sinks": "File write operations (open with 'wb' or 'w'), replacing text in files, creating or modifying project configuration files and source code files.",
  "flows": "Input version arguments → processing and validation → functions generating new version strings → rewriting configuration and source files with updated version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity. Use of regex for replacing version strings is standard. No obfuscated or misleading code present.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies input arguments, processes version info, and updates multiple configuration files and source code files across different languages. It employs standard file I/O and regex operations for text replacement, with no indication of data leaks, code injection, or malicious activity. The only potential concern is the unrestricted file modifications, but this aligns with its intended purpose of version management. No external network calls or sensitive data handling are observed. The code is well-structured and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build and version update tool with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs expected file manipulations based on user input for versioning purposes. No security risks or suspicious actions are detected.",
