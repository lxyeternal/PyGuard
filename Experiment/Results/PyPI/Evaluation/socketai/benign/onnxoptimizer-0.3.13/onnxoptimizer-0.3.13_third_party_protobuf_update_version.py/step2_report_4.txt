  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Legitimate version update across multiple files.\n- Sources: Command-line args, file reads.\n- Sinks: Writes to files, no network or dangerous commands.\n- Flows: Straightforward argument parsing and regex-based file modifications.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Clear, safe, purpose aligned with build/release automation.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard version update tasks.\n- No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- No external interactions.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe, straightforward script.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: version updates, file modifications, regex replacements.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n- No external network or code injection.\n- Purpose aligns with release automation.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with previous reports, focusing on version consistency.\n- No malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- Clear, deterministic file updates.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: legitimate version management.\n- No suspicious activity, network calls, or obfuscation.\n- Well-structured, purpose-specific.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity—no network calls, no code injection, no backdoors, no suspicious behavior.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured.  \n**Risk Score:** Given the above, the overall security risk is minimal, primarily because the script manipulates files for versioning, a common and benign task.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\nThe reports are consistent in their assessment. They all recognize the script as a standard, safe build/release automation tool. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**The overall security assessment should be:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
