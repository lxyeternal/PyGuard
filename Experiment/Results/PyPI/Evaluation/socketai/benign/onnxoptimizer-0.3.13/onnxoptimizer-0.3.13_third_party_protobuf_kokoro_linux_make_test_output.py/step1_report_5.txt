  "purpose": "The script gathers test output logs and creates an XML report in JUnit format for Jenkins.",
  "sources": "Reading from files: 'joblog', 'logs/1/.../stdout', 'logs/1/.../stderr', and 'logs/1/cpp/build_time'; also reading directory listings with os.listdir.",
  "sinks": "Printing XML output to stdout; writing debug info to stderr.",
  "flows": "Reads test logs and stdout/stderr files, processes data into a structured format, then generates XML report and outputs it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic present. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code reads test logs and related output files to compile a structured test report. It processes file data securely, with no evident malicious logic. Uses standard libraries and straightforward file handling. No untrusted input is used in dangerous operations; the flow is simple and predictable. No obfuscation or unusual language features observed. No hidden backdoors, no data exfiltration mechanisms, and no suspicious code injection points are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard test report generator that processes logs and produces an XML report for Jenkins. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and focused solely on its intended purpose.",
