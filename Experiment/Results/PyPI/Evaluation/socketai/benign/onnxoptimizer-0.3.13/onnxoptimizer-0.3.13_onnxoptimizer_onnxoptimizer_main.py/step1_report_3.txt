{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for optimizing ONNX models using the onnxoptimizer library, allowing users to select optimization passes and save the optimized model.",
  "sources": "The code reads input model files specified via command-line arguments and uses standard Python modules (argparse, sys, pathlib). It also reads and loads ONNX model files via onnx.load().",
  "sinks": "The code writes the optimized ONNX model to an output file specified via command-line arguments. The onnx.save() function is used to save the model, with a fallback option to save as external data.",
  "flows": "Input file path from command-line → onnx.load() loads the model → optimization passes applied → onnx.save() writes output model file",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code performs standard argument parsing, file existence checking, model loading, optimization, and saving. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard command-line argument parsing to select optimization passes and files. It includes basic input validation, such as file existence checks. The onnx.load() and onnx.save() functions are used in a typical manner. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network communication, credential handling, or code injection. The only potential concern is fallback to save_as_external_data, which is a documented feature of ONNX to handle large models, not malicious. The code comments and structure are straightforward and align with expected use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate tool for optimizing ONNX models. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It simply processes model files using established libraries. The overall security risk is minimal.",
