  "purpose": "The script runs static type checking using mypy on the current project directory and its parent directory.",
  "sources": "Reads the current script's file path (__file__), computes its parent directories, and sets the working directory accordingly.",
  "sinks": "Executes mypy commands via subprocess, which could potentially execute malicious code if mypy or related scripts are compromised, but normally this is safe.",
  "flows": "Gets the directory path -> changes working directory -> runs mypy checks on the directory -> handles exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The use of subprocess for running mypy is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the project root directory relative to the script location and changes the working directory to that root. It then runs mypy twice: once for Python 3 code and once for Python 2 compatibility, using subprocess.check_call. Exception handling prevents traceback clutter. No untrusted input handling or data exfiltration is present. The code's purpose is to perform type checks, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script safely performs static type checking on a project directory without malicious intent. No security risks or malware are present; the code is straightforward and purpose-driven.",
