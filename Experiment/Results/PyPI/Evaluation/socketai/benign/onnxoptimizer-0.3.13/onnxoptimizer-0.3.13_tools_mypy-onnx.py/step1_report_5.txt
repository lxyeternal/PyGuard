  "purpose": "Run static type checks on the project directory using mypy.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file system to determine the root directory and executes mypy commands.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess calls execute mypy, which is a static type checker; no direct data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Determines root directory -> executes 'mypy' commands -> processes their success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of subprocess and os modules for directory management and command execution.",
  "analysis": "The script computes the project's root directory, changes the working directory there, and runs mypy for type checking in Python 2 and 3 modes. It handles exceptions gracefully to avoid cluttering output. No user input, untrusted data, or suspicious behavior is present. The subprocess calls are standard for type-checking workflows. No malicious or maliciously disguised code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward script for running type checks; no malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
