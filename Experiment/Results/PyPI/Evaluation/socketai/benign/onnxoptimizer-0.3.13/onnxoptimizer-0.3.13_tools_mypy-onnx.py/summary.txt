  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for static type checking with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assess it as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is overly cautious; it could be adjusted to 0. The overall confidence in this assessment is high (1)."
