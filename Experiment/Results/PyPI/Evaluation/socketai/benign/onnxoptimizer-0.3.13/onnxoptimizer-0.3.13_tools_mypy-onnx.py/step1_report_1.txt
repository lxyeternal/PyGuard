{
  "purpose": "The script runs type checks on the project directory using mypy in both Python 3 and Python 2 modes.",
  "sources": "os.path.realpath, os.path.dirname, os.path.abspath, subprocess.check_call, os.chdir",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call (executes mypy commands), os.chdir (changes working directory)",
  "flows": "Retrieves project root path -> Changes directory -> Runs mypy type checks in current directory",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious commands. Uses standard library and common type-checking commands.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the project root directory by resolving the path of the current file's grandparent directory, then changes the working directory to that root. It subsequently runs mypy type checks twice, once normally and once with Python 2 compatibility. The try-except block captures subprocess errors to prevent unhandled exceptions, simply exiting with status 1 if mypy fails. There are no obfuscated parts, suspicious network activity, or malicious commands. The script performs a legitimate build validation task without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a safe, typical project validation step by running static type checks. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script for code quality assurance.",
