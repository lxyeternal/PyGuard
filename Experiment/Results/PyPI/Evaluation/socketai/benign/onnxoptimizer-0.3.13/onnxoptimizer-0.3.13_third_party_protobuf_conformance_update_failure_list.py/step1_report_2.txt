{
  "purpose": "The script manages a failure list file by adding or removing entries based on input files, updating the list accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified by --add and --remove arguments, reads existing failure list file.",
  "sinks": "Writes updated failure list back to the specified filename.",
  "flows": "Reads add/remove input files -> processes lines into sets -> reads existing list -> writes updated list with modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Uses standard file operations and string processing. No suspicious dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file reading and writing, manipulating sets of lines based on user inputs. It ensures no conflicting add/remove lines. No external network connections, no data exfiltration, no code injection mechanisms. Logic is straightforward and related to list management. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code does not process untrusted data in a manner that could lead to security issues beyond normal file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file management script for updating a failure list, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates solely on local files and user input, with no external communication or suspicious code patterns.",
