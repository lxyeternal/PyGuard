  "purpose": "Update a failure list file by adding or removing specified entries based on input files.",
  "sources": "User-provided filenames via command-line arguments; content of add and remove files; the existing failure list file.",
  "sinks": "Reading from input files and the existing failure list file; writing back to the failure list file.",
  "flows": "Input files -> set populations (add_set, remove_set); existing list file -> read into memory; add/remove sets -> write updated list back to the file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; use of exception for conflicting add/remove lines is appropriate; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script processes input files to build sets of lines to add or remove. It raises an exception if a line appears in both add and remove sets, preventing conflicting operations. The existing failure list is read, and the script writes back an updated list, inserting new entries in sorted order. All operations involve file I/O, set management, and string processing, with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. No external network connections or hidden backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward and intended for list management without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward utility for managing a list file by adding and removing entries based on input files. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. Its operations are transparent and limited to file and string processing, with proper handling of potential conflicts.",
