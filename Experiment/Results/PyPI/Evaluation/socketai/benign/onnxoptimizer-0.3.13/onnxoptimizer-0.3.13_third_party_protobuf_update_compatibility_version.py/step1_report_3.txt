{
  "purpose": "The script updates the LAST_RELEASED version in a file named 'tests.sh' based on the provided version input, to check compatibility between software releases.",
  "sources": "Input source: command-line arguments (sys.argv) for version information. File input: 'tests.sh' for reading and updating version data.",
  "sinks": "File write operation: overwriting 'tests.sh' with potentially modified content.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument parsing -> Validation -> File reading -> Line modification -> File rewriting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The script performs straightforward text replacement based on version input. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leaks identified.",
  "analysis": "The script processes command-line arguments to set a version, validates the format, and conditionally exits based on input. It then reads 'tests.sh', searches for a line starting with 'LAST_RELEASED=', and replaces that line with the new version. The code structure is simple, with no obfuscated elements or dynamic code execution. It functions as a version updater, not executing any external or malicious commands, nor handling sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version update script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe file read/write operations and simple regex-based text replacement. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
