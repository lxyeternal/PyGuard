{
  "purpose": "The script updates the 'LAST_RELEASED' version in a shell script file based on user input, primarily for version management.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for version info; reads 'tests.sh' file for updating a specific line.",
  "sinks": "Writes back to 'tests.sh' after modifying the 'LAST_RELEASED' variable; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> Validation -> Read 'tests.sh' -> Line modification -> Write back to 'tests.sh'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious external calls. The script performs straightforward text substitution with user-provided data, which is typical for version updates. No obfuscated code or unusual language features present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles argument validation, parses version info, and updates a specific line in a shell script file. It performs no network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification beyond file editing. No suspicious or malicious logic is detected. It is a simple version update utility with proper input validation. The code flow and structure are clear, and no obfuscation or malware patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for updating version information in a script file. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
