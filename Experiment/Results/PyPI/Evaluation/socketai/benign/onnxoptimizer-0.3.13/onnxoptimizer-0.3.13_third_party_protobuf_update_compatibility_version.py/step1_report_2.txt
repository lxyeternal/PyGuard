{
  "purpose": "The script updates a version identifier in a file, specifically replacing the 'LAST_RELEASED' variable with a new version string provided as a command-line argument.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from command-line arguments (sys.argv) and reading the 'tests.sh' file from disk.",
  "sinks": "The code writes updates to 'tests.sh' by overwriting its contents after modification.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (version strings) -> validation and parsing -> reading 'tests.sh' -> line modification with regex -> overwriting 'tests.sh' with updated content.",
  "anomalies": "None observed. The code performs straightforward string replacement; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script validates input version format and optional RC parameter, then updates 'tests.sh' by replacing the 'LAST_RELEASED' variable with the new version. The logic is simple and intended for version management. There are no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version update script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs file modification based on user input without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
