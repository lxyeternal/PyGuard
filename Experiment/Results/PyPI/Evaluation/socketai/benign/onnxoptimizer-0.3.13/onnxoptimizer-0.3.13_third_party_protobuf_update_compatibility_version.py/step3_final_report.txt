{
  "purpose": "The script updates the 'LAST_RELEASED' variable in the 'tests.sh' file based on user input, facilitating version management.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for version input; reads 'tests.sh' file to locate and replace the 'LAST_RELEASED' line.",
  "sinks": "Writes back to 'tests.sh' after modification; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "User provides version input -> script validates input -> reads 'tests.sh' -> replaces 'LAST_RELEASED' line -> writes updated content back to 'tests.sh'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected. The script performs straightforward text replacement with proper validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility that updates a version variable in a shell script. It performs input validation, handles optional RC version argument, reads the target file, applies a regex substitution to update the version, and writes back. No network activity, credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is clear and benign, with no evident security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward version updater with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
