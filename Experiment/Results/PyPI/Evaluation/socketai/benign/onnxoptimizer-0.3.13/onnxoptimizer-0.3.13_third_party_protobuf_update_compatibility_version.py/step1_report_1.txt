{
  "purpose": "The script updates the 'LAST_RELEASED' version in a file named 'tests.sh' based on input version arguments, for compatibility testing purposes.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line arguments (sys.argv), reading the file 'tests.sh'.",
  "sinks": "Writing back to 'tests.sh' after modification.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> Version validation -> File reading -> Line modification -> File writing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no external network calls, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments for version info, validates input format, and optionally exits if conditions are not met. It reads a script file ('tests.sh'), updates the line starting with 'LAST_RELEASED=' to the new version, and writes the updated content back. The code functions solely as a version updater without performing any malicious actions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling observed. The code appears to be a straightforward utility script for maintaining version info in a file.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for updating version info in a script file. No malicious behavior, no suspicious activity detected. It performs simple text processing based on user input.",
