{
  "purpose": "The script updates the 'LAST_RELEASED' version in a file named 'tests.sh' based on a provided version input, likely for compatibility testing or release management.",
  "sources": "User input from command line arguments: sys.argv[1] and sys.argv[2].",
  "targets": "The 'tests.sh' file being read and written, specifically lines matching 'LAST_RELEASED=.*$'.",
  "flows": "Command line arguments are parsed and validated; if valid, the 'RewriteTextFile' function reads 'tests.sh', modifies lines containing 'LAST_RELEASED', and writes back the updated content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected. The script performs straightforward text processing and file rewriting with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. No network activity, no credential handling, no backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts a version string and optionally an RC version number, performs validation, and conditionally exits. It defines a function to update a specific line in a file. The 'ReplaceVersion' function replaces the 'LAST_RELEASED' variable with the new version. The code only modifies the 'tests.sh' script, performing simple regex-based text replacement. No external or secret data is handled. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The script appears to be a typical release management utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version updater utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only modifies a specific line in a script file to update version information, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
