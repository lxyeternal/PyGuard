{
  "purpose": "This code is a complex setup script for building the 'onnxoptimizer' Python package, involving version management, environment-based configuration, and CMake integration.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from files, invokes subprocesses ('git rev-parse', 'cmake'), and reads environment variables for build options.",
  "sinks": "File writes for version info, subprocess calls for build configuration, directory and file operations.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables and subprocess outputs; Sink: build commands, version files, build artifacts.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity detected. Reliance on environment variables and subprocess calls is typical but could be exploited if environment is maliciously manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard build setup tasks: retrieving git hash, configuring build options via environment variables, invoking external build tools, and copying build artifacts. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are typical for build scripts, and environment variables are used for configuration, which is standard but could be a vector for exploitation if environment is compromised. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of malicious payloads or obfuscation. Risks are minimal and related to typical build environment concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured build setup script with no malicious intent. The absence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation is confirmed. The potential security risks are limited to environment variable manipulation, which is common in build processes. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard build environment considerations.",
