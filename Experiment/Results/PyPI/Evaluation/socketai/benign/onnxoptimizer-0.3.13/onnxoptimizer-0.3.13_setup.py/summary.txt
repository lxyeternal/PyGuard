  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured build setup script with no malicious intent. The absence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation is confirmed. The potential security risks are limited to environment variable manipulation, which is common in build processes. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard build environment considerations."
