{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for building and installing the 'onnxoptimizer' Python package, including compilation via CMake and custom build commands.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, subprocess outputs (git version), user inputs (extra CMake args), file reads (VERSION_NUMBER, version.py), and build configurations.",
  "sinks": "File write operations (version.py), subprocess calls (cmake, git), environment variable expansions, and file copying during build.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and user inputs influence build configuration, subprocess calls execute build commands, and files are written or copied based on build status and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to retrieve git hash, dynamic environment variable checks for build options, and generation of version file. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment setup, build configuration, and compilation for a Python package using CMake. It dynamically retrieves version info, sets build options based on environment variables, and manages build steps through custom commands. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are evident. The subprocess calls are standard for build processes, and the file operations are limited to configuration and versioning files. The code follows typical patterns for complex Python package build scripts with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured build script for a Python package involving CMake compilation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It primarily manages build configuration, versioning, and file operations in the context of package installation.",
