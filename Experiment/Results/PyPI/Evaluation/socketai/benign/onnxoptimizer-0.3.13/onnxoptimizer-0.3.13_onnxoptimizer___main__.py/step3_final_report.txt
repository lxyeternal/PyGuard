  "purpose": "Minimal entry point script that imports and executes the main module for an ONNX optimizer.",
  "sources": "Import of the local 'main' module; execution of main() if script is run directly.",
  "sinks": "None present in this snippet; potential sinks depend on 'main()' implementation.",
  "flows": "Script flow from import to execution of main() upon direct run.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for CLI entry points.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard Python script serving as an entry point. It imports a 'main' module and executes main() if run directly. Comments indicate the code is experimental, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The core functionality resides in 'main()', which is not provided; thus, potential issues within 'main()' cannot be assessed. The code shows no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the minimal and benign nature of the snippet. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal entry point script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The overall security risk is very low, pending review of 'main()' implementation for comprehensive security assessment.",
