  "purpose": "To provide a command-line interface for optimizing ONNX models using the 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' module and executes its main() function if run as a script.",
  "sinks": "The execution of main() when run as a script; potential for untrusted input handling within main(), but not directly visible here.",
  "flows": "Execution flow from the script entry point to the main() function in the imported module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. The comment indicates experimental code, but no malicious actions are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement and a conditional that executes main() if the script is run directly. It does not process any data directly or perform any operations that could be malicious. The imported module 'main' is a potential source of untrusted data processing, but it is not included here for review. The comments suggest the code is experimental, but nothing malicious or suspicious is evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple entry point for a larger package related to ONNX model optimization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks within this fragment. The security profile depends on the implementation of the 'main' module, which is not provided.",
