{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for an ONNX model optimizer, enabling users to optimize their models.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' module from the current package and executes it if the script is run as the main program.",
  "sinks": "The script executes 'main()' which could potentially contain untrusted operations; however, the current code does not directly perform any data handling or I/O.",
  "flows": "If executed as '__main__', it calls 'main()', which is a potential sink; however, without the implementation of 'main', flow analysis cannot determine specific source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a module import and a script entry point; there are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script that imports a 'main' function from the same package and executes it when run directly. It is explicitly marked as highly experimental with a disclaimer, indicating the API may change. There are no evident malicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious operations within this snippet. The presence of a package import and execution pattern is standard for Python CLI tools. Since the core functionality is delegated to 'main', without its implementation, potential malicious activity cannot be entirely ruled out, but based on this snippet alone, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard minimal entry point for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks within this fragment. Its simplicity and clear purpose suggest it is safe in isolation.",
