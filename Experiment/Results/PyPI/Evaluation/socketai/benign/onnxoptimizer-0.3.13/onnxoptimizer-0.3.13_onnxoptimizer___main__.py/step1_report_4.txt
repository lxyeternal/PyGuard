{
  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as an entry point for an ONNX model optimizer, providing users with an API to optimize their models.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'main' module within the same package, which likely contains the core functionality and possibly reads model data or input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'main()' which could potentially handle untrusted input or data; no direct sinks are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Execution flow is straightforward: if run as main, it invokes main(), which may process inputs or data internally.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, with a note indicating experimental and unstable API, but contains no suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hidden backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple executable entry point that imports and calls a main function. No data handling, user input processing, or network activity is visible here. The note about being 'experimental' suggests caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The absence of any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic points to benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, standard entry point for an ONNX optimizer package, with no apparent malicious behavior. Its simplicity and lack of suspicious features suggest it is safe, assuming the 'main' module is also secure.",
