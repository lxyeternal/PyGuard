{
  "purpose": "To provide an entry point for an ONNX model optimizer tool, allowing users to optimize their models.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from the current package.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function when script is run directly.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'main' and executes it if run as the main program.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscated elements; the only notable point is the 'EXPERIMENTAL' warning indicating unstable API.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script that imports a 'main' module from the current package and executes its 'main()' function if run as a script. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious commands. The presence of an 'EXPERIMENTAL' warning suggests the API is unstable but does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident. The code's simplicity indicates it functions as an executable script to run the optimizer, with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as an entry point to run an ONNX optimizer module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The only concern is the 'experimental' status, which warns users about API stability but does not suggest malicious intent.",
