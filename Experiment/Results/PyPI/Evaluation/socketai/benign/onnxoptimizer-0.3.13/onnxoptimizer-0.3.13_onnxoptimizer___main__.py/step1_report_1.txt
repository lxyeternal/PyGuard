{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for an ONNX optimizer module, allowing users to optimize machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Imports from the current package (`from . import main`), and execution triggered by `if __name__ == '__main__': main()`",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data or external effects are triggered in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import main, then execute main() if the script is run directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, well-structured, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'main' from the same package and executes its main() function if the script is run as the main program. The comments indicate that the code is experimental, which suggests caution but does not imply malicious intent. No external data inputs, no suspicious code execution, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The code appears to be a typical Python script serving as an executable entry point for a package functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, minimal entry point script for an ONNX optimizer module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
