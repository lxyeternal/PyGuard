  "purpose": "A wrapper around external C++ functions to optimize ONNX models by serializing models, calling external optimization routines, and handling temporary files with cleanup.",
  "sources": "ModelProto serialization, external C++ functions (C.optimize, C.optimize_fixedpoint, etc.), temporary files for external data storage",
  "sinks": "External C++ functions invoked with model data, temporary files written to disk",
  "flows": "Serialize model -> pass data to C++ functions -> receive optimized model data -> load back into ONNX",
  "anomalies": "Use of temporary files with delete=False but proper cleanup in finally blocks; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; no network activity or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code securely wraps external C++ routines for model optimization, handling serialization and temporary files appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity are present. External functions are trusted libraries, but their integrity depends on external sources. The code's structure is straightforward, with proper error handling and cleanup. Risk primarily stems from reliance on external modules, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for ONNX model optimization. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to external dependencies, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low risk score around 0.15.",
