  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious activity, code logic, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements transaction logging with triggers, functions, and ORM classes. It uses dynamic SQL for trigger creation but appears standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior identified.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, justified by the dynamic SQL, but it's standard for schema setup.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The dynamic SQL is typical for schema creation, not malicious. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on potential risks from dynamic SQL creation and configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — justified; dynamic SQL could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but in this context, inputs seem controlled.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard versioning and trigger setup, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The scores seem appropriate given the controlled use of dynamic SQL.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on ORM class creation, trigger setup, and schema management. No suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — acceptable; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard transaction logging code.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard ORM and trigger creation, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — consistent with controlled use of string formatting.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate versioning system.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound, and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights potential risks in dynamic SQL creation, but concludes no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — justified, as dynamic SQL could be risky if inputs are compromised, but appears controlled.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure within its scope, no supply chain issues.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The cautious approach to dynamic SQL is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity or code behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, code is clear.\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 across all reports seem appropriate given the use of dynamic SQL for schema creation, which is common but warrants cautious deployment.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — due to dynamic SQL, but not inherently dangerous here.\n\n**Note:** If I were to adjust scores, I might consider keeping the risk at 0.2, as the dynamic SQL, while controlled, can be a vector if inputs are manipulated. However, given the context, the current scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurately reflect the code's nature. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily due to the use of dynamic SQL in schema setup, which is standard practice but should be used carefully in untrusted environments.",
