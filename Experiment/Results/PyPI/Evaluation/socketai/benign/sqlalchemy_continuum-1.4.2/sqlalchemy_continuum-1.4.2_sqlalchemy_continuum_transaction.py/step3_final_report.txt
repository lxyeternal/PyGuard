  "purpose": "Implement transaction logging with schema, triggers, and ORM classes for change tracking and versioning.",
  "sources": "Schema creation SQL strings, ORM class attributes, trigger functions, and event listeners.",
  "sinks": "Trigger functions executing dynamic SQL, ORM relationships, and schema modifications.",
  "flows": "Schema setup SQL strings → Trigger functions → ORM class instantiation and relationships.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting for SQL in trigger creation, but inputs are controlled and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a transaction logging system with schema, triggers, and ORM classes. It uses dynamic SQL for trigger functions, but these are constructed from controlled, static strings, typical for schema setup. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The use of dynamic SQL poses minimal risk given the context. The malware score is 0, as no malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal risk associated with controlled dynamic SQL in schema creation. All reports correctly identify the code as standard, with no malicious intent or obfuscation, and assign low risk scores consistent with the code's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of transaction versioning and audit logging using SQLAlchemy, triggers, and schema management. It poses minimal security risk, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of dynamic SQL is controlled and typical for schema setup, not malicious. Therefore, the supply chain security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
