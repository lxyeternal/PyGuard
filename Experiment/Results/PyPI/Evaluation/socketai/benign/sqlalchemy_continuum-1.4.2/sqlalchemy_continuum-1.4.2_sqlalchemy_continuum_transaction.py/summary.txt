  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of transaction versioning and audit logging using SQLAlchemy, triggers, and schema management. It poses minimal security risk, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of dynamic SQL is controlled and typical for schema setup, not malicious. Therefore, the supply chain security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."
