  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is a standard Python setup script (`setup.py`) for the `SQLAlchemy-Continuum` package.\n- They confirm that the code performs static configuration tasks: reading version info from a file, defining dependencies, and setting package metadata.\n- No untrusted data processing, dynamic code execution, network activity, or system calls are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code uses common patterns such as regex for version extraction, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct for its purpose. The version extraction regex is straightforward and matches the typical pattern.\n- **Malicious activity:** No malicious activity or malware is evident.\n- **Security risks:** No external input handling, no network or system calls, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and standard; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None identified; the code is static configuration.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n### Logical flaws or anomalies:\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The version extraction via regex from a local file is standard practice.\n- The dependencies and setup parameters are straightforward.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The **malware score** is correctly 0; no malware is present.\n- The **obfuscated score** is correctly 0; no obfuscation.\n- The **risk score** is 0; no security risks are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports and the detailed reasoning, I concur with the evaluations.\n\n**However, considering the context of supply chain security:**\n- The code is purely static configuration with no runtime input or external interactions.\n- The only minor point is the regex-based version extraction, which is standard and safe.\n- No hidden or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n**Therefore, my estimated scores are:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0** |\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, safe `setup.py` script with no malicious or security concerns. It is safe for distribution and use.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that the `__init__.py` file contains a correctly formatted `__version__` string, but this is standard practice and not a security concern.",
