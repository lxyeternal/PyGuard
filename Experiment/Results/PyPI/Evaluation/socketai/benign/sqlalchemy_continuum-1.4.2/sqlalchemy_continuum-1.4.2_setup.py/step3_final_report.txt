{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging the SQLAlchemy-Continuum library, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'sqlalchemy_continuum/__init__.py' using regex; static dependency definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "Reading version file (source) to setup configuration (sink); no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static configuration tasks typical for Python packaging. It reads version info from a local file with regex, defines dependencies explicitly, and sets package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The regex pattern assumes a standard format for '__version__', which is common practice. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code are present. All signals indicate a benign, standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Python setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly assess this, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. No changes are necessary.",
