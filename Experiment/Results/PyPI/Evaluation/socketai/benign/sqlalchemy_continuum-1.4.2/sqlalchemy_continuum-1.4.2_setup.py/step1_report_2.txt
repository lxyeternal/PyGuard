{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the SQLAlchemy-Continuum package, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading package files (__init__.py) for version, importing standard libraries os, sys, re, and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data inputs are limited to reading the version file and package metadata; no data sinks or external system calls are evident.",
  "flows": "The code reads the version from a file and uses that in the setup function; dependencies are specified statically; no user input flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hidden functionalities are present. The get_version() function reads a file to extract version info, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads the version from a source file using regex, defines dependencies, and calls setup() with package metadata. All operations are straightforward file reading and package setup; no user input, no dynamic code execution, and no external network interactions. The code appears typical for Python package setup scripts with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies without any external or unsafe operations.",
