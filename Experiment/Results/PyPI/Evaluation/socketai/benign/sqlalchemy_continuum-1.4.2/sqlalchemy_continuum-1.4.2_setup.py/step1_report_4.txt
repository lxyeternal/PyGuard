{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'SQLAlchemy-Continuum' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package information for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the package's __init__.py file to extract version; defining dependencies in dictionaries and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks that process untrusted input or data flows leading to security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks are apparent; the code primarily handles static configuration and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The version extraction relies on regex parsing of a source file, which is standard. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static configuration for packaging the project, reading version info from a file, and setting dependencies. It combines optional dependencies into testing requirements and sets metadata. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No network, cryptographic, or sensitive data handling is present. No signs of malicious code or backdoors. The code adheres to typical setup.py conventions without suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is safe, with no anomalous or suspicious patterns.",
