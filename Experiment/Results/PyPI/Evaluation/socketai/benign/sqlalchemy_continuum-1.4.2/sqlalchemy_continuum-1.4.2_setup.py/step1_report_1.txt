{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'SQLAlchemy-Continuum', intended to package and distribute the library with its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ variable from 'sqlalchemy_continuum/__init__.py', reads the setup configuration, and defines dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any typical sinks that execute untrusted data; no system commands, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The version extraction flows from reading a local file; dependencies are defined statically; no runtime data processing or external input handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code uses standard practices for Python package setup. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading a version string from a file, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. It does not process untrusted input or execute any code beyond static configuration. No security risks, malicious behavior, or suspicious activities are identified. It is a typical setup.py script with no indications of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It is safe for use and does not contain malware.",
