{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the SQLAlchemy-Continuum package, used for packaging and distributing the extension.",
  "sources": "Reading the package's __init__.py file to extract version; reading package metadata; importing os, sys, re modules; reading requirements from dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None of the code involves untrusted input, user data, or external data sources; no dangerous sinks like network connections, system calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flow; version extraction from file, package metadata setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup activities: importing modules, defining dependencies, reading version info from a file, and configuring package metadata. It uses regex to extract version info, which is a standard approach. No user input, network operations, or system modifications are present. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. It handles package configuration and dependencies securely without any suspicious or malicious operations.",
