  "purpose": "This code defines classes for reflecting and building versioning tables in SQLAlchemy, likely for auditing or version control purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration options via self.option(), and accesses parent_table columns via self.parent_table.c. It also inspects models using sa.inspect().",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows include the creation of Column objects with configurable attributes and the construction of a new Table object with dynamic columns. No direct data sinks or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "flows": "Options are retrieved and used to define columns; reflected columns are copied and adjusted, then used to construct a version table. There are no external data flows or user input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are observed. The code appears to be straightforward SQLAlchemy ORM table reflection and construction logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: ColumnReflector for creating reflected and possibly modified column copies, and TableBuilder for constructing versioning tables based on a parent table and configuration options. Both classes rely on configuration options fetched via self.option(). The reflect_column method creates a copy of a column, modifies its attributes, and attempts to set its key based on model inspection. The TableBuilder constructs a new Table with columns generated from ColumnReflector, and provides a method to build the table dynamically, possibly extending an existing table. There is no indication of data being sourced from untrusted input, nor any code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is if options like table names or column names are influenced externally, but no such handling suggests malicious intent, just configuration-based dynamic table creation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation for reflecting and creating version tables in SQLAlchemy, with configurable options. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as part of a versioning or auditing system, with no evident security issues or supply chain attacks.",
