  "purpose": "The code defines classes for reflecting and constructing version control tables based on a parent SQLAlchemy table, utilizing configuration options and model inspection to generate schema components.",
  "sources": "Configuration options accessed via self.option(), model inspection via sa.inspect(self.model), parent_table columns.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is executed or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Configuration options influence column and table definitions; no external data flows into untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting in 'table_name' property with '%' operator, which could be exploited if options are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code performs schema reflection and table creation using SQLAlchemy, relying on configuration options and model inspection. No external input is executed as code, and no network activity occurs. The only potential concern is the use of string formatting in 'table_name', which could be manipulated if options are sourced from untrusted inputs, possibly leading to malformed table names or injection-like issues. The code's logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected. The scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a minor security risk due to configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate ORM extension for versioning, with no malicious intent. The primary security consideration is the dynamic string formatting of table names, which should be validated or sanitized if options are externally controlled. Overall, the code is safe, with a very low security risk.",
