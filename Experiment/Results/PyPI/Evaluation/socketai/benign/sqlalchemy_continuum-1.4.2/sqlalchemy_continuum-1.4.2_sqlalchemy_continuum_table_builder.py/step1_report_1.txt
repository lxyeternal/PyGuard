  "purpose": "The code defines classes for reflecting and building version control tables based on SQLAlchemy models and configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration options via self.option() and interacts with SQLAlchemy model and table objects, including inspecting model columns.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs SQLAlchemy Column and Table objects, potentially influenced by configuration options; no direct untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Configuration options and model/column data flow into column reflection and table construction, influencing generated SQLAlchemy schema objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no evidence of obfuscated or malicious code. Usage of reflection and dynamic table/column creation appears standard for ORM extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a reflective mechanism for SQLAlchemy columns and constructs versioning tables based on configurations. It uses dynamic attribute access and reflection but does not execute any untrusted code or perform network operations. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. It strictly manipulates database schema objects based on provided models and options. The design relies on standard ORM practices without suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate ORM extension for managing versioned tables, with no malicious behavior detected. It dynamically constructs schema components based on configuration and model data, adhering to normal practices. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
