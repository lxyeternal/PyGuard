  "purpose": "A utility class for reverting ORM object states and relationships within a SQLAlchemy session, typically used for undoing or rolling back changes.",
  "sources": "Reads object attributes, relationship properties, and session methods such as delete and add; inspects ORM relationships and object states.",
  "sinks": "Deletes objects from session, modifies object attributes, appends related objects, potentially leading to data loss if misused, but no malicious data exfiltration or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Source: ORM object attributes and relationships; Sink: session.delete, session.add, attribute setting; Flow: object properties and relationships are copied or reverted, with recursive reversion of related objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard ORM practices; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs; recursive reversion is complex but legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a recursive reversion utility for SQLAlchemy ORM objects, copying properties and managing relationships with session operations. It uses standard SQLAlchemy inspection and session management functions. No external inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The logic aligns with typical ORM rollback or undo patterns, and no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The recursive handling of relationships and deletion operations could pose data integrity risks if misused, but this is inherent to reversion utilities and not malicious. The malware score is therefore set to 0, and the security risk is very low, around 0.1–0.2, reflecting the potential for misuse but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate ORM object reversion utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. It operates within expected patterns for database rollback or undo functions. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe for supply chain use.",
