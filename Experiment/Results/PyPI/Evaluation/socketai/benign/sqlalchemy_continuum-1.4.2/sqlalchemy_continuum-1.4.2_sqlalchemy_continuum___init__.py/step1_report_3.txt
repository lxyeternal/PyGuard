{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to enable and disable versioning on SQLAlchemy mappers and sessions for database schema change tracking.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as mapper, session, manager, plugins, options, and user_cls; imported modules; environment variables (indirectly via SQLAlchemy events).",
  "sinks": "SQLAlchemy event hooks (listen/remove) that modify database operation behaviors; potentially affecting SQL execution flow.",
  "flows": "Parameters passed into make_versioned or remove_versioning influence event listener registration/removal, which modify SQLAlchemy engine event handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration functions for SQLAlchemy versioning, registering event listeners to track and clear operations, and to manage connection states. It imports various modules, sets a version string, and uses standard SQLAlchemy event hooks. The event handling functions attach or detach listeners that influence SQL execution and connection management, but do not execute untrusted code, handle external data, or perform malicious actions. No suspicious variables, dynamic code execution, or external network activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of versioning setup for SQLAlchemy using event hooks. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It mainly manages event listeners for version control, with no harmful or suspicious operations detected.",
