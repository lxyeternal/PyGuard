  "purpose": "This code provides functions to enable or disable versioning on SQLAlchemy ORM mappers and sessions, including event listeners for SQLAlchemy engine events.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (.exc, .manager, .operation, .transaction, .unit_of_work, .utils) and SQLAlchemy library components; configuration parameters for functions",
  "sinks": "Event listener registration and removal on SQLAlchemy engine events, which could influence database operation flow but are standard for ORM event handling",
  "flows": "make_versioned and remove_versioning functions set or remove event listeners that tie into engine events, which can trigger functions during database operations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard setup and teardown for ORM versioning with event hooks, with no obscure or unnecessary dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two main functions: make_versioned and remove_versioning. These functions configure and remove event listeners on SQLAlchemy engine events, facilitating automatic version tracking. No user input is read directly, and no untrusted data flow exists. The event listeners are standard for ORM extension modules. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are detected. All imports are from known libraries or local modules. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SQLAlchemy versioning setup and teardown with event listeners. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall structure and logic appear normal for an ORM extension module. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
