  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for versioning errors and related issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code solely defines classes and does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines exceptions without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes, all inheriting from built-in Exception or another custom error. There are no data processing, external interactions, or dynamic code execution. The structure is standard for defining exception hierarchies in Python. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a simple, benign component for error handling within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, non-malicious definition of custom exceptions with no signs of malware or security issues. It poses no threat and is safe for use.",
