  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for versioning errors and configuration issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains only class definitions without any suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions inheriting from built-in exception classes. There are no external data sources, no untrusted data handling, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated code. The classes are named to represent specific error conditions related to versioning and configuration, which appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
