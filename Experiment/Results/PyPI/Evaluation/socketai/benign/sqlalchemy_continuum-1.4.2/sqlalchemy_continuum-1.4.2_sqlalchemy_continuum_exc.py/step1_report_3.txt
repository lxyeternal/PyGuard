  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to versioning errors and misconfiguration.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations inheriting from base exceptions. No external data, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive information handling are present. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code serves a purely structural purpose, likely within a larger application for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is safe, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply defines exception classes for use elsewhere.",
