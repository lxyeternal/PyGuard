  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception` or `VersioningError`.\n   - No data sources, sinks, flows, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly describe the code as benign, straightforward, and standard for defining exception classes.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows, external interactions, or malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code indicate no malicious activity, no elevated risk scores are justified.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as custom exception definitions.\n   - Therefore, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious payload, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus solely on the code's structure.\n   - They do not infer vulnerabilities or malicious intent where none exists.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, straightforward set of custom exception classes with no external data handling, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and standard for defining custom exceptions. The scores provided are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
