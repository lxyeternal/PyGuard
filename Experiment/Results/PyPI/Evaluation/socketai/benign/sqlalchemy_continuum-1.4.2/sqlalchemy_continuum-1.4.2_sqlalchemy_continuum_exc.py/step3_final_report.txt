  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for versioning and configuration errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, nor any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is static, simple, and serves as error indicators. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No signs of malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The code's structure and purpose are clear and standard, with no anomalies or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
