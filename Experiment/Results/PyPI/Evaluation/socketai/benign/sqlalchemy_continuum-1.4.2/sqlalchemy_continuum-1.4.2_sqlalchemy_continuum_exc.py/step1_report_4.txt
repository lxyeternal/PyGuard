  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to versioning errors and configuration issues.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or untrusted data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could be exploited are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard Exception classes, serving as custom error types. There are no inputs, outputs, or control flow that could be exploited. The structure is straightforward and typical for custom exceptions. No malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
