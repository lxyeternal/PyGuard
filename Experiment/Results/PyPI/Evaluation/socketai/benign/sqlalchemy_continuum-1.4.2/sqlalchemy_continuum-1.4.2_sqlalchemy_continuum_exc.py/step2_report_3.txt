  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n- The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions.\n- No data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- The classes are named logically for versioning and configuration errors.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, benign, and solely for error handling.\n- They uniformly conclude no malicious intent, no security risks, and no obfuscation.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which makes sense since there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Inconsistencies**:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the code.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is standard and harmless.\n\n5. **Final Justification**:\n- Given the evidence, the scores assigned are appropriate.\n- The malware score remains at 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as the code is clear.\n- The security risk score remains at 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Overall Estimate**:\n- I agree with the provided scores.\n- The code's malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at 0.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions.\n- The reports' reasoning is accurate and well-supported.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation**:\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code poses no security threat.",
