  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from built-in exception classes. There are no data sources, sinks, or data flows, and no dynamic or obfuscated code present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is straightforward, benign, and typical for defining custom exceptions. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**:  \nSince the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions, data processing, or suspicious constructs, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:  \nThe reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's structure and intent, which is purely for error handling.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \nScores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risk present.\n\n**Overall**, the code is a standard, harmless set of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The scoring is appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
