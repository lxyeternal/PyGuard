  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception classes.\n   - There are no data sources, sinks, data flows, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is straightforward class definitions with no malicious or security issues.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident in the reports.\n   - The reasoning that these are benign, standard exception classes is sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher than 0.5**:\n   - The code shows no signs of malware or security risk, so risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes with no malicious behavior, malware score should be 0.\n   - All reports agree on this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a simple, standard set of custom exception class definitions.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, with no security issues. The reports are accurate and thorough. No adjustments are necessary.",
