  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:  \n   The provided code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception` or `VersioningError`. All reports agree that the code is static, contains no data processing, external inputs/outputs, or dynamic code execution. The classes are straightforward and serve as error indicators.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   None of the reports identify any issues with the code. They all conclude the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious constructs.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, malware, or security risks. No logical flaws or misjudgments are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's lack of external interactions or sensitive data handling.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are 0, there's no need to justify higher risk scores. The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as purely structural with no malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a harmless, standard set of exception class definitions. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
