  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building documentation of the SQLAlchemy-Continuum project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, os, and sqlalchemy_continuum; assignment of __version__ from sqlalchemy_continuum; configuration variables for Sphinx.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; configuration parameters are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the only dynamic import is __version__, which is from a trusted package.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is purely configuration and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no logic that processes external input or executes untrusted code. It imports sys, os, and __version__ from a known package, then sets various configuration options for documentation building. There are no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted data. All elements are static and typical for documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. It solely sets parameters for documentation generation, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
