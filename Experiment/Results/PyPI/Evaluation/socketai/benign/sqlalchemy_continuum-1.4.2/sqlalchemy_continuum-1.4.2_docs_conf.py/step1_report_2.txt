  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation using Sphinx for the SQLAlchemy-Continuum project.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`import sys, os`, `from sqlalchemy_continuum import __version__`), os.path manipulations, and the entire configuration setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file write, or execution commands that process untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns detected. The code primarily sets up documentation parameters and imports project version information.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with imports, path modifications, and configuration variables for generating documentation. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute any dynamic code based on input. The import of `__version__` from `sqlalchemy_continuum` is a benign operation intended to embed the package version in documentation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The structure and content are consistent with typical documentation build setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate configuration script for Sphinx documentation and shows no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or security risks.",
