  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Source and Purpose**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a Sphinx configuration script for building documentation for the SQLAlchemy-Continuum project.\n   - The sources are primarily import statements (`sys`, `os`, and `__version__` from `sqlalchemy_continuum`) and path modifications.\n   - No external or untrusted data sources are involved.\n\n2. **Code Behavior and Data Flows**:\n   - No evidence of data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted input.\n   - The import of `__version__` is benign, used for embedding version info in documentation.\n\n3. **Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - No obfuscation, unusual code constructs, or hidden logic.\n   - The code strictly performs configuration setup.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The code is static, with no runtime input handling.\n   - Path modifications are straightforward and safe.\n   - The import from a trusted package (`sqlalchemy_continuum`) is standard practice.\n\n5. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Risk scores are 0 or 0.5; given the static nature and lack of external effects, these are reasonable.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), consistent with the analysis.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores across reports are consistent.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's content and behavior.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (appropriate, as the code is purely configuration with no security risks)\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a standard, benign configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
