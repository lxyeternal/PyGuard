  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building project documentation using Sphinx for the SQLAlchemy-Continuum package.",
  "sources": "Import statements (import sys, os, from sqlalchemy_continuum import __version__), sys.path modification, __version__ import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily manages configuration variables and paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The code is standard for Sphinx documentation configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file, importing modules, setting configuration options, and defining output options for HTML, LaTeX, manual pages, and other formats. It only manipulates local variables and paths without any external or untrusted data handling. The only import from a package (__version__ from sqlalchemy_continuum) is used to set version info, which is standard. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets up documentation parameters and imports a version string from a package.",
