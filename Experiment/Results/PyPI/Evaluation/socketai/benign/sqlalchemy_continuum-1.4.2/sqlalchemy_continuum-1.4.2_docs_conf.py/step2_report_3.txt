  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file for building documentation.\n- It imports system modules (`sys`, `os`) and the package version (`__version__` from `sqlalchemy_continuum`).\n- It sets various configuration options for documentation output formats.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or handling of untrusted input.\n- The import of `__version__` is a benign operation to embed version info.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- **Purpose:** All describe the code as a configuration script for Sphinx documentation, which is accurate.\n- **Sources:** Import statements and path modifications are standard.\n- **Sinks:** No dangerous sinks or external data processing.\n- **Flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical setup for documentation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Conclusion:** All reports agree that this is a benign, standard configuration file.\n\n**Confidence:** All are high (1.0), as the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Regarding scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not execute any external commands, handle untrusted input, or contain obfuscated logic.\n- The import of `__version__` from `sqlalchemy_continuum` is a common pattern to embed version info.\n- Path manipulations are static and do not pose security issues.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the code's content and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate after review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical, safe configuration script with no security concerns.",
