  "purpose": "This code is a configuration script for building documentation with Sphinx for the SQLAlchemy-Continuum project.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, os, and __version__ from sqlalchemy_continuum; path modifications with sys.path.insert.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static setup without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard configuration with no suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, and sets configuration variables for documentation output. It does not execute external commands, handle untrusted input, or contain obfuscated code. The import of __version__ is benign, used for embedding version info. Path modifications are straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safe, static setup.",
