  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation for the SQLAlchemy-Continuum project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, os, and __version__ from sqlalchemy_continuum; os.path.abspath and sys.path.insert for path modifications.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no execution of external commands or code injection points.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code mainly sets configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code mainly contains standard configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx configuration file. It imports system modules and the package version, then sets various configuration options for documentation generation. There are no indications of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, external network activity, or obfuscated code is present. All imported modules are standard or relevant to documentation build. No hidden backdoors or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard documentation build configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
