  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation of the SQLAlchemy-Continuum project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "import sys, os; sys.path.insert; from sqlalchemy_continuum import __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; primarily static configuration setup.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; only static import and path manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. Standard Sphinx configuration pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration script with imports, path modifications, and settings for various output formats. The import of '__version__' from 'sqlalchemy_continuum' is standard for version reporting. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling is present. No obfuscation or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration file for documentation build, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
