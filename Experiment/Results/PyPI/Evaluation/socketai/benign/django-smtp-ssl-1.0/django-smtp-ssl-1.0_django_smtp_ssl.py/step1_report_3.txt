  "purpose": "Custom SMTP SSL email backend for Django that establishes a secure connection to send emails.",
  "sources": "Reads host, port, username, password, and DNS_NAME.get_fqdn() for establishing the connection.",
  "sinks": "Uses smtplib.SMTP_SSL to create a secure connection, and performs login with provided credentials.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration data (host, port, username, password, DNS_NAME), then creates and authenticates an SMTP SSL connection.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; use of try-except without specific exception handling is standard but may obscure errors. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django email backend subclass that opens an SMTP SSL connection. It retrieves DNS information dynamically, and logs in if credentials are provided. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; the code appears straightforward and intended solely for sending emails securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a standard secure email connection method with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It responsibly handles exceptions and uses standard libraries.",
