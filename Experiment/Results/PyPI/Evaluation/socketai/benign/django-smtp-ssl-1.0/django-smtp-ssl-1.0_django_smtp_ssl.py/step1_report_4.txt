  "purpose": "Custom SMTP SSL email backend for Django to securely send emails via SMTP_SSL.",
  "sources": "Reads host, port, username, password, and DNS_NAME for local_hostname.",
  "sinks": "Uses smtplib.SMTP_SSL to establish a secure connection, performs login with credentials.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials, DNS_NAME) flows into SMTP_SSL connection setup and login process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, standard library usage. DNS_NAME is a Django utility, not user input.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Django's EmailBackend, overriding the open() method to create an SMTP_SSL connection using provided host, port, and DNS_NAME for local_hostname. Credentials are used only for login, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a secure email backend without any malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard, secure email connection method without malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It appears to be a legitimate, purposeful extension of Django's email backend.",
