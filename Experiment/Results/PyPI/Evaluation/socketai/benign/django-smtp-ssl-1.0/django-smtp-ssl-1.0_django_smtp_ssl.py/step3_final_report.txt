  "purpose": "Establish a secure SMTP SSL connection for sending emails within Django, using provided host, port, credentials, and DNS-based local hostname.",
  "sources": "self.host, self.port, self.username, self.password, DNS_NAME.get_fqdn()",
  "sinks": "self.connection.login(self.username, self.password)",
  "flows": "Initialization of SMTP_SSL connection -> login with credentials",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except block without specific exception handling; reliance on external DNS_NAME utility",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass of Django's EmailBackend that creates an SMTP_SSL connection with specified host and port, using DNS_NAME.get_fqdn() for local hostname. It performs login if credentials are provided. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The broad exception handling may obscure errors but is a common pattern. No malicious payloads or backdoors are detected. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with the code's benign and standard nature. The code's purpose is legitimate, and no vulnerabilities are evident. The minor risk score reflects the broad exception handling but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation for SMTP over SSL in Django, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is low risk.",
