  "purpose": "Custom SMTP SSL email backend for sending emails securely via Django",
  "sources": "self.host, self.port, self.username, self.password, DNS_NAME.get_fqdn()",
  "sinks": "self.connection (SMTP_SSL connection), self.connection.login()",
  "flows": "Uses host and port to establish an SMTP_SSL connection; optionally logs in with username and password",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, standard usage of smtplib and Django utilities",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Django's EmailBackend to establish an SMTP SSL connection. It retrieves DNS name via DNS_NAME.get_fqdn() for local hostname, then connects securely to the SMTP server. If credentials are provided, it logs in. Error handling is present but broad, re-raising exceptions unless fail_silently is set. No malicious behavior, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, or network behavior indicating data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a secure SMTP email backend with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
