  "purpose": "Static package setup script defining metadata for 'django-smtp-ssl' module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded metadata fields within the setup() call, such as name, version, description, author, url, license, py_modules, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, user input, or network activity.",
  "flows": "None; static configuration without data flow or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup from distutils.core and calls setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, user input, external data handling, or runtime behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard packaging boilerplate. The assigned scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static package configuration script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reviews and scores are accurate. No modifications are necessary; the package is safe.",
