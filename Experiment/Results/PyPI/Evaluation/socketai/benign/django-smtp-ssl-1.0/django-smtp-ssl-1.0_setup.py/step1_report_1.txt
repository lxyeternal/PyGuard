  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for the 'django-smtp-ssl' Python module using distutils.",
  "sources": "The entire setup() function call, including parameters such as name, version, description, author, email, url, license, py_modules, zip_safe, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; this code does not handle untrusted data or perform I/O operations that process external inputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this script only sets package metadata without data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils.core.setup and calls it with static metadata for packaging. No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data handling is present. The metadata fields include author contact info and project URL, but these are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The code solely facilitates packaging without performing runtime actions or data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script for packaging a module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no external data processing, no secrets, and no malicious code. The code is benign and serves its purpose as a package configuration.",
