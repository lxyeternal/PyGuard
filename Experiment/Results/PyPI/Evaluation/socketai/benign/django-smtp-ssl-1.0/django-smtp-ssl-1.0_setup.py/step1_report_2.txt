  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup for 'django-smtp-ssl' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters providing package metadata, including name, version, description, author info, URL, license, modules, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or untrusted data handling in this setup script.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining package metadata to passing it to the setup() function, with no untrusted data or external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard setup tools with static metadata; no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from distutils.core, then calls setup() with static, well-formed package metadata. No dynamic code, no input handling, no code execution or external data processing. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears to be a standard, straightforward setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely provides package metadata for distribution purposes.",
