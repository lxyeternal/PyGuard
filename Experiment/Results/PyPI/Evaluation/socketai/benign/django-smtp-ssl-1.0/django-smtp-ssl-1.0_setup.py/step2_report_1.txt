  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It imports `setup` from `distutils.core`.\n- Calls `setup()` with static, hardcoded package metadata.\n- No dynamic code, user input, external data, or runtime behavior.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code.\n- No network activity, data processing, or sensitive information.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**Presence of issues in the code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward package setup script.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all scores are zero for malware and security risk, and the code is purely static configuration, there's no justification for higher scores.\n- The code does not perform any runtime actions, data handling, or network operations.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- The code is standard packaging boilerplate.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n- They rely on static analysis and recognize the code's benign nature.\n\n**Consistency of scores with the reports:**\n- The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall malware score:** **0**  \n**Overall obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Overall security risk score:** **0**  \n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical, static setup script for packaging a Python module. It contains no malicious code, no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no runtime actions that could pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications needed; all correctly identify the benign nature.\n- The scores reflect the actual risk level, which is negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe package is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
