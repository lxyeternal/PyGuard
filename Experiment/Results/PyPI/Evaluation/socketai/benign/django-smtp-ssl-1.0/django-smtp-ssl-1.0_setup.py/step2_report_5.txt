  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python setup script using distutils.core.setup.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic code execution, no user input, and no external data handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this script.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the original provided code.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5, with confidence 1.\n- Given the benign nature, malware should be 0.\n- Obfuscated should be 0; no obfuscation is present.\n- Security risk should be 0, as there's no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The reports do not assign a security risk higher than 0, which is appropriate.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a straightforward, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence presented.",
