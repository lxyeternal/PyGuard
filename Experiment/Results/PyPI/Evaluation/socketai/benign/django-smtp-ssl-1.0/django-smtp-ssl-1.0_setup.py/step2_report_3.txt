  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python module.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic input, external data handling, or runtime code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code only calls `setup()` with static metadata, which is standard practice.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign and standard. There are no indications of malicious code, external data processing, or security risks.  \n  **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Logical errors or flaws?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.  \n  **No errors detected.**\n\n### Scores assigned:\n- All reports assign `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, and `obfuscated=0`.  \n- Given the benign nature, these scores are appropriate.  \n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all evidence points to a benign, standard packaging script, there is no reason to assign higher risk scores.  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Malware score:\n- **Should be 0.**  \n  No malicious activity, code execution, or external data handling is present.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they focus on the static nature of the code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. All reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
