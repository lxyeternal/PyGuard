  "purpose": "The script defines metadata and configuration for packaging a Python module named 'django-smtp-ssl' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata (name, version, description, author, etc.) and imports from 'distutils.core'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission is involved.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'distutils.core' to calling 'setup()' with static parameters, with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. Usage of standard setup script without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for packaging a Python library. It imports a common module, defines static metadata, and calls 'setup()' with fixed parameters. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows leading to sinks, and no unusual or malicious code behavior. The script adheres to typical packaging conventions without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious content. It serves to package and distribute the 'django-smtp-ssl' module and contains no security concerns.",
