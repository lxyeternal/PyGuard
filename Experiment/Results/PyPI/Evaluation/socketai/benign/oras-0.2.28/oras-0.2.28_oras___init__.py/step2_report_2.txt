  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports describe a simple import statement:\n   ```python\n   from oras.version import __version__\n   ```\n   This is a standard practice to retrieve the package version. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. No external input or untrusted data is involved.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - confidence: 1.0\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - malware: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports agree on zero malware, zero obfuscation, and zero security risk, the scores are justified. There is no reason to elevate the risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious activity. The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward import statement.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard import statement used for version retrieval. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of my own estimates:\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0               |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
