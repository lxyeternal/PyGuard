  "purpose": "Retrieve the package version information from the oras library.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from oras.version import __version__",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external interactions occur",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from the oras.version module, which is a standard practice for version retrieval. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution. The code does not involve untrusted inputs, network activity, or data exfiltration. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement used for version information. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
