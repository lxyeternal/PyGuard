  "purpose": "Import the __version__ attribute from the oras.version module, likely to check or display the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statement from oras.version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "None, as the code only imports a version attribute without further processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple import statement",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a version string from a module, which is a common practice to check package version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, execution of untrusted code, or obfuscated constructs. No external input handling, no sinks, and no suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement for obtaining a package version, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
