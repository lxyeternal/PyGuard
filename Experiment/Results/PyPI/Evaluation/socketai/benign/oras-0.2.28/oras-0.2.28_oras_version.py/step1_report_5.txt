  "purpose": "Define package metadata and requirements for the oras Python SDK",
  "sources": "Module-level constants and requirement tuples",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data processing or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "No data flows or input/output interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code solely sets metadata and specifies dependencies for a Python package. There are no input sources, data flows, or potential points where untrusted data could be exploited. The requirement specifications are standard and explicit, with no hidden or malicious intent. The email address appears to be a placeholder or a generic GitHub noreply, which is typical for open-source projects. Overall, the code is straightforward and standard for a package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical package metadata and requirements declaration with no suspicious elements.",
