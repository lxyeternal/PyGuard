{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants, classes, and metadata related to OCI image handling and Docker registry interactions.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input or data; the code primarily sets static configuration variables and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data output points are present that handle untrusted data or could leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only assigns static string and dictionary values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constants, class attributes, and string identifiers related to OCI images and Docker registry configurations. No input handling, data processing, or external communication logic is present. All values are static, known identifiers, and there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration module defining static constants and classes for OCI image and Docker registry metadata. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for legitimate use.",
