{
  "purpose": "Define constants, configurations, and class for Docker registry interaction and OCI image specifications",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily sets static configuration variables and a class with class attributes",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; static assignment of constants and class attributes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration module containing class definitions and constants related to OCI images and Docker registries. No input, output, or dynamic data handling is present. The constants include URLs, media types, annotation keys, file names, block sizes, chunk sizes, and precomputed hash values. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The structure and content are consistent with a static configuration file, and no suspicious or malicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative and configuration-oriented, with no malicious intent, no malicious code, and no security risks detected. It serves as a static reference module for OCI image specifications and Docker registry settings.",
