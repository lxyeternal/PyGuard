{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, configuration classes, and metadata related to Docker registries, OCI images, and content annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string constants, class attributes, and global variables. No external input or data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data, execute code, or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily establishes static configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard configuration and metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable definitions, class attributes, and constants used for Docker and OCI image configuration. There are no functions or runtime data processing. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The constants are typical for image registry configurations and do not pose security risks. The presence of fixed hashes like 'blank_hash' and 'blank_config_hash' are standard placeholders for empty content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static configuration data with no malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security vulnerabilities. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or connect to external systems. Overall, the code is benign.",
