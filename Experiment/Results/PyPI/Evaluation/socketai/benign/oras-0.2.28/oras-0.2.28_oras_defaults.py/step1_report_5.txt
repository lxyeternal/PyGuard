  "purpose": "Define constants, configuration classes, and metadata related to OCI image registries and blobs.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; all variables are static constants and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no data processing or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only initializes constants and class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs; no unusual or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static configuration constants and class attributes defining registry URLs, media types, annotations, and hash values. There are no input sources, data flows, or potential sinks. The constants are standard and do not exhibit malicious intent or behavior. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, containing configuration constants and metadata related to OCI images and registries. It does not include any malicious, suspicious, or maliciously obfuscated code. No security risks or malware are present.",
