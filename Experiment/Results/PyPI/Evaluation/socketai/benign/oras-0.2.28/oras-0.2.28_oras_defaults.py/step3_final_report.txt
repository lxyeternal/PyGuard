{
  "purpose": "Static configuration data defining registry endpoints, media types, annotations, and hash placeholders for OCI images and Docker registries.",
  "sources": "Constants and class attributes assigned static string values; no input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks; code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static definitions with no dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious patterns; straightforward static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constants, class definitions, and metadata related to OCI images and Docker registries. No input, output, or dynamic behavior is present. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected. The code is standard configuration data, with fixed strings and hash placeholders. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are consistent with its benign, static nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration module with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
