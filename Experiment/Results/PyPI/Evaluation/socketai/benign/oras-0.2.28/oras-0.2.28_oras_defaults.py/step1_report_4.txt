{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, configuration classes, and metadata related to OCI image handling, registries, and media types, likely part of a container image management tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data, class attributes, and constant strings. No external inputs or user data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident since the code does not perform data processing or output operations involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code primarily declares constants and configuration settings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation are present. The constants are standard and contextually appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions, constant declarations, and metadata for container image configurations. All data are static, hardcoded values for registry URLs, media types, annotation keys, and default sizes. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic code execution. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The content appears to be standard configuration data for container/image management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration/constants for an OCI container/image management tool. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it perform any operations that could be exploited.",
