  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as static configuration data defining constants, class attributes, and metadata related to OCI images, Docker registries, media types, annotations, and hash placeholders.\n- They explicitly state that there are no input/output handling, no dynamic code, no external data processing, and no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- All reports assign a confidence level of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0, indicating certainty about benign intent.\n- No obfuscation or anomalies are detected across all reports.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining constants and classes without functions, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The fixed hashes are standard placeholders for empty content, commonly used in container image specifications.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The code's purpose is to serve as configuration constants; it does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute code dynamically.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are evident.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward module for defining registry and OCI image metadata.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; static configuration data without any vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, all reports are consistent, and the code is benign. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard static configuration module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable.",
