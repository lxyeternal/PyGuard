{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define utility classes and functions for handling OCI container image manifests, layers, annotations, and configurations.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON files for annotations, reading file sizes and hashes for layers and configs, possibly from user-supplied file paths.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks such as network transmission or file writing are present. The code mostly reads data from files and creates JSON/dict structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input (load annotations, get file size/hash) to in-memory data structures (annotations, layers, manifests). No untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive data exfiltration paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code performs standard data handling and validation with no unusual dynamic code execution or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for managing OCI image components. It uses standard library modules (hashlib, os, json), with file reads and JSON schema validation. There are no network operations, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. The load function in Annotations checks file existence correctly; the rest of the code performs typical data processing tasks. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security exploits.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for managing container image data structures. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe for inclusion in a larger project, with no indicators of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
