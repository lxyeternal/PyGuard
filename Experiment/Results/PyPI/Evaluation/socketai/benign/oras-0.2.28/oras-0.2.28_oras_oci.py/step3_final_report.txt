  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for managing container image layers, manifests, annotations, and configs, including file reading, hashing, validation, and data structure creation.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files (annotations, configs), file paths for blobs, manifest, and config files, and external utility functions for file size and hash calculations.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks; data flows are standard, involving file I/O, hash computation, and JSON validation.",
  "flows": "File existence checks → file reading → hash and size calculation → JSON schema validation → data structure creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions for container image management, with proper error handling and validation. It relies on external safe utility functions. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation present. The logic is straightforward, and the code is well-structured. No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility code for container image components, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
