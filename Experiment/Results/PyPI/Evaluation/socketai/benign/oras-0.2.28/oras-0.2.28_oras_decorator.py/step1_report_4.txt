{
  "purpose": "Provides utility decorators for container handling and retry logic for network requests within a Python package, likely related to container or registry management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function arguments for container identifiers and network responses from requests.",
  "sinks": "Network responses and errors are logged; potential data leakage could occur if sensitive info is leaked through logs, but no explicit sinks for sensitive data are present.",
  "flows": "Input container identifiers are processed through get_container methods, and network request responses are handled in the retry decorator, with error handling and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of retries, logging, and exception handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two decorators: ensure_container modifies function arguments to ensure a container object is provided; retry implements a retry mechanism for network requests, handling specific exceptions and logging errors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network behavior are present. The retry logic uses exponential backoff with retries, which is standard. No signs of code obfuscation or malicious intent are observed. Use of logging and exception handling aligns with normal practices. Overall, the code appears to be standard utility code for network request robustness and container argument validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains standard utility decorators for container handling and network request retries without any malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is legitimate, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
