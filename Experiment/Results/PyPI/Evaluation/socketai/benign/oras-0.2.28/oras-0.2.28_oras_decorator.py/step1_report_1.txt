  "purpose": "Utility functions for container handling and retry logic for network requests in a package related to ORAS.",
  "sources": "User inputs for container identifiers, network responses, and function parameters.",
  "targets": "Network request responses, especially in case of errors, for retries.",
  "flows": "Input container identifiers are processed by get_container, network responses are checked for errors, and in case of exceptions, retries are triggered.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious data handling, or unusual code behaviors. The retry mechanism includes exponential backoff logic, but that is standard. No obfuscated code or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides decorators for container validation and retry logic for network requests. It handles errors by logging and retrying with increasing sleep intervals. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; no data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code uses standard libraries and practices for error handling and retries. No indications of hidden malicious code, malicious data handling, or obfuscation are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module implementing retry and validation decorators with no malicious intent. There are no security risks or malware indications based on this fragment.",
