{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility decorators for ensuring container validation and implementing retries for functions, mainly related to network operations and authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads function arguments, especially 'container' from kwargs or args; uses 'res' from network responses; accesses 'res.json()' and 'res.request.url'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe network response processing, particularly 'res.json()' and error handling, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (container names, function arguments) flow into wrapper functions; network responses (res) are processed, with errors logged and retries attempted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present. Use of retries and error logging are standard practices. No hidden or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators for validation ('ensure_container') and retries ('retry') that handle network request errors, including 500 server errors and exceptions like SSLError or AuthenticationException. It logs errors and retries with exponential backoff. The code only interacts with network responses and local argument validation without any suspicious or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for network communication and input validation. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The functions serve to enhance robustness of network operations without introducing security issues.",
