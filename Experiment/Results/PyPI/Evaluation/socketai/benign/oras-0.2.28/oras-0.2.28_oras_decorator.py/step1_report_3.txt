{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators for container validation and retry logic for network requests in a Python application related to ORAS.",
  "sources": "User input or external data via function arguments, and responses from network requests (res).",
  "sinks": "Network request responses, logging functions, and sleep calls.",
  "flows": "Arguments are validated or transformed in ensure_container; network responses are checked for errors and possibly retried in retry; logs are generated during errors and retries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data leaks; no unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The retry logic involves exponential backoff, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard decorators to validate container inputs and retry network calls with exponential backoff. It handles specific exceptions such as AuthenticationException and SSLError appropriately. Response handling includes error logging and raising exceptions for server errors. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present, and no hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be a typical network utility with error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module implementing input validation and retry logic with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
