  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and determine appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for container validation and retry logic, no malicious behavior, standard practices.\n- **Analysis:** The code validates containers, retries network requests with exponential backoff, handles errors, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2 (low, due to network retries), Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues found. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to retry logic, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility decorators for container validation and retries, safe network response processing.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, handles errors appropriately.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1 (very low), Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No suspicious or malicious activity. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard utility functions, no malicious behavior, handles network errors, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Uses standard practices, no hardcoded secrets, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is typical utility code with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility decorators for container handling and retries, potential data leakage via logs but no explicit leaks.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, standard retry/backoff.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected. The potential for data leakage through logs is a general concern but not specific to malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Decorators for container validation and retries, no untrusted input or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the network retry logic, which is standard but can be misused if misconfigured. However, in this context, they are justified as low risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to network retries, standard practice, minimal risk)\n\nThe code appears to be standard utility functions with no security issues or malicious intent.",
