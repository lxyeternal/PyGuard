{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package by reading metadata and requirements, preparing for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "File reads (version.py, README.md), environment (current working directory), and data from version.py executed via exec().",
  "sinks": "The setup() function, which uses the loaded data to configure package installation; no untrusted data directly affects system security or external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads and the executed version.py into variables, which are then passed to setup(), with no external inputs or outputs beyond standard package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on potentially external or modifiable version.py could be risky, but it is a common pattern for dynamic versioning. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. No network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads static files and executes a version file dynamically, then passes collected data into setuptools.setup() for package configuration. The exec() on version.py could be a vector if version.py is maliciously altered, but this pattern is common in package setups and assumes the integrity of version.py. There are no signs of malware, such as network communication, system modification, or malicious payloads. All data handling appears standard for package setup scripts. No anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration script for packaging Python modules. It does not contain malicious code or malware. The only potential concern is the use of exec() on version.py, which relies on the integrity of that file. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
