  "purpose": "Load version information from 'oras/version.py' dynamically during setup.",
  "sources": "Reading 'oras/version.py' file and executing its content with exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() executes code from 'version.py', which could run malicious code if compromised.",
  "flows": "File read -> exec() -> execution of 'version.py' code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on an external file for version info, which is a known security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code uses exec() to dynamically load version info, which introduces a security risk if 'version.py' is tampered with. No evidence of malicious code or obfuscation is present. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3 to 0.6), reflecting the potential danger of executing external code. The confidence in this assessment is high (~0.7 to 0.9). The code is straightforward and standard for setup scripts, but the exec() pattern is inherently risky. Ensuring the integrity of 'version.py' mitigates this risk.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard but carries a moderate security risk due to the use of exec() on an external file. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main concern is the potential for malicious code execution if 'version.py' is compromised. Scores are appropriately low for malware, moderate for security risk. It is advisable to replace exec() with safer alternatives, such as static imports or parsing version info without executing code.",
