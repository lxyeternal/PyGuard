      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The setup script is standard but carries a moderate security risk due to the use of exec() on an external file. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main concern is the potential for malicious code execution if 'version.py' is compromised. Scores are appropriately low for malware, moderate for security risk. It is advisable to replace exec() with safer alternatives, such as static imports or parsing version info without executing code."
