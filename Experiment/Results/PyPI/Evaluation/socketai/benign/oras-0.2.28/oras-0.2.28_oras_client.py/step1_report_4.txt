{
  "purpose": "The code sets author, copyright, and license information and imports a Registry class as OrasClient for fallback support.",
  "sources": "Author, copyright, license metadata; import statement from a local module (.provider)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import is static and controlled",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward metadata and import statement",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains metadata variables and a single import statement for a local module. The import is a standard fallback mechanism to ensure compatibility of the OrasClient class. There are no input handling, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger package setup without any malicious constructs or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, mainly metadata and a safe import for fallback support. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
