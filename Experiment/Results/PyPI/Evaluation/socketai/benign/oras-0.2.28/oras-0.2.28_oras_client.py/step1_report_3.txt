  "purpose": "Define metadata and import a class for fallback support in a Python package related to ORAS (OCI Registry As Storage).",
  "sources": "Author, copyright, license declarations, and import statement for Registry class from provider module.",
  "sinks": "Import statement, which loads an external class, but no untrusted data or user input handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the import is static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The import is straightforward for fallback support.",
  "analysis": "The code contains metadata declarations (author, copyright, license) and a single import statement. The import is for a fallback support class, which is common in Python packages. No dynamic code execution, no input reading, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, straightforward, and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as fallback support for the package and includes no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
