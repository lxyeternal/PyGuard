  "purpose": "Set package metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__) and provide fallback support by importing the Registry class from a local module, aliasing it as OrasClient.",
  "sources": "Assignment of metadata variables; import statement from local module (.provider).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignments and import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, static, and typical for package setup or fallback support. It assigns metadata variables and imports a class from a local module, with no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. The import is from a trusted, local source, indicating controlled code. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe. It serves as a fallback support mechanism with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
