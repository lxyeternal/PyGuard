{
  "purpose": "Define author, copyright, and license information; import Registry as OrasClient for fallback support in the package.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__); import statement from .provider",
  "sinks": "The import statement imports a module, but no untrusted data or external input is processed or executed here",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata variables and imports a module",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed; the import is straightforward and from a relative module",
  "analysis": "The code establishes metadata variables that are standard in Python packages and imports a class named Registry from a local module for fallback support. There are no dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious patterns. The import statement is typical for modular package structures. No hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard package initialization code providing metadata and a fallback import. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or security concerns detected.",
