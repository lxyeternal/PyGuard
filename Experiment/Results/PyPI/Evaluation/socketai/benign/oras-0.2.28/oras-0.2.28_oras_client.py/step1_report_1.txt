{
  "purpose": "Define author, copyright, license information and import a Registry class for fallback support in a module.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__) and the import statement for Registry from .provider.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no sink that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import is static and from local module.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional, only setting metadata and importing a class.",
  "analysis": "The code sets metadata variables which are standard in Python modules, and imports a class 'Registry' from a local provider module. There are no dynamic executions, no hardcoded secrets, no external data reads, and no suspicious operations. The import is for fallback support, indicating intended resilience. Overall, the code appears benign and consistent with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, standard module header with an import statement. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified, and no obfuscation. It appears safe and purposeful for fallback support.",
