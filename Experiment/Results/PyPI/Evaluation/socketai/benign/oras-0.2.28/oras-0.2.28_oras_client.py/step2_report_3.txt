  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a minimal header with metadata and a straightforward import.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for scores:** No malicious activity or obfuscation, standard practice.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, a minimal setup with metadata and import.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same pattern—metadata and import for fallback support.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns; standard package setup.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same as above.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Consistent with previous reports.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports describe a very simple, static code snippet: setting metadata variables and importing a class from a local module.\n- No dynamic code execution, no input/output handling, no network activity.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no malware.\n- The import is for fallback support, a common pattern in modular Python packages.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.5 or lower. The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 or lower. The code is minimal and safe, but as a general rule, fallback imports could potentially be exploited if the imported module is malicious. However, given the context, the risk remains negligible.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed unless future code introduces dynamic behavior or external data handling.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and does not pose security risks. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese are conservative and align with the observed code characteristics.",
