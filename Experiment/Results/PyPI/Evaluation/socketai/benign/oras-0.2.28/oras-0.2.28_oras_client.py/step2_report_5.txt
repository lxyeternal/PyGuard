  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code with the described issues, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code snippets: setting metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__) and importing a class `Registry` from a local module `.provider`, aliasing it as `OrasClient`.\n- The code is minimal, static, and appears to serve as package setup or fallback support.\n- No dynamic code, user input, external data, or network activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets match the original code provided. The import and metadata variables are present and correct.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; the import is from a local module, likely part of the package.\n- **Security risks:** None evident; no data flows, no external data handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; code is straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports accurately describe benign, standard package setup code. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the scores assigned:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Assessment:**\n- All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- No reason to increase any scores based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- Malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- Security risk is 0, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is standard, safe, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep all scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.  \n- The code is benign and safe as described.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always monitor for future updates or changes, but based on current analysis, this code is safe.",
