  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for container image layers and manifests.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code is static schema definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no processing of untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; schema definitions are static and do not process input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward schema definitions with no dynamic code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines JSON schemas for container image layers and manifests using static Python dictionaries. There are no functions, input/output operations, or data processing. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The schema definitions appear standard and consistent with common practices for validating container images. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, static schema definition script for container image metadata. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no suspicious patterns. The code is safe and appears solely intended for schema validation purposes.",
