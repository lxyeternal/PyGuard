  "purpose": "Define JSON schema structures for manifest and layer schemas used in container image specifications.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; static schema definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; schema definitions are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard schema definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of defining JSON schemas for container layers and manifests, including property types, required fields, and schema metadata. There is no dynamic execution, data input handling, or network interaction. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or potentially malicious logic are present. The structure appears to be standard schema definitions, likely part of a larger project for validation purposes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static schema definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any data processing or communication that could be exploited. Overall, it is safe and benign.",
