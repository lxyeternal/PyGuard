  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for Docker image layers and manifests",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; schema definitions are static",
  "targets": "No data sinks or output functions; purely schema definitions",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static schema structure",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static JSON schema definitions for validating Docker image layers and manifests. It includes schema URLs, property definitions, and schema composition. There are no functions, data processing, or input/output operations. No code injection, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely declarative, intended for schema validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of JSON schema definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain any malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It is safe and intended for validating Docker image structures.",
