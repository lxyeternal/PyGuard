  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for manifest and layer objects related to container images or similar structures.",
  "sources": "Author metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__); JSON schema definitions and property dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; schema definitions are static and do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; schemas are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines JSON schema structures for layers and manifests, including properties like mediaType, size, digest, etc. The metadata variables at the top are merely author and licensing info and do not influence runtime behavior or pose security risks. There are no functions, dynamic code, or external data processing. The schemas are static definitions used for validation, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious code behavior. No obfuscated code, code injection points, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code purely defines data validation schemas for container image components with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a standard schema definition file with no suspicious elements.",
