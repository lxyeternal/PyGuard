  "purpose": "Static JSON schema definitions for Docker image layers and manifests used for validation.",
  "sources": "Schema URL references, static property definitions, author metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__)",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or external interactions present",
  "flows": "None; schemas are static declarations without data flow or execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward schema definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static JSON schema definitions for Docker image layers and manifests, with author metadata variables that are static strings. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors. The schemas are standard, well-formed, and used for validation purposes. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The reports correctly interpret the code as safe, static schema definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static schema definition with no malicious or security implications. The scores and assessments provided are accurate and justified.",
