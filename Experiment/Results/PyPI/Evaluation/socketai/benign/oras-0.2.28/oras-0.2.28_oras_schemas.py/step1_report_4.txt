  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for manifest and layer objects related to container image metadata.",
  "sources": "Code imports, author attribution, schema URL, and property definitions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data output or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to output sinks; primarily schema definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or obfuscated segments identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of JSON schema definitions using Python dictionary syntax. It sets up schemas for 'layer' and 'manifest' objects, including properties and required fields. The schemas are constructed with no dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no external data processing. The author metadata and schema URLs are static, and the overall structure is typical for schema definitions. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward schema definition module with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply models data structures for container images without performing any operations that could harm or compromise systems.",
