  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured cache implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) appropriately reflects the dependency on external update functions, which could be a supply chain concern outside this scope. Malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation at 0, consistent with the code's clarity and safety."
