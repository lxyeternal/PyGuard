  "anomalies": "Unconditional setting of 'OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS' to 'True', which could weaken SSL security but is documented as a workaround.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard initialization tasks for the DIRAC framework, including environment setup, version detection, path calculations, and configuration loading. The setting of 'OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS' to 'True' is a deliberate workaround for SSL proxy certificate handling issues, documented in comments. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The network calls are for configuration validation, not malicious activity. The environment variable change poses a potential security concern but is not malicious or sabotage. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard initialization script with a known workaround involving an environment variable that could impact SSL security if exploited. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score around 0.2-0.3 is appropriate given the environment variable change. Overall, the code appears safe and well-understood, with a minor security caveat due to the environment variable setting.",
