  "conclusion": "The code is a standard initialization script with a known workaround involving an environment variable that could impact SSL security if exploited. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score around 0.2-0.3 is appropriate given the environment variable change. Overall, the code appears safe and well-understood, with a minor security caveat due to the environment variable setting."
