  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs typical resource management within DIRAC, and shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal security concern, mainly due to configuration reliance, which is standard and safe."
