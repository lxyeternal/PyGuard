  "purpose": "Resource management and configuration retrieval functions within the DIRAC framework, including URL construction and resource listing.",
  "sources": "Configuration APIs (gConfig, getSEParameters), helper functions (DMSHelpers, getQueues, getCESiteMapping), and internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "Returned resource lists, constructed URLs, logged warnings and errors.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration and helper functions into internal variables, then to return values or logs; no external network or untrusted data execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious URL manipulations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard resource and configuration management tasks, constructing URLs based on trusted parameters, aggregating resource lists, and handling errors appropriately. No external data flows, code injection, or malicious behavior are present. The URL construction for SRM protocol is straightforward, and the functions rely on trusted APIs. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs typical resource management within DIRAC, and shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal security concern, mainly due to configuration reliance, which is standard and safe.",
