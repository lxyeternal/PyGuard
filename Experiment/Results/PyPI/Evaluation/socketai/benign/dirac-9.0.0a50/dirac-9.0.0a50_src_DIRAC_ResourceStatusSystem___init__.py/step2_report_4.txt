  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code snippets:**\n- All reports describe the code as a single comment indicating the package name \"DIRAC.ResourceStatusSystem.\"\n- No executable code, data input/output, or data flow is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which is reasonable given the minimal content.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The reported issues (or lack thereof) are accurate: the code is just a comment, with no code logic, data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the reasoning of the reports. They correctly identify the code as benign and non-functional.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code being plain comments.\n- Security risk scores are 0, appropriate given the lack of executable content.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is just a comment, there's no scope for malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate.\n- No changes needed for the scores or reasoning.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code snippets are harmless, minimal, and contain no security issues.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (plain comment)\n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, consisting solely of descriptive comments with no security implications.",
