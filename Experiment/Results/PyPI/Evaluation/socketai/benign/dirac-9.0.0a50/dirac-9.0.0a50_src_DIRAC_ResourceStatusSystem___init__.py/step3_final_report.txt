  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist due to the absence of operational code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple comment with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a comment indicating the package name, with no executable statements, data handling, or logic. All reviews confirm its benign nature. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence in this assessment is high (near 1), given the minimal and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign comment with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. No changes to scores or further analysis are necessary.",
