{
  "purpose": "The code manages resource policies by retrieving, filtering, and loading policy configurations based on decision parameters, primarily for resource management within the DIRAC framework.",
  "sources": "Reads decision parameters, configuration data from RssConfiguration, and external modules via ObjectLoader.loadModule.",
  "sinks": "Uses dynamic module loading and logging; no data leaks, network activity, or code injection observed.",
  "flows": "Decision parameters flow into configMatch functions for filtering; matching results determine which policies are loaded and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of dynamic module loading is standard but warrants trusted configuration sources.",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration retrieval, matching, filtering, and dynamic module loading to manage policies. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. The use of ObjectLoader.loadModule is typical for plugin-like architectures within the framework. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's operations and potential operational risks, which are minimal and related to trusted configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard policy management tasks. There are no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware score correctly indicates no malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
