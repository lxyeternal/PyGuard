  "purpose": "The code snippets are purely comments or docstrings indicating package/module structure within the DIRAC framework.",
  "sources": "Comments or docstrings serving as package or module identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external communication, or executable code present; thus, no sinks.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow, as there is no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns; only documentation comments.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippets are non-executable comments describing package structure. All reports correctly identify that these are benign, documentation-only comments with no malicious code, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the content. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are harmless documentation comments with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments in all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
