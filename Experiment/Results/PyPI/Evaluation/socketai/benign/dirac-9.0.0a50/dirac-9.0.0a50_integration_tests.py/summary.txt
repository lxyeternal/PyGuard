  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious activity or obfuscation but has significant security vulnerabilities due to hardcoded secrets and subprocess handling without validation. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious payloads. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is high (around 0.7), mainly because of secret exposure and subprocess risks. Addressing secret management and input validation would mitigate these vulnerabilities."
