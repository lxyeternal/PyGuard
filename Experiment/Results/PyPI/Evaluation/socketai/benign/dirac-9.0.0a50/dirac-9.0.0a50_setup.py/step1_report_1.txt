  "purpose": "The code is intended to facilitate the setup and installation of a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call, which may read configuration data from setup.cfg or other environment sources during installation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to installation directories or reads environment variables during setup, but not directly evident in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration files or environment variables into the setup process, but no explicit source-to-sink flow is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The comment indicates a purpose related to editable installs but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal setup invocation using setuptools. It includes a comment explaining the purpose of the call for editable installs via setup.cfg. The code does not contain any malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. It simply delegates the packaging process to setuptools. No external input or data manipulation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet.",
