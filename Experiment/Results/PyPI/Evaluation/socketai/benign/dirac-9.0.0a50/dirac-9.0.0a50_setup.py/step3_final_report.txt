  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for Python package installation, delegating to setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input, data, or environment variables; the code imports setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no external data or untrusted inputs processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code simply calls setup() with no arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard, minimal setup script with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Python setup script importing setup from setuptools and invoking it without parameters. It relies on external configuration files for package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not process external inputs, connect to networks, or handle sensitive data. Its simplicity and adherence to common packaging practices confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or revision is necessary.",
