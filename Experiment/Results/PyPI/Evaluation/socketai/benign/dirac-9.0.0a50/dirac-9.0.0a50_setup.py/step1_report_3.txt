  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools and setup() invocation",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output operations or external connections",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only imports and executes setup() with no parameters",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard setuptools library and calls setup() with default arguments, primarily for package installation and distribution. The comment indicates support for editable installs via configuration. No data is read from untrusted sources, no external connections are made, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code is minimal and follows typical package setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
