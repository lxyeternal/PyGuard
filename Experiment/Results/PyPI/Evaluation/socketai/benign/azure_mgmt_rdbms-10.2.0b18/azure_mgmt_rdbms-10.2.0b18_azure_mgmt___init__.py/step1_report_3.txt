  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks identified",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ to dynamically load 'pkgutil' is typical, but extending __path__ is a common pattern for namespace packages; no suspicious activity observed",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' using __import__, then extends the __path__ list to support namespace packaging. This pattern is standard for Python packages that span multiple directories. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or data leaks. No obfuscation or unusual control flow is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
