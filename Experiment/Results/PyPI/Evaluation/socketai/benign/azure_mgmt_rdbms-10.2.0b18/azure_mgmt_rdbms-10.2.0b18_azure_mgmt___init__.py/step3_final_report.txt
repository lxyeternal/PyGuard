{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for namespace package support, allowing multiple directories to contribute to the package namespace.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and dynamically imports 'pkgutil' to extend __path__ with __name__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources are involved; the code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "The source (__import__('pkgutil')) flows into extend_path() which modifies __path__, but no external sinks or data leaks occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward, standard pattern for namespace packages with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__ using extend_path, a common pattern in Python namespace packages. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code is simple, standard, and used widely in Python packaging. No untrusted data, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No changes or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
