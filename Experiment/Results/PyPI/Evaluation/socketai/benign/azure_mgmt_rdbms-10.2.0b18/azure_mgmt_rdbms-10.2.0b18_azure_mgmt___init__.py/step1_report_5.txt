  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "None identified",
  "flows": "The code imports pkgutil and calls extend_path with __path__ and __name__, modifying the module's __path__ attribute",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard Python import and module extension method",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the current module's __path__ attribute, which is a standard practice for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The operation is benign and consistent with normal package management procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for namespace package support and does not exhibit any malicious intent or security concerns.",
