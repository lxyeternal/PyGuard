  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package namespace sharing.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkgutil' and using 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions leading to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The code reads module attributes (__path__, __name__) and passes them to 'extend_path' from 'pkgutil'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a common pattern for namespace packages in Python; it involves no hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends the '__path__' variable to support namespace packages. This is a standard practice in Python package management and does not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not process untrusted input, invoke network operations, or perform any system modifications. The simplicity and purpose of this code suggest it is a legitimate module component rather than malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of namespace package extension in Python. It poses no security threats or malicious intent.",
