  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resources.",
  "sources": "The __import__('pkgutil') call dynamically imports the pkgutil module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data is used in a way that causes harm.",
  "flows": "The code imports pkgutil, then calls extend_path() with __path__ and __name__, modifying __path__.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a common pattern for namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module dynamically, then uses its extend_path() function to modify __path__ for namespace package support. This is a standard pattern used to support multi-directory package layouts. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or obfuscated behaviors. The code's structure and purpose are clear and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for supporting namespace packages and poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
