  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support",
  "sources": "Imports 'pkgutil' module and accesses __path__ and __name__ variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "Imports 'pkgutil' -> extends __path__ using extend_path method",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard namespace package pattern, no suspicious logic or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' to modify the __path__ variable, which is typical for namespace packages in Python. It relies on standard language features and library functions without any hidden or malicious behavior. The code does not read external input, execute untrusted data, or perform network operations. No anomalies such as obfuscated code or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a common pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
