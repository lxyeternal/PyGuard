  "purpose": "Supports namespace package extension by dynamically importing 'pkgutil' and extending '__path__'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports 'pkgutil' dynamically.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' -> call to 'extend_path' on '__path__' with '__name__'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__import__' with a string argument is unusual but standard in dynamic imports; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern for namespace package support in Python. It involves dynamic import of 'pkgutil' and extending '__path__' with 'extend_path'. No data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. The use of '__import__' with a string is common in dynamic import scenarios. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with high confidence. Malware scores are 0, reflecting no malicious intent. Security risk scores are very low (0.1), justified by the standard nature of the code. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign pattern for namespace package support with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
