  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ for package resource discovery.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' and usage of __import__ to extend __path__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leak or malicious effect present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' -> execution of extend_path with __path__ and __name__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package resource extension code.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' to extend the module's __path__, which is a standard practice for namespace packages or package resource management. No input/output, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behavior detected. It does not perform any network activity, data storage, or obfuscated logic. It appears to be a typical package setup snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package resource extension using 'pkgutil'. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risk.",
