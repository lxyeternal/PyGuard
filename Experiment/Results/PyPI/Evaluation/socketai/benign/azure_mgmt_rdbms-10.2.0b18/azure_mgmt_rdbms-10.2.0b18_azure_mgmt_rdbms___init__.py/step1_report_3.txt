  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package compatibility and namespace handling.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses its 'extend_path' function to modify '__path__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code reads the '__path__' variable and passes it to 'pkgutil.extend_path'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for package namespace extension; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends '__path__' using 'extend_path', which is a common practice for namespace packages. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or suspicious operations. The code performs a straightforward, benign function related to Python package structure.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a typical and benign package namespace extension. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
