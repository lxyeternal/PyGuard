  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure management test script with security misconfigurations due to hardcoded secrets. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, reflecting the exposure of sensitive information but not malicious behavior. The malware scores are correctly set to 0, and obfuscation scores are 0. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), primarily due to embedded secrets. No adjustments to the scores are necessary."
