  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure SDK test suite with insecure secret handling. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is the presence of hardcoded secrets, which should be replaced with secure environment variables or secret management solutions. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the risk score should be elevated to approximately 0.8 to account for the security implications of embedded secrets."
