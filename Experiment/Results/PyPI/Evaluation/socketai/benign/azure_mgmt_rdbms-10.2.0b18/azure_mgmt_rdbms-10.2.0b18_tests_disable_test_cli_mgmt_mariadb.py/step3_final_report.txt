{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for managing Azure MariaDB resources, including creation, updates, deletions, and querying of resources using the Azure SDK.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded resource names, passwords, storage keys, email addresses, and resource identifiers embedded directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Azure management endpoints with embedded secrets, resource ID string concatenations, and configuration parameters.",
  "flows": "Secrets and resource identifiers flow from hardcoded variables into API request payloads and function calls, with no external input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials such as administrator password ('pass$w0rd'), storage account access key, email addresses, and resource names; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Azure management test suite with embedded secrets, which poses security risks if exposed. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The flow of secrets into API calls is direct, indicating insecure secret handling but not malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscated score is zero. The security risk score should reflect the severity of secret exposure, which is significant but not indicative of malware. The high security risk stems from embedded secrets, which could be exploited if the code is leaked or mishandled.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure SDK test suite with insecure secret handling. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is the presence of hardcoded secrets, which should be replaced with secure environment variables or secret management solutions. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the risk score should be elevated to approximately 0.8 to account for the security implications of embedded secrets.",
