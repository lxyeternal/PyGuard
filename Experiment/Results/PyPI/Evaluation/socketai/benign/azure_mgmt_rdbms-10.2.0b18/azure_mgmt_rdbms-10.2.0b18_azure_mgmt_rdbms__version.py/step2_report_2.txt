  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, containing only a license comment and a single version string assignment. There are no signs of malicious code, data handling, or suspicious behavior. The code is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign, with no suspicious elements. No logical errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security risk:** All assign 0, which is justified given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct. The code is purely declarative with no security implications.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on observable code features. No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk present.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard version declaration with licensing comments, typical for open-source projects. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
