  "anomalies": "Minimal; presence of version string with a beta indicator ('b18') but no other suspicious code or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code only includes comments about licensing and a single assignment of a version string. There are no data inputs, external communications, or sensitive operations. The version string indicates a beta release, but this alone is not suspicious. No malicious or malicious-sounding code elements are present. The code is minimal and standard for a version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to declare the version of the package or module. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
