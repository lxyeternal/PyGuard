  "purpose": "Define the version string for the package or module",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string in the source code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data flow points present",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways identified",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a version string with a 'b' indicating a beta release, which is common and not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment block with licensing information and a single line setting a version variable. No input/output operations, network activity, or suspicious code constructs are present. The license and copyright comments are standard. The version string includes a beta indicator ('b'), which is typical for pre-release versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign declaration of a version identifier with no malicious intent or security issues.",
