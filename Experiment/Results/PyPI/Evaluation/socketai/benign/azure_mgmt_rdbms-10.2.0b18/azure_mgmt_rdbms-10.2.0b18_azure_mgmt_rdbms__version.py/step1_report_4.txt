  "anomalies": "Presence of only version declaration with licensing comments; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a license header and a version string declaration. There are no input/output operations, no data handling, or executable logic that could be exploited or malicious. The version string appears to be a standard release indicator, and licensing comments are typical for open-source projects. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, serving only as metadata for versioning with licensing information. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
