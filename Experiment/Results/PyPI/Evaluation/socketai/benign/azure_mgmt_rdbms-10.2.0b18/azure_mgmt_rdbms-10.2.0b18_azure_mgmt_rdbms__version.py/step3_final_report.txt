  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software component, serving as metadata for version tracking.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the version string to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only assigns a value to a variable without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a beta version indicator ('b18') is typical; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a single assignment of a version string. No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution exists. The version string includes a beta indicator, which is common in pre-release versions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this minimal code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security risks or malicious intent, and the current scoring accurately reflects its safe nature.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
