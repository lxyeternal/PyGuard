{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for handwritten extensions to SDK-generated code, specifically a placeholder function 'patch_sdk' intended for custom modifications.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function does nothing and contains only a placeholder.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mostly comments and a single empty function. No anomalies, suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing and copyright notices, a placeholder function 'patch_sdk' with no implementation, and explanatory comments. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template intended for manual extension of SDK code. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and does not pose security risks.",
