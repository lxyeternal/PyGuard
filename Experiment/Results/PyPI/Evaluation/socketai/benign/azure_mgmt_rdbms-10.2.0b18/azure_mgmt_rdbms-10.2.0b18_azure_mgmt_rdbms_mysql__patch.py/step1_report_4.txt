{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template or placeholder function for patching or extending generated SDK code, specifically for handwritten modifications.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it only contains comments and an empty function definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where untrusted data could be mishandled or lead to leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists since the function is empty and there are only comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The file is a boilerplate-like stub with licensing comments and an empty function meant for user extensions. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are present. The comments and structure are typical of SDK customization points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder for SDK customization with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
