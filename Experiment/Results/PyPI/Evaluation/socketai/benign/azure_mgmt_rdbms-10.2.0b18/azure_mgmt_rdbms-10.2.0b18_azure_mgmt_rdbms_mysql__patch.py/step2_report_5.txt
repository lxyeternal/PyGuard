  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a template or placeholder for SDK customization.\n- The code contains only licensing comments and an empty function `patch_sdk()`.\n- No data processing, input/output, network activity, or external dependencies are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, minimal, and serves as a placeholder for extension. There are no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly interpret the code's purpose and security posture.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Potential adjustments?**  \n  No. The scores seem reasonable and justified based on the code's content.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- **Why is the risk score 0?**  \n  The code does not perform any operations, handle data, or include any suspicious logic. It is a standard SDK extension point placeholder. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n### Malware score:\n- **Should it be higher?**  \n  No. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a benign template.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard placeholder with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores reflect this correctly.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided assessments after careful review.",
