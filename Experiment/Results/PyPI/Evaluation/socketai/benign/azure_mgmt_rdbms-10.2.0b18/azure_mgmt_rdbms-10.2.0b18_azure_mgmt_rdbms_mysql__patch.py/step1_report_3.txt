  "purpose": "The code provides a template for handwritten extensions to SDK-generated code, specifically a placeholder function for patching SDKs.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code does not read any input or data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present; no data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present as there is no data handling or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license headers, comments, and a single placeholder function 'patch_sdk' that performs no operations. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communications. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detectable. The function is a no-op and serves as a placeholder for potential extensions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard, and intended as a template for future customization. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
