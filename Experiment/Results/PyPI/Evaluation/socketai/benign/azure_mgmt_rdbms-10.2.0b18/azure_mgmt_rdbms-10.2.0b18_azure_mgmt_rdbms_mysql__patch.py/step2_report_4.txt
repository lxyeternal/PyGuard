  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code consists solely of licensing comments and an empty function `patch_sdk()`.\n   - No data processing, input/output, network, or system calls.\n   - No dynamic, obfuscated, or malicious code.\n   - Purpose: serve as a placeholder for SDK customization.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Issues:**\n   - **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It is a benign template.\n   - **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws; the code is minimal and standard for such extension points.\n   - **Malicious activity:** None. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n   - **Security risks:** None identified; the code is purely boilerplate.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification:**\n   - The code does not execute any logic, does not handle data, and contains no suspicious patterns.\n   - The purpose is explicitly for extension, which is common and safe.\n   - No signs of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware, as the code is a placeholder.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made or implied beyond the benign analysis.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis code is a standard, benign placeholder used for SDK customization. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n**Note:** The reports are thorough and consistent with the code. No further action or concern is warranted.",
