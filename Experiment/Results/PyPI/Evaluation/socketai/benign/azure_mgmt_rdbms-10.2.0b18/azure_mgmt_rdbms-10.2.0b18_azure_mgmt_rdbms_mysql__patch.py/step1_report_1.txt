  "purpose": "This file appears to be a template or placeholder for handwritten extensions to generated SDK code, specifically for patching or customizing the SDK.",
  "sources": "There are no input sources or data reads in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or operations that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists as the code does not process any data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a licensing comment and an empty function definition with no implementation or logic. No anomalies or suspicious activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing information and an empty function stub intended for custom patches. It does not process or handle any data, does not perform network operations, file access, or system calls, and contains no dynamic or obfuscated elements. Its purpose is clearly for extension points in SDKs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a placeholder or extension point with no malicious intent or security issues. It poses no threat and is safe to use.",
