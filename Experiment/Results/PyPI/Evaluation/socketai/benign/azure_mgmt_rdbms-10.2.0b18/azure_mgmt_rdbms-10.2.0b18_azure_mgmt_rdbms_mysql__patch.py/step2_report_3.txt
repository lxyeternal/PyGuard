  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \n- The code is a minimal, boilerplate stub with licensing comments and an empty function `patch_sdk()`.  \n- No data processing, external input, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present.  \n- No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious code structures are evident.  \n- All reports correctly identify it as a benign placeholder for SDK extensions.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as a benign template with no malicious or security issues.  \n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.  \n- The reports' confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n- Malware score: all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated score: all assign 0, which is correct.  \n- Security risk: all assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.  \n- These scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n- The code does not perform any operations that could pose a security risk.  \n- No external data handling, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent are evident.  \n- Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n**5. Malware Score Analysis:**  \n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.  \n- No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities:**  \n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they recognize the code as a template or placeholder.  \n- No unwarranted claims are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n- The scores are consistent and justified based on the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard SDK extension placeholder with no malicious or security issues.**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimates align with the reports:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, non-obfuscated, and poses no security risk. The reports are accurate and thorough. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that such placeholder code remains unmodified in production environments to prevent accidental introduction of malicious or insecure code.",
