  "purpose": "Placeholder function for SDK extensions, intended for user customization.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static code with no input or external data processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function is empty and contains no logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with licensing comments and an empty function.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign template with licensing comments and an intentionally empty function 'patch_sdk()'. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or contain obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as a harmless placeholder with no malicious behavior or security issues. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious SDK extension placeholder with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scoring and assessments are accurate and justified.",
