{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a template or placeholder for customizing or extending an SDK, specifically for handwritten modifications.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; the code does not contain input functions or data fetching mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where data could be leaked or manipulated, as the code does not process any untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the function 'patch_sdk()' is defined but contains no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive licensing and copyright comments, but no executable or suspicious logic. The function 'patch_sdk()' is empty, serving as a placeholder, which is typical for customization hooks.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a boilerplate with licensing info and an empty function intended for SDK patching or extension. There are no dynamic operations, data processing, or external dependencies present. It does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious code. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template used for SDK customization, with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior. It functions as a placeholder for user-defined extensions.",
