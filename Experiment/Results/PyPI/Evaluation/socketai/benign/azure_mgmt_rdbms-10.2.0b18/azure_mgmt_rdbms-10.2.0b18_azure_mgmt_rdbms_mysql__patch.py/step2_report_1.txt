  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a placeholder or template for SDK extensions, with no data processing, external input, or malicious activity.\n- The code is static, contains only licensing comments and an empty function.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or signs of malware are present.\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code is straightforward and minimal; no errors or issues are present.\n   - The function `patch_sdk()` is intentionally empty, serving as a stub for user extension.\n   - No logic flaws or security issues are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no data flows, no external inputs, and no malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly interpret the purpose as a placeholder/template.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The `risk` score is also 0, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any risk that warrants a score above 0.5.\n   - The code is non-executable, non-intrusive, and purely a template.\n\n5. **Malware score justification:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This aligns with the absence of malicious behavior, code injection, or payloads.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on factual observations of the code.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — the code is a benign placeholder with no malicious elements.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — the code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk is present.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward SDK extension stub, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the reports' findings and supports the conclusion that the code is safe and benign.",
