  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package compatibility and dynamic loading.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses '__import__' to load it, then calls 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or output data.",
  "flows": "The code imports a standard library, retrieves the module's path extension, and assigns it back to '__path__', with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. Usage is standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends the module's search path, which is common in namespace package setups. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic is involved. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern used for namespace packages, with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
