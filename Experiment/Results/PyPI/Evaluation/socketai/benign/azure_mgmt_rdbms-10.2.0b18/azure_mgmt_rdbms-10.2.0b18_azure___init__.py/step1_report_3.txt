{
  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package namespace support",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and accesses the built-in __path__ variable",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink identified",
  "flows": "The code modifies __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path, which is a safe operation",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and performs a standard package namespace extension; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls 'extend_path' to modify the __path__ variable, which is a common pattern for namespace packages in Python. It does not process user input, read external data, or execute any untrusted code. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The operation is standard and intended for package structure management.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a legitimate and common package namespace extension without any malicious intent or security risks.",
