  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package discovery",
  "sources": "Uses __import__('pkgutil') to dynamically load the pkgutil module, then calls extend_path with __path__ and __name__",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data is sent, received, or written to external sources",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies __path__ for package extension, with no data flow beyond the package path extension",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module using a dynamic import statement, then calls 'extend_path' to modify the module's __path__ attribute, which is typical in namespace packages to include multiple directories. This is a standard pattern in Python packages for supporting namespace packages. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, is present. The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling indicate no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation used in Python namespace packages to extend their search path. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
