  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages in Python by extending __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' module and use of extend_path() function.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call extend_path() on __path__ with __name__.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a standard, straightforward pattern with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and extends __path__ for namespace package support, a common and documented pattern. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard operation with no malicious intent. No external inputs, network activity, or data sinks are involved. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package extension pattern in Python, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
