  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ attribute to support namespace packaging",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkgutil' and accessing '__path__' and '__name__' variables",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Imports 'pkgutil', then calls 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__'",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'extend_path' to modify '__path__' is standard for namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' to support namespace packages, which is a common pattern in Python for modular packages. It does not involve any data input, network operations, or manipulation of untrusted data. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious intent are apparent. The code is minimal and follows standard practices for package extension.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is used to extend the package's search path for modular packages.",
