  "purpose": "This script configures the setup process for a Python package named 'azure-mgmt-rdbms', including extracting version information and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a file, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description, and obtains environment data for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "Uses data read from files (version, readme, changelog) directly in package setup; no untrusted data flow to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Reads version data from a file, then passes it into setup() without modification; no external or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious variable names or unusual code patterns. The code reads version info and package data in a standard, safe manner.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup routines: reading version info from files, validating presence, and configuring package metadata. It does not execute or evaluate untrusted data. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. It follows common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely reads version information and metadata for package configuration.",
