  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Standard package setup.  \n- Sources: Reads version info from a file, documentation files for description.  \n- Sinks: No untrusted data flows, no code execution, no network operations.  \n- Anomalies: None observed; straightforward, conventional code.  \n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no suspicious logic.  \n- Conclusion: Benign setup script.  \n- Malware score: 0 (correct).  \n- Security risk: 0 (correct).  \n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, package setup.  \n- Sources: Reads version info, documentation files.  \n- Sinks: No untrusted data flows or external commands.  \n- Anomalies: None; standard practice.  \n- Analysis: No malicious activity, straightforward code.  \n- Conclusion: Benign.  \n- Malware score: 0 (correct).  \n- Security risk: 0 (correct).  \n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Sources: Reads version info, documentation files.  \n- Sinks: No untrusted data or network activity.  \n- Anomalies: Uses regex for version extraction, but from static files—standard practice.  \n- Analysis: No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard setup script.  \n- Malware score: 0 (correct).  \n- Security risk: 0.1 — slightly above zero, but given the absence of any malicious behavior, this small score seems to reflect the regex parsing but does not indicate real risk.  \n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Standard package setup.  \n- Sources: Reads version info, documentation files.  \n- Sinks: Static data, no untrusted data or network activity.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior, straightforward logic.  \n- Analysis: No signs of malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Benign setup script.  \n- Malware score: 0 (correct).  \n- Security risk: 0 (correct).  \n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to others, package configuration.  \n- Sources: Reads version info, documentation files.  \n- Sinks: No external or untrusted data flows.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, no obfuscation.  \n- Analysis: Standard, safe practices.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.  \n- Malware score: 0 (correct).  \n- Security risk: 0 (correct).  \n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is straightforward.  \n- **Malware score:** All zero, consistent with the code content.  \n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in one report (0.1), but justified by regex usage, which is common and not malicious here. Overall, the risk remains very low.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- The malware scores are appropriate.  \n- The obfuscated score is correctly zero.  \n- The security risk score of 0.1 in report 3 is reasonable given the regex parsing, but it does not indicate any real security concern.\n\n### Overall estimated scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the minimal regex usage, but not indicating any real threat)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and the scores are justified. No further action needed.",
