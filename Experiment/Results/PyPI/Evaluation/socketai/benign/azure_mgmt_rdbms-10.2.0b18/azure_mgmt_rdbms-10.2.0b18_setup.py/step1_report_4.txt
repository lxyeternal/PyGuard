{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution on PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a version file, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description, and gathers package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the script primarily reads static files and sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> sets package parameters -> configures package setup with static and file-based data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The version extraction logic is standard; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version information from a version file, reads static markdown files for documentation, and invokes setuptools.setup() with predefined parameters. All operations involve reading known files and setting package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external untrusted sources are involved during execution. The code follows standard packaging procedures and contains no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It reads static files and version info, and configures package metadata without any malicious or suspicious activity. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
