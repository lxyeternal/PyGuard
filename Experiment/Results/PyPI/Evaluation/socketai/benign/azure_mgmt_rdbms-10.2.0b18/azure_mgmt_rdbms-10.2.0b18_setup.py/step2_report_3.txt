  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, reads version info, documentation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0, justified.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is accurate. No code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard package setup routines.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n- **Comments:** Correct. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script, with a note on the regex used for version extraction.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Justification for security risk:** Slightly higher, possibly due to regex parsing, but this is standard and safe.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is accurate. The small security risk score is acceptable given the regex use, but it's not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard package setup, no untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n- **Comments:** Correct assessment. No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, straightforward setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. All reports correctly identify the script as a benign setup routine.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated in one report (0.1) due to regex parsing, but this is benign.\n\n### Final expert evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to the regex, but not a real security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately scored. The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code with minimal, justifiable concern regarding the regex usage.",
