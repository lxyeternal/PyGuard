{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library, reading version info, documentation, and configuring dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from static files, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md for descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or code execution present.",
  "flows": "Static file reads for version and documentation; no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex for version extraction from static files, which is standard practice; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup activities with static file reads and package configuration. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input is present. The regex used for version extraction is straightforward and operates on static files, posing no security risk. The code structure and practices align with standard, benign setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup file with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a minimal security risk score of 0.1 (due to regex parsing) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
