  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package for distribution, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a file, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description, and gathers package files via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; no execution of untrusted code or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version data from a file (source) and uses it in setup() (sink); reads documentation files (source) for package description.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically reads version information from a file within the package directory, using regex to extract the version string. It then reads README and changelog files for detailed descriptions, which are combined for the long description. The setup() function is called with metadata and dependencies, with no external or untrusted data sources. No network operations, code execution, or sensitive data handling are present. The package dependencies are well-defined, and the package structure excludes test directories and certain packages to maintain integrity. Overall, the script performs legitimate setup activities without suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It performs typical setup tasks without any signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. No anomalies or malware are present.",
