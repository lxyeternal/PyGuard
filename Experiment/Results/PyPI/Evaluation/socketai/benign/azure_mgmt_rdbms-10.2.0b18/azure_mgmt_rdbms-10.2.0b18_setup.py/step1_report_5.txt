  "purpose": "Setup script for configuring and packaging the 'azure-mgmt-rdbms' Python library, including version extraction and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a version.py or _version.py file; reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files; reads package and dependency configurations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; uses static data for package setup. No data is sent over network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Reads version data from files -> assembles package configuration -> invokes setup() with static info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. The version extraction uses regex but from static files only.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static file reading for version info and package metadata. It uses standard practices for Python package setup. No indications of malicious activity or obfuscated code. No network, system modification, or hidden behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks detected based on code content. It appears safe and standard.",
