  "purpose": "This script interfaces with a PlantUML server to encode UML diagrams and retrieve their images, supporting various authentication methods and file processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input files containing PlantUML markup; reads environment variables for proxy configuration; receives network responses from the PlantUML server.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to the PlantUML server; network responses containing images or error content; writes images and error pages to disk.",
  "flows": "Reads UML source files -> encodes and sends requests to server -> receives image or error content -> saves output files.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses standard encoding and compression methods; no suspicious hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. Proxy configuration via environment variables is standard. No suspicious network domains or payloads are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical client for a UML diagram rendering service, supporting authentication, proxy setup, and file processing. It performs encoding of UML text, makes HTTP requests, and writes output images and errors. Environment variables are used for proxy configuration, which is standard. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The exception classes are straightforward and related to network errors. The network requests are to a known public server. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate client for interacting with a PlantUML server. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. The overall security risk is very low.",
