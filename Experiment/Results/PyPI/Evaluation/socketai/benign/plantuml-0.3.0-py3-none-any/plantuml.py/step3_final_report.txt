  "purpose": "Client utility for encoding UML diagrams and interacting with a PlantUML server, supporting optional authentication and proxy configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads input UML text files, environment variables for proxy settings, network requests to the server.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to the PlantUML server, writing PNG images and error HTML files.",
  "flows": "Reads UML source files -> encodes and compresses data -> sends HTTP requests -> receives image data or errors -> writes output files.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables for proxy configuration; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation; standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate encoding and network communication for UML diagram generation. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. Proxy setup via environment variables is standard. Authentication is optional and handled securely. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are detected. The error handling and file operations are straightforward. The overall behavior aligns with a benign utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward client for generating UML diagrams via a PlantUML server. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal concern due to network interactions but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious features.",
