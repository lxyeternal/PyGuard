{
  "purpose": "The code generates plantuml diagram images by interacting with a plantuml server, supporting various authentication methods and file processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input from files specified via command line arguments; retrieves environment variables for proxy configuration; reads data from input files.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests to a plantuml server; writes output images and error pages to disk; encodes data for server requests.",
  "flows": "Reads UML markup from files -> Compresses and encodes data -> Sends HTTP request to plantuml server -> Receives image data -> Writes image or error files to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; usage of environment variables for proxies is typical; no obfuscated code or misleading variable names; exception classes for error handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily facilitates communication with a plantuml server for diagram generation. It includes standard error handling and optional authentication via basic or form login, with environment-based proxy configuration. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection is evident. The code's structure is conventional and aligns with common practices for such utilities. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malware-like activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate utility for generating images from plantuml markup via a server, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to typical design patterns and does not contain malicious or suspicious code components.",
