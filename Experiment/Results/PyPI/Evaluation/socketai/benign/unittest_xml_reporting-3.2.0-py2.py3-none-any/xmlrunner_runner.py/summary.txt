  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test infrastructure component with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score (~0.2) reflects typical user-controlled file handling but does not indicate security issues. Malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal."
