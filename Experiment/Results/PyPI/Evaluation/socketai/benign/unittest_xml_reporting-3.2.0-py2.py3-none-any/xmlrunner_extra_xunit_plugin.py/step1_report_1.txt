{
  "purpose": "To perform XML transformation using XSLT on provided XML data.",
  "sources": "The function reads XML data from the 'xml_data' parameter; the transformation is performed on this data.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the transformed XML output to a BytesIO stream and returns it; no external sinks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'xml_data' -> parse to XML document -> apply XSLT transformation -> write output to memory -> return output bytes.",
  "anomalies": "The XSLT explicitly suppresses certain attributes ('file', 'line', 'timestamp') by matching and skipping them, which may indicate obfuscation or data suppression; no malicious code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads an XSLT stylesheet that removes specific attributes from XML documents and applies this transformation to input XML data. It uses standard libraries and straightforward processing. No external calls, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The removal of specific attributes could be for privacy or data cleanup, but alone does not indicate malicious intent. The implementation appears to be a typical XML processing routine with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard XML transformation removing specific attributes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a benign utility for XML processing.",
