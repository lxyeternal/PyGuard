  "purpose": "Transform XML data using an XSLT stylesheet that strips certain attributes from test cases.",
  "sources": "xml_data parameter in the transform() function, input to etree.XML()",
  "sinks": "Result output written to io.BytesIO, returned as bytes",
  "flows": "xml_data → etree.XML() → TRANSFORM → result.write(out) → return out.getvalue()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The XSLT appears straightforward, copying most nodes except specific attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an XSLT stylesheet intended to omit certain attributes ('file', 'line', 'timestamp') from 'testcase' elements in XML. The transform() function loads XML input, applies the stylesheet, and returns the transformed XML as bytes. No external data sources, command execution, or network activity are present. The code appears to be a benign XML transformation utility, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe XML transformation utility that filters out specific attributes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a straightforward XML processing task without any suspicious or malicious code.",
