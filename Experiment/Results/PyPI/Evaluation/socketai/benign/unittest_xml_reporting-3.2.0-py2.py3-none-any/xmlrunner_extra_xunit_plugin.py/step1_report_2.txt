{
  "purpose": "The code applies an XSLT transformation to an input XML document, removing specific attributes and copying the rest.",
  "sources": "xml_data parameter passed to the transform() function, which is user-controlled XML input.",
  "sinks": "Result of the transformation written to an in-memory BytesIO object, returned as output.",
  "flows": "xml_data is parsed from external input; the transformation is applied; the output is generated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lxml.etree.XSLT with a static stylesheet appears benign; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports lxml.etree and defines a static XSLT stylesheet that removes specific attributes from XML elements. The transform() function parses input XML data, applies the stylesheet, and returns the transformed XML. The stylesheet is static and designed solely for XML manipulation; it does not include dynamic code execution, network access, or other malicious behaviors. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. The logic is straightforward and solely focused on XML processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard XML transformation with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors.",
