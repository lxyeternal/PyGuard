{
  "purpose": "To perform an XML transformation using a predefined XSLT stylesheet.",
  "sources": "The code reads input XML data via the xml_data parameter in the transform() function.",
  "targets": "The code outputs the transformed XML data as bytes, returning it from the transform() function.",
  "flows": "xml_data (source) -> etree.XML parsing -> XSLT transformation -> io.BytesIO output -> return bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The XSLT is straightforward, copying most nodes except specific attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports io and lxml.etree, defines a static XSLT transformation, and applies this transformation to input XML data. The XSLT removes specific attributes ('file', 'line', 'timestamp') from 'testcase' elements and copies the rest of the nodes. No dynamic code execution, no external data fetching, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The code functions purely as an XML transformer, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard XML transformation utility that removes certain attributes from specific nodes. It appears benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
