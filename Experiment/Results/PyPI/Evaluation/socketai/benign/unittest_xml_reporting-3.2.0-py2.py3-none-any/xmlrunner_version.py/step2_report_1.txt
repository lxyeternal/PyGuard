  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- The code is minimal, standard, and contains no input/output, data flow, or executable logic.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity are suggested or detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**1. Code Content Verification:**\n- The code is `__version__ = '3.2.0'`.\n- No other code, data input, output, or behavior is present.\n- **Confirmed:** No issues or malicious behavior are present.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes in Reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify this as a benign version string assignment.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n- **No corrections needed.**\n\n**3. Score Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified given the straightforward nature.\n\n**4. Higher Risk Scores?**\n- No reason to assign any risk higher than 0 here; the code is standard.\n\n**5. Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n- All claims are based on the minimal code snippet, which is accurate.\n- No assumptions are made beyond the observed code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the consistent, minimal, and benign nature of this code, I concur with the existing scores.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard version string assignment, common in Python packages, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No data flow, input, or output indicates any security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed benign.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity detected.",
