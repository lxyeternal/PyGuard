  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ variable, indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no input/output, data flow, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the minimal and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
