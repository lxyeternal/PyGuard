  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple version string assignment: `__version__ = '3.2.0'`.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or code execution paths.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The code is standard practice in Python packages for versioning.\n\n**Confirming code presence:**\n- The code `__version__ = '3.2.0'` is present in all reports.\n- No discrepancies or missing code snippets are noted.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is justified.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since the code only assigns a version string, there's no reason to assign any higher risk.\n- The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is suggested.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code.\n- No vulnerabilities are claimed or implied beyond the code's actual content.\n\n**Score consistency:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code snippet and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as harmless. No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.",
