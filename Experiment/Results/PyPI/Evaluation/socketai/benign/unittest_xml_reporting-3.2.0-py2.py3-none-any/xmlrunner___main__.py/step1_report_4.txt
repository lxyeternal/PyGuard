  "purpose": "Main entry point for executing XMLTestProgram, customizing sys.argv for help messages.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.executable (reads executable path), os.path (reads filesystem info)",
  "sinks": "sys.argv (potentially modifies command-line args), os.path.basename (reads executable name)",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> XMLTestProgram (indirect, via command-line invocation), sys.executable -> os.path.basename -> sys.argv modification",
  "anomalies": "Modification of sys.argv[0] for display purposes is benign; no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules and a test runner, then alters sys.argv[0] if invoked via __main__. It changes the display name for help messages to a cleaner executable name. The modification is superficial and intended for usability. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The only activity involves reading the executable path and adjusting argv, which is typical for CLI scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a benign test runner entry point with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly alters command-line display behavior for better user experience.",
