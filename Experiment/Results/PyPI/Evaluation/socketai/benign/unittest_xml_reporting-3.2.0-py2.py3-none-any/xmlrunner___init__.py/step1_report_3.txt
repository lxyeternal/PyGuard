  "purpose": "The code serves as a module that provides version information and a class for XML test running, based on a default TextTestRunner.",
  "sources": "Import from .version (__version__), import from .runner (XMLTestRunner).",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive operations; primarily imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info and a test runner class from local modules, then defines __all__ for exports. There are no dynamic evaluations, network operations, or data handling from untrusted sources. The comments clarify the module's purpose, and the structure appears straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module providing version and test runner class definitions. It shows no malicious intent or security issues based on this fragment.",
