  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward: it imports a version string and a test runner class from local modules, then exposes them via `__all__`.\n   - No input handling, data processing, network calls, or untrusted data sinks are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and functionally simple.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as simple and standard.\n   - They note the absence of suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or misleading claims are evident.\n   - **Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and justified; no change needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations.\n   - **Conclusion:** The risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is correctly assigned as 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n   - **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard module with no suspicious or malicious features. The reports are accurate and consistent, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. No adjustments are necessary. The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and poses no security risk.",
