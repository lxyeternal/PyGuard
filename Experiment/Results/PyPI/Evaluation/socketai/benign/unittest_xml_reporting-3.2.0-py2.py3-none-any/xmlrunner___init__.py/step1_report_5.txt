{
  "purpose": "The code defines module metadata and imports for a testing framework, specifically providing version information and the XMLTestRunner class.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.version' and '.runner' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, only imports and exports of module attributes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely imports and exposes classes and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The version import could be a point of concern if maliciously manipulated, but there's no indication of that here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and a test runner class from local modules, then defines what symbols to export. It contains no user input handling, network activity, or execution of untrusted data. The content is straightforward and typical for Python package modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard part of a testing framework package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected based on the provided code.",
