  "purpose": "This module provides a version string and a test runner class for testing purposes, serving as an interface or configuration component.",
  "sources": "Imports __version__ from .version and XMLTestRunner from .runner",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Import of version and test runner, then exposing them via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string and a test runner class from local modules, then defines __all__ for exports. It contains no input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is simple, clear, and typical for a Python module defining exports, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or security-sensitive operations. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, with high confidence. No adjustments are necessary.",
