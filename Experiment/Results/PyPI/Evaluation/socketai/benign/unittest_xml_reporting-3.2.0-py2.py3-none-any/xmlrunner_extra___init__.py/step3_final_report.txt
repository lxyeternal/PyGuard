  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file operations, network communications, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, dynamic code execution, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into eval/exec, network functions, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, obfuscation, dynamic imports, complex nested structures, environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code contains dynamic execution functions like eval/exec with untrusted data, and exhibits obfuscation. These are suspicious indicators of potential malicious intent. The presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution increases the likelihood of malicious behavior, but without concrete evidence, it cannot be confirmed. Other code appears benign, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. The overall structure suggests moderate suspicion, especially in code employing eval/exec and obfuscation techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious payloads, but lacks definitive malicious activity. The malware score is set at 0.3, reflecting moderate suspicion. The obfuscation score is high at 0.7 due to the complexity and obfuscation indicators. The overall security risk is moderate at 0.4, warranting cautious review before deployment.",
