  "purpose": "Provides a framework for generating XML test reports with hierarchy, counters, timestamps, and sanitization to ensure valid XML content.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for test case names, content, counters, and system time functions for timestamps.",
  "sinks": "XML element and attribute creation, insertion of sanitized content into CDATA sections and attributes.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into XML elements and attributes, sanitized via replace_nontext, then assembled into the XML document hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal sanitization only replaces non-text characters; does not fully sanitize for malicious XML injection or crafted content, but no malicious code or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard XML report builder with hierarchy management, timing, counters, and sanitization. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. Sanitization via replace_nontext prevents invalid XML characters but does not fully prevent crafted malicious content. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or external dependencies. The timing functions and content insertion are benign. The sanitization approach is typical but not foolproof against all XML injection vectors. Overall, the code is well-structured, secure for its purpose, and the lack of malicious activity justifies a malware score of 0. The risk score is low (around 0.2), considering potential misuse of input content, but no active threats are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured XML report generator with minimal sanitization. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external threats are detected. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
