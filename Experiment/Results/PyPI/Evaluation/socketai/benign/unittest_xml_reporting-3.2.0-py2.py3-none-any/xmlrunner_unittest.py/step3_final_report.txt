  "purpose": "Re-exports selected components from Python's unittest framework for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, and various unittest modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Imports from standard library to __all__ declaration; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export of standard modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, ensures compatibility with __future__, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely structural, facilitating testing setup or modularization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0, reflecting the code's harmless nature.",
