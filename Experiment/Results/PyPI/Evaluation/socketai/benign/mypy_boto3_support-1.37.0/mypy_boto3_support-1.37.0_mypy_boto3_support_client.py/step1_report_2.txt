  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface for the AWS Support service client, providing methods to interact with support cases, attachments, and trusted advisor checks.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external libraries (sys, typing, botocore), and the class method implementations that call AWS support APIs via boto3.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows through method parameters (kwargs), especially in methods like generate_presigned_url and add_attachments_to_set, which could handle external input; however, these are standard API calls.",
  "flows": "Input data from method arguments flows into AWS API requests; presigned URL generation involves Params and HttpMethod. No evidence of malicious flow, as data handling appears standard.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hidden network connections, or code executing dynamic code. Use of type annotations and method wrappers is standard. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a typed interface for the AWS Support client using boto3 and botocore, with method signatures matching AWS API endpoints. It imports standard libraries, conditionally imports based on Python version, and defines exception classes. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or suspicious logic is observed. The presence of methods for presigned URL generation and API calls is typical for SDK wrappers. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be a well-structured, standard SDK interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface for AWS Support with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It is purely for defining method signatures and exception handling for support-related operations. No signs of supply chain attacks or malware.",
