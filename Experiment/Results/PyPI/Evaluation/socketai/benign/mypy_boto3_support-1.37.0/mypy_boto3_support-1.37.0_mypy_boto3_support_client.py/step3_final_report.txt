  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 Support Client, serving as a static SDK stub with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (kwargs), imported modules, class attributes, and documentation links.",
  "sinks": "Data passed into SDK methods via kwargs; responses are typed; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SDK method calls; responses are returned as typed data structures; no malicious or unsafe data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with type annotations, method signatures, and documentation references. It does not contain dynamic code execution, network operations, or data manipulation. All signals indicate a benign, static interface serving as a type stub for AWS Support SDK. The malware scores are correctly zero, and obfuscation is absent. The risk scores are slightly elevated in some reports due to potential misuse of inputs, but this is inherent to SDK wrappers and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious SDK stub providing type annotations for AWS Support. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The high risk scores in some reports are unjustified and should be lowered to reflect the benign nature. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use.",
