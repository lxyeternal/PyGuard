  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 Support Client, enabling static type checking and IDE support for AWS Support service interactions.",
  "sources": "Configuration and setup sections, import statements, class and method definitions, property declarations, and docstrings that reference AWS SDK documentation.",
  "sinks": "Methods that accept untrusted input via **kwargs and pass them to boto3 API calls, potentially leading to misuse if inputs are maliciously crafted, though these are standard SDK calls.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into SDK methods via **kwargs, which are unpacked into request types; responses are returned as typed outputs. No unsafe execution or code injection appears present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code found. The code consists mainly of type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a strongly typed interface for the AWS Support client using Python type hints, including method signatures, properties, and exception classes. It relies on standard boto3 and botocore modules, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data manipulation that could indicate malicious intent. The presence of documentation links and standard SDK wrappers suggests legitimate usage. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The overall structure aligns with typical SDK interface definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type-annotated interface for the AWS Support SDK client, designed for static analysis and IDE support. It contains no malicious code or security risks, serving purely as a type definition layer. The risk of misuse hinges on the inputs passed to the SDK methods, which is outside the scope of this code itself.",
