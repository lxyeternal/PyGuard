  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and interface definitions for boto3 Support Client, referencing documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Inputs are passed via **kwargs into SDK calls; responses are typed. No unsafe execution or code injection.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK interface with no malicious intent. It serves purely as type annotations and method signatures.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.95 — appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Inputs are via kwargs; no evidence of malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK wrapper, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 1 — justified, as the code is a typical SDK stub.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines support client with exception types and methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are through method parameters; no untrusted data sources or malicious flows evident.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK interface, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — very low, aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations and wrapper methods for AWS Support.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard API calls; no evidence of malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, legitimate SDK wrapper.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations and method signatures for support client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow from untrusted sources; purely structural.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK stub, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, as no obfuscation or hidden code patterns are present.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a set of type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 AWS Support client.\n- No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data manipulation that could be malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking and IDE support.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, just a standard SDK interface)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate. The code is a legitimate, non-malicious SDK stub providing type annotations for AWS Support.",
