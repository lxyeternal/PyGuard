  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations for the boto3 Support client, referencing documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Inputs are passed via **kwargs into SDK methods; no unsafe execution or code injection.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK interface with no malicious intent; purely type annotations and documentation references.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.95 — justified given the high confidence that this is a benign SDK stub.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, focusing on type annotations and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard API calls with untrusted data passing through method parameters; no evidence of malicious flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 1 — appropriate, given the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations and class definitions, similar to previous reports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are typical for SDK interfaces; no suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK stub code, safe and legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.95 — consistent with findings.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, method signatures, referencing AWS SDK documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Method parameters may accept untrusted data, but this is normal for SDK wrappers.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical, safe SDK interface code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 1 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on type annotations and API method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of malicious data flow; standard SDK pattern.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, benign SDK wrapper code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently report 0. Given the code's nature—type annotations and SDK interface wrappers—there's no indication of malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, no network activity, no code injection, no hardcoded secrets.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports report 0, which aligns with the code's clarity and straightforward structure.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are high (around 0.9–1) mainly because the reports consider the potential for untrusted input in API calls. However, these are standard SDK interface definitions, not executable code with logic that could be exploited. The risk here is minimal and primarily depends on how the SDK methods are used externally, which is outside this code's scope.\n\n**Overall Recommendation:**\n- The code is a standard, well-typed SDK stub/interface for AWS Support.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The high risk scores are somewhat conservative but understandable given the potential for misuse via untrusted inputs, not because of malicious code.\n\n### Final conclusion:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect that misuse of the interface could pose some minimal security considerations, but the code itself is safe)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
