  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, code integrity, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a type annotation interface for boto3 Support Client. No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Inputs are standard request types; no dynamic execution or data manipulation.\n- **Anomalies:** None; standard SDK interface.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, purely type definitions, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.95.  \n  *Justification:* The high risk score seems excessive given the absence of any malicious or risky behavior. It's a static interface with no runtime logic.  \n  **Suggested adjustment:** Reduce risk score to 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining support client methods, with standard imports and no suspicious code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are standard API calls; no malicious flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK interface, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1.  \n  *Justification:* The maximum risk score is unjustified. Static SDK stubs pose no security threat.  \n  **Suggested adjustment:** Reduce risk to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, type annotations for AWS Support SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK interface, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n  *Justification:* Slightly above zero risk score, perhaps considering potential misuse, but since it's purely interface code, this is marginal.  \n  **No change needed, but could be 0.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, type annotations, method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are standard; no external data leakage.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe SDK wrapper.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n  *Justification:* Similar to previous, risk score is minimal and acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, standard support client interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, safe SDK stub.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n  *Justification:* Consistent with other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly indicate 0, as no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly indicate 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  - Reports 1 & 2: Currently at 0.95 and 1, respectively, which are unreasonably high for static SDK interface code. These should be lowered to 0.  \n  - Reports 3, 4, 5: At 0.1, which is acceptable for such interface code but could also be 0.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Keep at 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  - For Reports 1 & 2: Lower from 0.95/1 to **0**.  \n  - For Reports 3, 4, 5: Keep at **0.1** or reduce to **0** if desired.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS Support. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present. The high risk scores assigned to some reports are unjustified given the static, interface-only nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0      (or 0.1) |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1 (or 0) |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1 (or 0) |\n\n**Note:** The risk scores for the last three can be fine at 0.1, reflecting minimal concern, but for the first two, a zero risk is more appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, serving as a type stub for AWS SDK support client. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The high risk scores are unwarranted and should be adjusted downward.",
