  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the mypy-boto3-support package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input, network, or environment variables are used in a malicious manner.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file and passing static parameters to setup(), with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The script follows standard Python package setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with static, predefined metadata. No code injection, environment variable misuse, or malicious logic present. The only external input is the static README.md content, which is safe. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
