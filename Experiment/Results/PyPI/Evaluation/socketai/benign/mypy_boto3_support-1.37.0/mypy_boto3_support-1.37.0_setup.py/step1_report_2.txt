  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-support Python package",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no network, file write, or environment variable manipulation present",
  "flows": "No malicious or suspicious data flow from source to sink; setup metadata is static",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup functions: reading a markdown file, importing setuptools, and defining package metadata. There are no dynamic or malicious code constructs, no external data sources, and no suspicious behavior. All dependencies and metadata are static strings and variables. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data leakage present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and standard for package distribution.",
