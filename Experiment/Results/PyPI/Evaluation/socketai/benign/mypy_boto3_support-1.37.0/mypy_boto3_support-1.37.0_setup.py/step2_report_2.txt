  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted data sources, user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is a common and safe practice.\n- The package metadata, dependencies, and URLs are static strings, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n**1. Code correctness and issues:**\n- The code correctly imports necessary modules (`pathlib`, `setuptools`) and reads the README.md file.\n- The `setup()` call uses static, well-formed parameters.\n- No issues or errors are evident in the code.\n\n**2. Logical flaws or mistakes:**\n- The code follows standard packaging practices; no logical flaws are present.\n- The `install_requires` uses a conditional dependency on `typing-extensions`, which is correct and common.\n\n**3. Malware, obfuscation, and risk scores:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**4. Justification for scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n**5. Potential assumptions or claims:**\n- All claims are based on static analysis, which is appropriate here. No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a typical, benign setup script with no security concerns. All scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Risk           | 0               |\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the detailed review.",
