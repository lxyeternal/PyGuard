  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-support package to configure its installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and imports from pathlib and setuptools modules.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or dangerous operations present.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content for description; uses standard setup function for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file to set the long description. It imports necessary modules and calls the setup() function with static package metadata. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code structure is typical for a Python package setup script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only external interaction is reading a local file, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
