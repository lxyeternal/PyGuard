  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-support library.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; static data used, no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Static data passed directly to setup(), no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, conventional setup script with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py file, importing standard modules, reading a local file, and calling setup() with static parameters. No user input, environment variables, network operations, or dynamic code execution are involved. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to best practices. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. All data is static and safe. The provided reports uniformly conclude the script is benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which aligns with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign Python packaging file with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
