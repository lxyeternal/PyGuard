{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging the mypy-boto3-support Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the file system to load README.md for long description; imports standard and setuptools modules; static strings for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; static strings and file reads are safe.",
  "flows": "Reads a file for long description -> passes static data into setup() parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pathlib to read a local README.md file for long description. It uses setuptools.setup() with static package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. The code structure is standard for package setup, with no obfuscated patterns or malicious constructs. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, data leakage, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
