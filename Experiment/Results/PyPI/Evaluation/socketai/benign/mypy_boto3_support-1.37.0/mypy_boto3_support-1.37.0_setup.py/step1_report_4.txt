{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-support package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Path to README.md file for long description, hardcoded package metadata (name, version, author, etc.), external URLs and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks involving untrusted input or data leakage points; package data and install requirements are static and hardcoded.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script only reads a local file and defines static package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward and follows standard setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and the setuptools package to configure a Python package. It reads a local README.md file for description, and defines package metadata, classifiers, URLs, dependencies, and other configuration options. All data appears static, with no user input or dynamic execution that could introduce malicious behavior. There are no obfuscated elements, unusual constructs, or external data sources that could be malicious. The code performs standard package setup operations consistent with legitimate use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only defines package configuration and reads a static file for description, which is typical for Python package distribution.",
