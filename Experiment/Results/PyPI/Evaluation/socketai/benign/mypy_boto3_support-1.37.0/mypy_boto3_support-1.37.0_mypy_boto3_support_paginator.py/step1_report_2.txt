{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for support service client paginators, facilitating type-safe usage of the boto3 support client.",
  "sources": "Reading from sys.version_info, importing sys, importing typing modules, importing botocore.paginate, importing local type_defs, and optional type extension imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform dangerous actions; only standard type annotations and class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly defines classes and type annotations for paginator usage.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports based on Python version, but no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines paginator classes for the boto3 support client, with appropriate type annotations. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, extends base classes, and documents methods with links. There are no signs of code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and focused on typing and documentation. No external input handling or insecure operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard type annotation module for boto3 support client paginators. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The only potential concern could be if the imported type_defs are malicious, but this is outside the scope of this module. Overall, the code is safe.",
