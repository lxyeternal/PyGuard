{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for support service client in boto3 with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions. Also conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling, user input, or external data processing.",
  "flows": "The code defines classes and methods for pagination, mainly handling data returned from AWS support service. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The conditional import for Unpack and the use of type hints are standard for type-annotated Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type-annotated paginator classes for AWS support service using boto3, with careful version-dependent imports and type checking. It extends existing classes and defines paginate methods with type hints. No external data sources, no unsafe code, and no suspicious logic are present. The structure is consistent with standard boto3-stubs code for type safety enhancement. No obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-annotated Python module for boto3 support service pagination, aimed at improving type safety. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The code appears legitimate and safe.",
