  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines typed paginator classes for AWS Support, importing type definitions, sys for version checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing; mainly class definitions and type annotations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard use of conditional imports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, well-structured type annotation module for boto3 support paginators. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.95 (high confidence in safety).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar in purpose—providing type annotations and paginator classes with safe, standard practices.\n- No suspicious behavior, no external data handling.\n- The only potential concern is the imported `type_defs` module, but that’s outside this code’s scope.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 1 (full confidence in safety).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, defining paginator classes with type safety, using conditional imports.\n- No external data processing, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar structure, no suspicious patterns, no external data flows.\n- Focused on static type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same observations—standard class definitions, no external data or malicious code.\n- Uses version checks appropriately.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely static, defining classes for boto3 support paginators with type annotations.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. The code does not execute external commands, process untrusted data, or contain obfuscated/malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** The code is a typical type annotation module, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Risk scores are high (close to 1) because the reports conclude the code is benign, and the code itself is straightforward and safe.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, safe, well-structured static type annotation module for boto3 support paginators.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is present.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (very low, as the code is purely static and documentation-oriented)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe.
