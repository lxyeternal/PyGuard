{
  "purpose": "Define typed paginator classes for AWS Support service, enabling type-safe pagination of support cases and communications.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from 'type_defs', imports sys for Python version checking, and utilizes sys.version_info and TYPE_CHECKING for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The code mainly defines classes and methods with static type annotations.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining classes that inherit from generic Paginator types, and their paginate methods accept kwargs with specific type annotations, returning PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of conditional imports based on Python version is standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes paginators for AWS support using boto3-stubs for type annotations. It uses conditional imports to ensure compatibility across Python versions. The classes extend from Paginator with specified response types and provide paginate methods with proper type annotations. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or sensitive operations are present. The implementation appears to be standard, type-safe, and aligned with typical SDK practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, well-structured definition of typed paginator classes for boto3 support service. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The design is standard for type annotations and SDK compatibility, with no suspicious anomalies.",
