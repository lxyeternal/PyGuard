{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3 support service client, facilitating paginated API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; reading of sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; mainly class inheritance and method definition with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for conditional import is standard, not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; code primarily static type hints and class structures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines paginator classes with type annotations for support API calls, including conditional imports based on Python version. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there sink points that could leak data or execute malicious actions. The code lacks dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. Its purpose is to improve static type safety and documentation support for boto3 support service, with no indications of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static type annotation module for boto3 paginators. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and appears to be a legitimate part of a type hinting library for AWS support service pagination. No security risks or malware are detected.",
