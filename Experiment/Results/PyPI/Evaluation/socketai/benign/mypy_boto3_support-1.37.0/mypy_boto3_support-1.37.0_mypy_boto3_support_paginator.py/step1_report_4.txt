  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Support service client, facilitating paginated API calls with type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class method parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or external calls within the code itself.",
  "flows": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs with specific types, returning PageIterator objects, but no external untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is primarily type annotations and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with type annotations for support service AWS API calls. It conditionally imports Unpack for Python >=3.12 and assigns base classes based on TYPE_CHECKING. The paginate methods accept typed keyword arguments and return PageIterator instances. No data processing, network communication, or external data handling occurs within this code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or anomalies are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type annotation module for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and class definition module for boto3 support paginators. It contains no malicious, suspicious, or security-threatening features. It is safe and intended for type checking support in AWS SDK contexts.",
