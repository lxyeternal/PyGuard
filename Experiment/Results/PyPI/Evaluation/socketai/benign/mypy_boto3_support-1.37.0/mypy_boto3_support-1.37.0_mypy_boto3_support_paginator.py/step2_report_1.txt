  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a set of class definitions for paginators, primarily adding type annotations and documentation.\n- It uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external data processing, or security-sensitive operations.\n- The code relies on imported type definitions from 'type_defs', which could be a vector if malicious, but outside the scope here.\n- All reports consistently identify the code as standard, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Presence Confirmation\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security issues.  \n  **Confirmed:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the purpose of the code as defining typed paginator classes with proper version handling.  \n  **No flaws identified.**\n\n### Score Evaluation\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0 or 0.95 (some mention 0.95 in the overall confidence). Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n### Justification for Higher Risk Scores\n- No reason exists to justify a risk score higher than 0. The code is static, documentation-oriented, and does not perform any insecure operations.\n\n### Claims Based on Assumptions\n- No suspicious claims are made; all assessments are based on code analysis, not assumptions.\n\n### Consistency of Scores\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The only potential concern could be the imported 'type_defs' module, which might contain malicious code. However, since this is external and outside the provided code snippet, it cannot be assessed here.  \n- The code itself is standard, well-structured, and serves a documentation and type annotation purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk. The high confidence scores in the reports are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- Confirm that the code is benign and suitable for production use as part of a type-safe SDK.",
