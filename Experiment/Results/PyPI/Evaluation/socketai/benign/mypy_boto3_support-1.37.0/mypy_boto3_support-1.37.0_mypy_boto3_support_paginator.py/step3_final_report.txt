  "purpose": "Define typed paginator classes for AWS Support service, providing type annotations and documentation for better developer experience.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and external type_defs module; version info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; class methods accept kwargs for pagination, but these are type-annotated and controlled.",
  "flows": "Class definitions extend from generic Paginator types; paginate methods pass through kwargs to underlying boto3 calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected. Conditional imports are standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured static module providing type annotations for boto3 support paginators. It uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility, defines classes extending from generic Paginator types, and includes documentation links. No runtime or external data processing occurs, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The reliance on external 'type_defs' is outside the scope but assumed benign. The code serves purely as a type-safe wrapper for documentation and developer assistance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, non-malicious, and standard for SDK support modules. All indicators point to a benign, static implementation with no security risks or obfuscation. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
