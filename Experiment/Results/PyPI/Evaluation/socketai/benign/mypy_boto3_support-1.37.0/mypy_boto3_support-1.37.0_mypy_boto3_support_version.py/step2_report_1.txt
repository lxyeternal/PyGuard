  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their assessments:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple, static version declaration.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or dynamic code are involved.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code indeed contains only a variable assignment `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"` and a comment. No other logic, input, or external dependencies are present.\n- **Malicious elements:** None detected; the malware score is 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** None, as there's no dynamic or unsafe code.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only point of contention is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, this is not malicious but perhaps a typo or placeholder.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 is appropriate; no security risk.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The reports assign a confidence of 1.0 (or 0.9 for the last one), which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n- The anomaly regarding the future year does not warrant an increased risk score, only noting as a possible typo.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security issues. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed. The code is safe, clear, and serves its purpose as a version identifier.",
