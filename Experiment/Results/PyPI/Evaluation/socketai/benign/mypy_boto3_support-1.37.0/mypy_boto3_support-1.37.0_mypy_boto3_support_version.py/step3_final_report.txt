  "purpose": "Defines the version of the software package as a static string.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data; the version string is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment of version string.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string with a comment. No dynamic code, inputs, or external dependencies are present. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The only anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security but may be a typo. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in these assessments is high (1.0), with a slight reduction (0.9) in one report due to the future year anomaly, which is minor and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no security issues or malicious intent. The only notable point is the future copyright year, which is unlikely to be malicious but should be corrected if it is a typo. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and non-malicious.",
