  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; simple static assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version variable with a hardcoded string. The copyright notice is a comment and does not affect execution. There are no input sources, data handling, or dynamic code execution. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for version declaration. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
