  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their assessments and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a minimal, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.\n- The only noted anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__`. There are no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Are there any logical errors?**  \n  No. The code is simple and correct for its purpose.\n- **Are there any misinterpretations?**  \n  No. All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Confidence:**  \n  All reports have confidence scores of 1.0 (except report 5, which is 0.9). Given the simplicity, this seems reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  All are 0, which is accurate.\n- **Malware:**  \n  All are 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Security risk:**  \n  All are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Anomalies:\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025).  \n  While unusual, it doesn't pose a security risk or indicate malicious intent. It might be a typo or placeholder.\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly conclude there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Correctly 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Correctly 0; code is clear.\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern but might be worth correcting for clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a simple, standard version declaration with no security issues.  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n- No changes needed unless the future year is corrected.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; consider updating the copyright year if it's a typo.",
