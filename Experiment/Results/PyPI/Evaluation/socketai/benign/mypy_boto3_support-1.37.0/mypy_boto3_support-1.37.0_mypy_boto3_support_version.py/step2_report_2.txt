  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions and scores are appropriate, considering the code's simplicity and the information provided.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- All reports agree that there are no data flows, inputs, or external dependencies.\n- No suspicious or malicious code elements are present.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Straightforward version declaration, no anomalies.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to report 1, notes the future date.\n- **Score justification:** All zeroes, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward, no anomalies.\n- **Score justification:** All zeroes, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, minimal code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** All zeroes, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar, notes the future year as an anomaly.\n- **Score justification:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9) due to the anomaly, but no malware or security risk.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly conservative but reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 1, with report 5 at 0.9 due to the future copyright year anomaly.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The future copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious. It could warrant a minor concern, but not enough to increase malware or security risk scores.\n- The confidence score for report 5 could be slightly increased to 1, given the anomaly is not malicious but perhaps a typo.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the future date anomaly, but it's negligible)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe original reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a standard version declaration with no security issues. The minor anomaly (future year) does not justify any change in the malware or obfuscation scores.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0.\n- Set securityRisk=0 (or 0.1 if considering the future date as a minor concern).\n- Confidence=1.\n\nThis code is a typical, safe, and non-malicious version declaration.",
