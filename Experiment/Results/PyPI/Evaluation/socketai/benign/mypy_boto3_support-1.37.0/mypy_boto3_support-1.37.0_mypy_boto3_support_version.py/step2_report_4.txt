  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- There are no inputs, external data, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The only noted anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code is straightforward, no anomalies, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=1.0`\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the future date (2025) is noted but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Same as above, `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=1`\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Same as above, `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=1`\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Correct; straightforward version declaration.\n- **Scores:** Same as above, `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=1`\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence (`0.9`) due to the future copyright year, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Still `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`. The anomaly does not justify a higher risk.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; the anomaly is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring consistency:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The malware score is 0 across all, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscation score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate, with the only slight dip in report 5 due to the future date anomaly, which is minor.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and the analysis, I concur with the provided scores. I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe only point of note is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard version declaration with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
