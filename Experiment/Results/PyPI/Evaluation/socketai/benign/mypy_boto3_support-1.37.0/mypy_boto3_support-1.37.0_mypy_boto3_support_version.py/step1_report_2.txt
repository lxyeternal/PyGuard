  "purpose": "Defines the version of a package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string \"1.37.0\" to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only a static assignment occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string for a package, with a comment indicating it's the source of truth for versioning. It contains only a version declaration with a comment and no other logic, data input, or external dependencies. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The copyright date is 2025, which is in the future, but this does not indicate malicious intent; it may be a placeholder or a typo.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to declare the package version. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
