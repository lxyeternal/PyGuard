  "purpose": "Defines the version of a software package or module.",

  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with a future year (2025), which is inconsistent or potentially suspicious, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice with a future year, and a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__. No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no use of external libraries. The future copyright year is unusual but does not indicate malicious intent; it may be a typo or placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely an error or placeholder, not malicious.",
