  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n- It uses standard Python modules (sys).\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree on benign nature and correctness.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the description and analysis in all reports.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- None detected. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No issues warrant a higher risk score; the code is benign.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Confirmed as 0; no malicious activity or signatures.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about untrusted data or external dependencies; the analysis is accurate.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent, assigning 0 to obfuscated, malware, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code and reports, **the scores are appropriate and accurate**.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (benign, static CLI output)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, safe CLI utility.\n- No issues detected.\n- Scores are justified and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is entirely benign with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
