  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs package information or version based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`), specifically checking for '--version'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to standard output (`sys.stdout.write`).",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (`sys.argv`) leading to either `print_version()` or `print_info()` output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only `sys`, defines two functions (`print_info()` and `print_version()`) that output static, hardcoded strings, and a `main()` function that checks for '--version' in `sys.argv`. It performs simple command-line argument parsing and outputs information accordingly. No external data, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The code is minimal, clear, and typical for a CLI info script. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code's behavior is consistent with its purpose, and all reports correctly identify it as benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.",
