  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward CLI utility.\n   - No external network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The code only reads command-line arguments and outputs static information.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Implementation:**\n   - The code imports only `sys`.\n   - Defines two functions: `print_info()` and `print_version()`, which output static strings.\n   - The `main()` function checks for `--version` in `sys.argv` and responds accordingly.\n   - The overall structure is simple, standard, and free of complex or risky operations.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The code functions as intended for its purpose.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n   - **Security risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or risks detected.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - All reports correctly assume the code is benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are unjustified; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform risky operations.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n   - The scores assigned (all zeros) are reasonable.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the reports. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Score | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0       | No malicious activity or code patterns detected.           |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.           |\n| Security Risk     | 0       | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or risky operations.      |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and poses no security risks.",
