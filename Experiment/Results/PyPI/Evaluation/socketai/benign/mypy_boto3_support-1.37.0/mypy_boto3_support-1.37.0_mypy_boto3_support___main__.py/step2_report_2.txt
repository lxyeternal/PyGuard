  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that:\n     - Checks if \"--version\" is in `sys.argv`.\n     - If yes, prints the version.\n     - Otherwise, prints package info.\n   - It uses only standard Python libraries (`sys`) and outputs static, hardcoded strings.\n   - No external data sources, network activity, or untrusted input processing beyond command-line argument checking.\n   - No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is minimal, clean, and typical for a CLI info script.\n\n2. **Report Analysis:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the script is benign, with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks.\n   - They consistently note the absence of obfuscation, external network activity, or data leaks.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, indicating high certainty in these assessments.\n   - The malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate given the absence of any malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The overall security risk score of 0 aligns with the findings.\n   - The reports' scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The code is very simple; there are no hidden behaviors or complex logic that could hide malicious intent.\n   - The reports are thorough and agree on the benign nature.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here, as the code doesn't process untrusted data or perform risky operations.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, the package is safe.\n   - The scores reflect the actual analysis accurately.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis is a benign CLI script with no security concerns.",
