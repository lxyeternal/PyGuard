{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for a package related to boto3 support, providing version and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv; writes output to sys.stdout",
  "targets": "Outputs version and package info to stdout based on command-line input",
  "flows": "User input (sys.argv) → if condition checking '--version' → print_version or print_info → stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or malicious code; straightforward functionality. No suspicious network activity or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and focused on CLI output, with functions to print package info and version. It checks for '--version' argument and responds accordingly. There are no external data sources, no user input other than command-line arguments, and no suspicious behaviors such as file access, network communication, or data manipulation. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for a CLI tool. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware signatures detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script for displaying package information and version. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
