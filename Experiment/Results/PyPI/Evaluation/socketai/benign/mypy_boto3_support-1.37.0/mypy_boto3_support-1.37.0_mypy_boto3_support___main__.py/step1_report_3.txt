  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint that displays package information or version based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input; sys.stdout.write for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv flows to conditional logic, leading to output via sys.stdout.write.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and executes main() which checks command-line arguments. If '--version' is present, it outputs the version; otherwise, it outputs package info. The logic is straightforward, with no external data handling or untrusted inputs beyond sys.argv, which is standard. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that displays static package information and version. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
