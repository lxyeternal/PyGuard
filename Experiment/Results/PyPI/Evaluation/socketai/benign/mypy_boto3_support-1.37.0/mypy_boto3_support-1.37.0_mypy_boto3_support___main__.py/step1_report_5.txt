{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point that provides package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 support.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from sys.argv to determine command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to sys.stdout via sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "If '--version' is present in sys.argv, it calls print_version() and outputs version info; otherwise, it calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns are present. The code's functionality appears straightforward and intended for informational output. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple CLI argument checking and outputs static information related to the package. It does not process or handle untrusted data beyond the command-line argument check. There are no external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors. The code structure and logic are clear, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script intended to display package info and version. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
