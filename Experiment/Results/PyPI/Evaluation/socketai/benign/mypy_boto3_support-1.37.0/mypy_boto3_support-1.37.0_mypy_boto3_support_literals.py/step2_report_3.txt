  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a collection of static string literal type definitions for AWS support services, resource names, and paginator identifiers.\n- It uses conditional imports for `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility.\n- All variables are simple, static string literals assigned to type aliases.\n- There are no dynamic data flows, user inputs, external data sources, or runtime code execution.\n- No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The purpose is purely to provide type annotations for static type checking and IDE support.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type literals for support service names and paginator identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that the code is static, benign, and for type hints only.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining support service name literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is static, with no dynamic behavior or security concerns.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Score of 0, which is justified.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines support resource and paginator literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly notes that the code is purely static and safe.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Score of 0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines support service name and paginator literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the code as straightforward static definitions.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Score of 0, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines support resource identifiers and paginator names.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is static, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Score of 0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking Scores:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the code content.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0 in all, which is correct.\n- The `confidence` is 1, which is appropriate given the static, well-documented nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **No presence of malicious code, malware, or obfuscation.**\n- **No dynamic or external data handling that could introduce security risks.**\n- **The code's sole purpose is to define static type literals, which is a benign pattern.**\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, given it's purely static type annotations, but I assign a minimal risk score to acknowledge that static code can sometimes be misused if misrepresented; however, in this case, it's clearly benign).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a straightforward, static type annotation utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the reports correctly identify its benign nature.",
