  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various support service names and paginator identifiers used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, and definitions of string literals for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects data leak or system behavior; purely type annotation definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; code only declares constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines various string literal types representing support service names, paginator names, and resource service names for type annotations. It includes a detailed list of supported strings, but no dynamic execution, no external data inputs, and no malicious behavior. The purpose is to facilitate static type checking and documentation. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected; all elements serve a documented purpose aligned with type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-documented set of type annotation definitions intended for static typing support. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
