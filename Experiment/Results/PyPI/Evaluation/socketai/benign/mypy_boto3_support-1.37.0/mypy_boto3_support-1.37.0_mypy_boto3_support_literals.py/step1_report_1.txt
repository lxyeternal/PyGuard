  "purpose": "Define type literals for support service names and paginator identifiers used in boto3 support client interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and type annotations; assignments of Literal types for various support service identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks; only static string literals are defined.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely defines constants and types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic behaviors; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type annotations for various support service identifiers, enabling type checking and IDE assistance. The conditional import handles compatibility with Python versions, which is standard. There are no inputs, data processing, or outputs involving untrusted data. All literals are predefined strings representing AWS service names or paginator identifiers, with no code that executes or manipulates data dynamically. No potential security issues, malware, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module solely defines string literal types for AWS support services and pagination identifiers, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign type annotation utility module.",
