  "purpose": "Define string literal types for support service resource identifiers and paginator names, facilitating type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions, conditional import of Literal based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external or untrusted sources to sensitive operations; mainly type annotations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and primarily consists of type annotations and static literal definitions.",
  "analysis": "The script provides type annotations for specific string literals used as resource and paginator names within a support service context. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard practice. All the defined variables are static string literals assigned to constants, serving as type-safe identifiers. No input handling, no dynamic execution, no external data sources, and no side effects are present. The code appears to be a purely static, type hinting utility module. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for type annotations related to AWS support service literals. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The use of conditional import is standard for compatibility. Overall, the script is safe and purely informational.",
