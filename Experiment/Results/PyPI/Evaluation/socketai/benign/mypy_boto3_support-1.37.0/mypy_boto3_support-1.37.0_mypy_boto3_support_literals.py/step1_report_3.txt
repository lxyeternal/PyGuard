  "purpose": "Define type literals for support service names and paginator identifiers to facilitate type checking and code clarity in AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing modules, and the definitions of string literal types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static type definitions do not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions serve as type annotations only, without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version. It then defines multiple string literal types representing AWS support service names, paginator names, resource service names, and a combined paginator name type. The purpose is to facilitate type safety and documentation for AWS SDK usage. No dynamic code execution, input processing, or data handling occurs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; the code is purely declarative type annotation code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign set of type definitions intended for static type checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard pattern for type hinting in Python projects using AWS SDKs.",
