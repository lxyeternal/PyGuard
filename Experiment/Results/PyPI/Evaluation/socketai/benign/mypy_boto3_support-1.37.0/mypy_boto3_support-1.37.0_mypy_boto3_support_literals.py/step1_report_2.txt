  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS support service literal values, used for type checking in Python code interacting with AWS support APIs.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions assigning string literals to variables, import statements for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data flows are present. No data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code solely defines constants; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script imports type annotations conditionally based on Python version, then declares multiple string literal types and constants representing AWS support and resource names. It uses only safe, static string assignments with no dynamic execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious logic. The code's purpose is purely to provide type hints for other code modules. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static collection of string literal type definitions for AWS support service components. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
