  "purpose": "Defines static string literal types for AWS support services, resource names, and paginator identifiers to facilitate static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "String literals assigned to type aliases, imported conditionally based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static definitions only.",
  "flows": "None; purely static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static type alias definitions for various AWS service identifiers, with conditional import for 'Literal' to ensure compatibility across Python versions. It contains no dynamic code, data processing, or external data handling. The purpose is solely to provide type safety and improve code clarity. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and serves as a static utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type annotations. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are accurate and justified.",
