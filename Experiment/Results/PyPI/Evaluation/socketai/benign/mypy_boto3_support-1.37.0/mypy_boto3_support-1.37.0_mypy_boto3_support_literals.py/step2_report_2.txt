  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a collection of static type annotations defining string literals for AWS support services, resource names, and paginator identifiers.\n- There are no data flows, input handling, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The code includes conditional imports for compatibility, which is standard.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.\n- The purpose is purely to provide type safety and documentation support.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0. Given the code is purely static type annotations with no external data or execution, this seems appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports are consistent in their reasoning, and their conclusions are aligned with the code's nature.\n- The detailed lists of string literals do not introduce any security concerns.\n- The conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version is standard and safe.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are reasonable; no changes needed.\n- The reasoning is sound, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis matches the reports' conclusions. The code is a benign utility module for static type annotations.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. They correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, safe, static type annotation utility, with no security concerns.",
