{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for support service data structures used in the boto3 AWS SDK, mainly to facilitate type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, Python version info, and type definitions. No external input sources or data inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to security vulnerabilities. The code only defines data types.",
  "flows": "Since this code is purely type definitions without executable logic or data processing, there are no source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are detected. The code uses standard type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and documented docstrings. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of Python type annotations and data structure definitions for use with boto3 support services. It uses conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions, defines various TypedDicts representing request and response data structures, and leverages standard Python typing practices. The code is well-structured, documented, and aligns with typical type definition files. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are evident. It solely serves as type information for development assistance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious type definition module intended for type checking support in boto3 support service SDK. No malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are detected.",
