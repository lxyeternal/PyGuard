  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and overall conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines type annotations for AWS Support API responses and requests.\n- **Analysis:** The code is purely static type definitions, no runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured, standard for type checking.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the analysis. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for support service data structures.\n- **Analysis:** No external input, no data sinks, no runtime logic, just static type definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, non-malicious, standard type annotations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS Support SDK data structures.\n- **Analysis:** No executable logic, no data processing, no external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely type annotations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for support service data structures.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime code, external communication, or data processing. Use of conditional imports is standard for compatibility.\n- **Anomalies:** None; the only unusual aspect is the copyright date (2025), which might be a placeholder.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard type definitions, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough; the future date is likely a placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS support API.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, external data handling, or executable code.\n- **Anomalies:** The only notable point is the copyright year (2025), which is in the future.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard data structure definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware presence. The code is purely static type annotations with no executable or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of runtime logic, external data handling, or security concerns, a risk score of 0.5 or higher would be unjustified. All reports correctly assign 0.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for the AWS Support SDK.\n- No runtime, external, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus that the code is benign, purely for static type checking, and free of security risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. No changes needed. The code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
