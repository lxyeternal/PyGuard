  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states that the code defines type annotations for AWS Support API responses/requests. No external data sources or runtime data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or data flow issues; purely static type definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or obfuscated code; no secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard for static type checking, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The confidence is high (1), and malware risk is zero.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign, well-structured type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focusing on type annotations for boto3 AWS SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing; no data flows that could cause vulnerabilities.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard use of typing_extensions for compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behaviors; purely type annotations for static analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** No security concerns; purely benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines data structures for AWS Support SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are only within type annotations; no runtime or external data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; standard type definitions.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, standard, and non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous; detailed type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing; only static type annotations.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of conditional imports is standard; no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Assessment:** Benign, well-structured type info.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines API data types for support service.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing or runtime logic.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual aspect is the copyright date \"2025,\" which is in the future and possibly a placeholder or typo. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely structural, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** No security risks; likely a standard SDK type definition file.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscated patterns.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0; the code is clear, with standard conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of runtime logic, external data handling, or secrets, the risk score remains at 0.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nAll reports agree that this code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS SDK support services. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a safe, standard type definition module with no security concerns.",
