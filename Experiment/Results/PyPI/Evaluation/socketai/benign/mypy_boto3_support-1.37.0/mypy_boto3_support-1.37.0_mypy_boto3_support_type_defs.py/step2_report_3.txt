  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, logical consistency, and appropriateness of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining type annotations for AWS Support responses/requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows—just static type definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard for static type annotations, with no malicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Verdict:** Fully reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code defines types for boto3 support services.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies detected; standard practices used.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, purely type annotations.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as type definitions for AWS SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely for static type checking, with no malicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; defines type annotations for support service data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors; conditional imports are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign type definition module, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; type definitions for support API interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual aspect is the copyright date \"2025,\" which is in the future—likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely structural, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, purely static type annotations.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) are all justified as zero.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with standard practices.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured type definition module for AWS Support SDK, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The only minor anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future. This is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security issue.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.",
