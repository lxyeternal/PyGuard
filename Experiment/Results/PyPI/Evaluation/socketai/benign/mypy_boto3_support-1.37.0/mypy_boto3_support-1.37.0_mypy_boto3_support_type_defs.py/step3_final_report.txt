{
  "purpose": "Defines static type annotations and data structures for AWS Support SDK interactions, including requests, responses, and related data types.",
  "sources": "No runtime data sources; purely static type definitions imported and used for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data processing occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Static type annotations used for static analysis; no runtime data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year '2025', likely a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for compatibility. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or data processing. The conditional import patterns are standard for cross-version compatibility. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The code's purpose is to facilitate static type checking for AWS Support API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of static type annotations for AWS Support SDK data types. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is unlikely to be malicious.",
