  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious or suspicious behavior, logical consistency, and alignment of scores with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS Support API responses/requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or runtime data processing; purely static type definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-structured, standard type annotations with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for support service data structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing; purely type definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, non-malicious, serves as static type info.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for AWS SDK support data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks; static data structures.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured, purely for type safety.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for support API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime or external data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; standard practice.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly benign, purely for static type checking.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for support service API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or execution.\n- **Anomalies:** Slight note on the copyright year (2025) being in the future—possibly a placeholder, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard type definitions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is solely static type definitions for AWS support service SDKs.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** None identified; the code does not process runtime data, perform network operations, or contain any executable logic.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, the code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scoring is appropriate.",
