{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions for support service API responses and requests, facilitating type safety and documentation for AWS support SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "The code defines various TypedDict classes and constants, mainly for data structure definitions, and imports from standard and third-party libraries for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions; the code is primarily type definitions and structural annotations.",
  "flows": "The code defines data structures used to represent API inputs and outputs; there are no runtime data flows or processing logic, thus no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses conditional imports for compatibility, but this is standard practice and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The inclusion of a copyright date in 2025 is unusual but likely placeholder or typographical.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for defining data types using Python's type hinting and TypedDict constructs. It imports necessary modules, manages compatibility across Python versions, and declares a large set of data structures for support service API interactions. No runtime logic, code execution, or external system interaction is present. The code does not handle untrusted input nor perform data processing; it solely specifies data formats.\n\nNo signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The presence of licensing and documentation comments is standard. The only potential anomaly is the copyright year (2025), which is in the future and might be a placeholder.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be a benign, standard set of API data type definitions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions for AWS support service responses and requests, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It is purely structural, aimed at enhancing code correctness and clarity in type-checked environments.",
