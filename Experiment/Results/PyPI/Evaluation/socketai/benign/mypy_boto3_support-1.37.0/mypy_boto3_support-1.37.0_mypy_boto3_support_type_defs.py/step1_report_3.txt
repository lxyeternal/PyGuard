  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for AWS Support service responses and requests, aimed at type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, class and type annotations, imported modules, and type annotations for data structures.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output points include the data attributes within TypedDicts and return values from functions or methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from data sources (e.g., input parameters, external data) into TypedDict instances and attribute assignments; no explicit untrusted input processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version appears standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of TypedDicts and type aliases for the AWS Support SDK, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. All classes are simple data structures with no executable logic, no input validation, or external communication. The code is purely type declaration for documentation and static analysis purposes. No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors, are present. Use of third-party modules (typing_extensions) is standard for supporting newer type hints on older Python versions. Overall, this appears to be a benign, well-structured set of type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely for type annotations and data structure definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical, non-suspicious part of a Python SDK for AWS support services.",
