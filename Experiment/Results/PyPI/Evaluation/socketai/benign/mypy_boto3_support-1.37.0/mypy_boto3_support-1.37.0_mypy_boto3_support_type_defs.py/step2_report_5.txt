  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS Support API, using standard imports and conditional compatibility handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or data flow issues; purely static type definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or obfuscated code, no secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard for static type annotations, well-structured, with no malicious behavior. The confidence is high (1), malware and security risk are zero.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations for boto3 support.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing, no runtime data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies detected; standard use of typing extensions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely type definitions, no malicious intent, no suspicious patterns. High confidence, malware zero.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines data structures for AWS Support SDK, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic, no data processing or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors; standard practice.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward type annotations, benign, no malicious patterns. High confidence, malware zero.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, detailed type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling, purely static data structure definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; version-dependent imports are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just type annotations. High confidence, malware zero.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines data types for support API, with compatibility handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime or external data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** Slightly unusual is the copyright date (2025), which might be a placeholder or typo, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, purely structural. High confidence, malware zero.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that this code is purely static type annotations and data structure definitions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Security Risks:** None identified; no external data handling, no secrets, no runtime logic.\n- **Consistency:** All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n### My Reasoned Estimate:\nGiven the thorough review and consensus, I agree with the provided assessments. The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS Support SDK, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and intended solely for static type checking.",
