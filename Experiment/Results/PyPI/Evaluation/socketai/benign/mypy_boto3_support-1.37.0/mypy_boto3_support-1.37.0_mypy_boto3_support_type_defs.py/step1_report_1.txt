  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for AWS Support service responses and requests, facilitating type safety in Python code interacting with the AWS Support API.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.response, and type definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or insecure data handling points; the code mainly defines data structures.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this code does not process runtime data but defines static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations using TypedDict and Union, conditionally importing modules based on Python version. It carefully defines data structures for AWS Support API interactions. There are no runtime data processing, external data reads, or code execution. The code does not include network operations, dynamic code execution, or credential handling. Its structure and content are typical for type definition modules. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious logic are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations and data definitions intended for static type checking. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and aligns with standard Python type definition practices.",
