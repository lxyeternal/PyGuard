{
  "purpose": "The code defines Python type annotations for support service data structures used in AWS SDKs, specifically for boto3 support service responses and requests.",
  "sources": "Constant strings defining type names, imports of standard typing modules, dynamic import based on Python version, and type definitions including TypedDicts, Unions, and class aliases.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file operations, or eval/exec functions are present; data structures are used for typing and documentation.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and data definitions flow from input parameters (e.g., request types) to output responses (e.g., response types), mainly used for static type checking.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated logic, or malicious code are present. The code strictly defines data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides detailed type definitions for a support-related AWS SDK, using TypedDict for structured data, Union for flexible types, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. The code is well-structured for type hinting and documentation, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior. The presence of version-dependent imports is standard for maintaining compatibility, not malicious. No network, file, or runtime execution functions are involved, and the data structures are straightforward for SDK usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining data types and has no malicious intent or behavior. It is a standard implementation for type annotations in a Python SDK, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
