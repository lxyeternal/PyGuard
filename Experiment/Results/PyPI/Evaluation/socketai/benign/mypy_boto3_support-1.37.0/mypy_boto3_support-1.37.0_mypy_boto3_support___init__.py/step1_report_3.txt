{
  "purpose": "Provide an interface for interacting with the AWS Support service via boto3, including client creation and paginator setup.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; imports modules and defines variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and assigns classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that re-exports classes related to AWS support service. It imports support client and paginator classes, assigns the client class to a variable, and defines __all__ for module exports. No external input handling, data processing, or execution of dynamic code is present. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or obfuscated code. The code's purpose is to serve as an interface wrapper, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign module defining and exporting classes for AWS support interaction. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and aligns with typical SDK wrapper code.",
