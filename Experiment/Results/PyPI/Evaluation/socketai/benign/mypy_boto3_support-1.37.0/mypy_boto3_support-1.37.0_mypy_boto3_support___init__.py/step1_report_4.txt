{
  "purpose": "Provides main interface and documentation for support service using boto3 SDK wrappers.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator) and the hardcoded string in __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leakage or unsafe operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and an alias.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes from internal files, assigns an alias, and defines the __all__ list for exports. It contains no user input, network activity, or external data handling. The copyright notice is static text, and the documentation link is a safe URL. There is no obfuscated or suspicious code, and no execution logic beyond static imports and exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign interface module for supporting services. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a simple wrapper for support client classes, with no signs of supply chain attacks or malware.",
