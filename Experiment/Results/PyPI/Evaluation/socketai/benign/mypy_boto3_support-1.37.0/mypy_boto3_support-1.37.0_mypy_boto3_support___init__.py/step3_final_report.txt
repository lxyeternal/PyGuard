{
  "purpose": "Provides a simple interface and wrapper for AWS support service classes, facilitating usage of boto3 support client and paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator); no external data sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; static code with no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class aliasing; no runtime data flow or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright (2025) and a typo in the documentation URL ('boto3_stubs_docs'), likely placeholders or typos, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static module importing classes and defining an alias and exports. It contains no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The only unusual aspect is the future year and a documentation URL typo, which are benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external effects indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward interface module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor anomalies are likely placeholders or typos and do not impact security. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
