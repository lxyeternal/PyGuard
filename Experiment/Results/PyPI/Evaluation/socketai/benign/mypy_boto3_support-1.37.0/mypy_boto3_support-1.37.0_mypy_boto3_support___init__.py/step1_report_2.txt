{
  "purpose": "Main interface for support service to provide access to AWS support functionalities through boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator), module-level string documentation, and the copyright statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly defines imports, assignments, and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The copyright year (2025) may be future-dated but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports support client classes and paginators, assigns Client as SupportClient, and defines __all__ for exports. The documentation string provides usage instructions and a link. No untrusted input, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The code structure is simple, intended for API exposure without any hidden or suspicious code sections.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears benign, serving as an interface or wrapper for AWS support SDK components. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
