The primary security concern involves the dynamic import mechanism, which could be exploited if inputs are not sanitized. Proper validation can mitigate this risk. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is absent, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.35), reflecting potential misuse rather than malicious intent."
