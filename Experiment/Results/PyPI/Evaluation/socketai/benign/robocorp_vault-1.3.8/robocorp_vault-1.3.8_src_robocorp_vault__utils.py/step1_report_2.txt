  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment variable retrieval, dynamic module import, path resolution, and URL joining.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.getenv, module names/paths via input parameters, file paths via function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import calls, attribute access on imported modules, environment variable retrieval, path resolution, URL string concatenation.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read in 'required_env'. Module names or paths are used in 'import_by_name' which perform import and attribute access. Path resolution occurs in 'resolve_path'. URL parts are joined in 'url_join'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or malicious behaviors. The import logic is flexible but standard; no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors present. No suspicious URL or environment variable leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for common tasks: loading environment variables, importing modules or attributes dynamically, resolving filesystem paths, and joining URL segments. The import_by_name function has multiple fallback mechanisms to import modules or attributes based on the provided name, which could be exploited if untrusted input is supplied, but in typical usage, it is a standard pattern. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or indicators of sabotage are present. The code does not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification beyond module imports and path handling. Overall, the functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions without malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs safe and common operations for environment variable access, module importing, path resolving, and URL joining. No malicious or suspicious activities are detected.",
