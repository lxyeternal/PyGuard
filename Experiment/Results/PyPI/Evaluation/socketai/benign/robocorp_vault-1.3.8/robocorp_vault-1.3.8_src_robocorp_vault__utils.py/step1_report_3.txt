  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment variable retrieval, dynamic module importing, path resolving, and URL joining.",
  "sources": "os.getenv() for environment variables; importlib.import_module() for dynamic module import; Path() for path resolution; string operations for URL joining.",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module() (potential dynamic import), getattr() (attribute access), os.getenv() (environment variable), Path().resolve() (filesystem access).",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read via os.getenv(). Modules are imported dynamically via importlib.import_module() based on input strings. Attributes may be accessed via getattr() after import. Path strings are expanded and resolved. URL parts are concatenated after string stripping.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code present. No evidence of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or network activity. Use of importlib for dynamic import can be misused but is not malicious per se; depends on caller input.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions without any direct network or system modification commands. Dynamic import logic handles various import scenarios but relies on caller inputs, which could be manipulated if user-controlled. No suspicious hardcoded data, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. Path resolution and URL joining are standard operations. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for environment management, dynamic importing, path handling, and URL concatenation. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. Risks primarily depend on how caller inputs are managed, but no malicious intent is inherently present.",
