  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, then synthesize an overall risk estimate.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is standard utility functions with no malicious intent. Dynamic import handling is common but potentially risky if user input is untrusted.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, due to potential misuse of dynamic import with untrusted input)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard utility functions with cautious notes on dynamic import risks.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, no malicious activity. The report’s conclusion aligns with the code’s behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same utility functions, standard operations, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, utility functions with potential risks in dynamic import if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious code, but the potential for misuse exists if inputs are not sanitized.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Highlights that `import_by_name` can be dangerous if supplied with malicious input, as it allows arbitrary module or attribute import without validation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.45 (moderate, due to the potential for exploitation)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is valid. The function's design does pose a risk if used improperly, but no malicious activity is present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all cases, consistent with straightforward utility functions.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation, with Report 5 noting a higher risk (0.45) due to the potential misuse of dynamic import.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n\n- The **malware score** remains at 0 across all reports because the code does not contain any malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as the code is clear and readable.\n- The **security risk** should reflect the potential for misuse:\n  - The code is generally safe but includes dynamic import functions that could be exploited if caller inputs are untrusted.\n  - The highest risk is associated with `import_by_name`, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if misused.\n  - The current scores (around 0.2 to 0.45) seem reasonable.\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is transparent)\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for misuse, especially in `import_by_name`, I would assign a **risk score around 0.3 to 0.4** to reflect moderate risk if inputs are untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate                     | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                                   | No malicious payloads or behaviors present.                                                    |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                                   | Code is straightforward and readable.                                                             |\n| Risk            | **0.35**                            | Moderate risk due to dynamic import functions that could be exploited with malicious inputs. |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is standard utility functions with no inherent malicious intent. The primary security concern is the potential misuse of `import_by_name` if user-controlled inputs are passed without validation. Proper input validation and restrictions should be enforced in production environments to mitigate this risk.",
