  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions are standard; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The functions are typical and safe; dynamic import patterns are common but should be used cautiously with untrusted input. No issues identified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard utility functions with no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates safe usage; no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Slightly more detailed; highlights potential risks with dynamic import if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, but notes the potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Recognizes that `import_by_name` allows arbitrary module/attribute import, which could be dangerous if inputs are malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.45\n- **Assessment:** This is the most cautious report, assigning a higher security risk due to the potential for arbitrary code execution if caller inputs are malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** No evidence of embedded malware, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious payloads.\n- **Potential Risks:** The main concern is the `import_by_name` function, which performs dynamic imports based on input strings. If untrusted input is passed, it could lead to execution of malicious modules or attributes.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - The reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no direct malicious activity.\n  - The risk score varies from 0.2 to 0.45, reflecting awareness that misuse of dynamic import can be dangerous.\n  - The highest risk score (0.45) is justified because if the function is used improperly, it could facilitate code injection or execution of malicious modules.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Score Adjustment:** The risk score of 0.45 in Report 5 is reasonable given the potential misuse. The other reports' risk scores of 0.2 are conservative but acceptable for standard utility code.\n- **Malware Score:** Remains at 0 across all reports; no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Overall Security Assessment:**\n  - The code is standard utility code with no inherent malicious intent.\n  - The main security concern is the potential for misuse if inputs to `import_by_name` are untrusted.\n  - Proper input validation or restrictions should be enforced if used in security-sensitive contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.45** (moderate risk due to dynamic import potential misuse)\n\n**This assessment aligns with the highest concern identified in Report 5, which correctly recognizes the potential for exploitation.**",
