  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment variable retrieval, dynamic module import, path resolution, and URL joining.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.getenv, module names/attributes via importlib.import_module, path strings via Path, URL parts via string inputs.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import via importlib.import_module, attribute access via getattr, path resolution, URL concatenation.",
  "flows": "Input strings (module names, attribute names, paths, URL parts) flow into importlib.import_module or Path functions, potentially leading to dynamic code execution if inputs are untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import functions that can execute arbitrary code if supplied with malicious or untrusted input; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions with exception handling. The import_by_name function allows flexible module or attribute import, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The security risk primarily stems from potential misuse of dynamic import with untrusted inputs, which is acknowledged in the reports. Malware scores are correctly assigned as zero, obfuscation is absent, and risk scores vary based on the potential for misuse. The highest risk score (0.45) is justified when considering untrusted input scenarios. Overall, the code is safe but should be used with input validation to mitigate misuse risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of straightforward utility functions with no inherent malicious activity. The primary security concern involves the dynamic import mechanism, which could be exploited if inputs are not sanitized. Proper validation can mitigate this risk. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is absent, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.35), reflecting potential misuse rather than malicious intent.",
