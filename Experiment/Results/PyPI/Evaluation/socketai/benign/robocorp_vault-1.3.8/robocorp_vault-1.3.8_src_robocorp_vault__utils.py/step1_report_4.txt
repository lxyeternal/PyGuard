  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for environment variable loading, dynamic module importing, path resolution, and URL joining.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.getenv, module import paths via importlib.import_module, string paths for resolve_path and url parts",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe module or attribute import via importlib.import_module and getattr, environment variable retrieval",
  "flows": "Environment variables → required_env, User input for module names or paths → import_by_name, Path strings → resolve_path, URL parts → url_join",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of dynamic imports could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but no malicious code execution is evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions with input handling and dynamic importing capabilities. It does not contain malicious code per se, but dynamic import functions could be exploited if user-supplied data is not sanitized externally. The environment variable loader raises exceptions if variables are missing, which is standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions without malicious intent. Dynamic module loading could pose risks if inputs are untrusted, but as implemented, they do not contain malicious behavior. No malware signatures or security risks are evident within this code segment.",
