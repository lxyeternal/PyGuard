  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment variable retrieval, dynamic import, path resolution, and URL joining.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.getenv, importlib.import_module for dynamic imports, string paths for resolve_path, and URL parts for url_join.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import statements (importlib.import_module), environment variable access, and string manipulations for paths and URLs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and returned directly; importlib.import_module potentially loads external modules based on input; paths are expanded and joined via string manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The import_by_name function handles multiple import scenarios but is standard for dynamic import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for environment variable access, dynamic module import, path resolution, and URL construction. It employs standard Python modules and safe practices with exception handling. The import_by_name function attempts multiple import methods, which can be risky if user-controlled input is passed; however, this is a common pattern in dynamic import mechanisms. No obfuscated code, malicious commands, or suspicious network activity are present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for a Python project with no malicious intent or security risks evident. The dynamic import mechanism should be used carefully with untrusted input, but this is a typical pattern. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malware concerns.",
