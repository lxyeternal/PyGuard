  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code correctness, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for env vars, dynamic import, path resolution, URL join. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low)  \n- **Analysis:** The functions are standard, with exception handling and no hardcoded secrets. Dynamic import is used cautiously, but untrusted input could pose risks.  \n- **Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code. No malware or malicious intent detected. The low risk score is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** **Scores are reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, standard operations, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2  \n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning as Report 1. The functions are safe, with typical patterns.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, standard usage, no malicious code.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2  \n- **Analysis:** Same as above, no malicious activity.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid.  \n- **Conclusion:** **Scores are justified.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with emphasis on potential risks due to dynamic import if inputs are untrusted.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious code present; the concern is about potential misuse if inputs are untrusted. The score reflects low inherent risk.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** **Scores are reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same utility functions, but explicitly notes that `import_by_name` can be dangerous if given malicious input.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.45 (higher than others) due to potential misuse of dynamic import.  \n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that dynamic import can be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but the code itself does not perform malicious actions.  \n- **Justification for higher risk:** The increased score reflects the potential for malicious exploitation if the function is misused, not that it is malicious by itself.  \n- **Verdict:** The score is justified, though perhaps slightly conservative; the code itself is benign, but the potential misuse warrants a moderate risk score.  \n- **Conclusion:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which is accurate given the code. No signs of malicious payloads or backdoors.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk scores:** Generally low (0.2), except for report 5, which appropriately has a higher risk score (0.45) due to the potential for misuse.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The only area to monitor is the `import_by_name` function, which, if used improperly with untrusted input, could lead to security issues. The elevated risk score in report 5 reflects this.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 for reports 1-4; 0.45 for report 5 — matching the potential misuse concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No evidence of malware or obfuscation, but dynamic import functions should be used cautiously with untrusted input, which is well reflected in the risk scores.",
