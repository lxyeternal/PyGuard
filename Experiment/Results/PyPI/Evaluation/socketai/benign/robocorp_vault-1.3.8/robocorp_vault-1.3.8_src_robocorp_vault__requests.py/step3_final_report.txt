{
  "purpose": "A wrapper around the `requests` library providing error handling, retries, logging, and environment-based configuration for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (`RC_DEBUG_API`, `RPA_DEBUG_API`, `RC_DISABLE_SSL`), request parameters, response content.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, logs, exceptions, error responses.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence SSL verification and debugging; request methods invoke network calls; error handling parses responses and raises exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable `RC_DISABLE_SSL` to disable SSL verification; verbose logging of URLs when `_sensitive` is true, stripping query parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTTP client wrapper with retry logic, error parsing, and configurable SSL verification. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. The only security concern is the optional SSL disablement controlled via environment variable, which can be exploited if misused but is common in testing environments. Logging sensitive URLs could leak information if logs are not protected, but the code mitigates this by stripping query parameters. The retry mechanism and error handling are robust and standard. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard HTTP request wrapper with no malicious intent. The only minor security concern is the optional disabling of SSL verification, which should be used cautiously. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the potential misuse of SSL disablement but not indicating malicious behavior.",
