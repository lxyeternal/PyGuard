  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a wrapper around `requests` with retries, error handling, logging, and environment-based configuration.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- Use of environment variables (`RC_DEBUG_API`, `RPA_DEBUG_API`, `RC_DISABLE_SSL`) for configuration.\n- The only notable security concern is the optional disabling of SSL verification (`verify=False`) via environment variable, which can be risky if misused.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:** Well-structured, standard error handling, retries, no malicious behavior, only potential security concern with `RC_DISABLE_SSL`.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code. The only security concern is the optional SSL disablement, which is common but could be misused. The score of 0.2 for security risk is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard retry logic, error parsing, and the optional SSL disablement.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no malicious behavior detected. The analysis is accurate. The SSL disablement is a potential security concern but not malicious. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:** Focuses on the robustness of error handling, retry logic, and the potential security concern with `RC_DISABLE_SSL`. Also notes that verbose logging might expose sensitive URLs if `_sensitive` is true.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is correct. No malware or obfuscation. The security risk score is appropriate, given the optional SSL disablement and logging considerations.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizes the standard design, environment variables, and potential security issues with SSL disablement and logging.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. No malicious code, and the security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:** Similar to others, highlights the same points: environment variables, error handling, retries, and the security concern with SSL disablement.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the other reports. No malicious activity, and the risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.2 across all reports is reasonable, primarily due to the optional disabling of SSL verification, which can be risky if misused.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (due to SSL disablement and verbose logging potential exposure)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, with the only caveat being the optional insecure SSL verification, which is a common but potentially risky feature. No changes to scores are necessary.",
