  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Wrapper around `requests` with retries, error handling, logging.\n- Sources: Environment variables (`RC_DEBUG_API`, `RPA_DEBUG_API`, `RC_DISABLE_SSL`), request parameters.\n- Sinks: Network requests, logs, exceptions.\n- Anomalies: Use of environment variables for configuration, optional SSL disable.\n- Analysis: Standard, robust HTTP client. No signs of malicious activity. SSL disable is a security concern but common.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate code. Malware score: 0.0. Risk score: 0.2 (due to SSL disable possibility).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose and structure.\n- Emphasizes error parsing, retry logic, environment variables.\n- No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Standard, secure implementation. Malware score: 0.0. Risk score: 0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focus on API interaction, error handling, retries.\n- Notes potential data leak via logs if `_sensitive` is true.\n- Environment variable `RC_DISABLE_SSL` again noted.\n- No malicious intent or backdoors.\n- Conclusion: Safe, with caution needed around SSL disable and logging of sensitive URLs. Malware score: 0.0. Risk score: 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar analysis.\n- Highlights the use of environment variables, error parsing, retry logic.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, standard code. Malware score: 0.0. Risk score: 0.2.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same overall purpose.\n- Notes the use of environment variables, error handling, and potential info leaks via logs.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, reliable code. Malware score: 0.0. Risk score: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code described is present and consistent across reports.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious payloads. All reports confirm the code is a standard HTTP wrapper.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** The only potential concern is the optional disabling of SSL verification via environment variable (`RC_DISABLE_SSL`). While this can be misused, it is a common feature for testing and debugging, not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — due to the insecure SSL disable option, which could be exploited if misused, but is not malicious by itself.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided assessments.** The code is a standard, well-structured HTTP request wrapper with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor security concern about disabling SSL verification should be documented but does not elevate the risk to a high level.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and my detailed review.",
