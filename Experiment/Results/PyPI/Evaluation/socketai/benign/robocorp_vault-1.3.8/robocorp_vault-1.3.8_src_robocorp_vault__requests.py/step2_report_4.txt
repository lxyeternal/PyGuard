  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a wrapper around the `requests` library, with error handling, retries, logging, and environment variable-based configuration.\n- No report mentions any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads.\n- The code includes features like disabling SSL verification (`RC_DISABLE_SSL`) and verbose logging, which are common in testing or debugging but can pose security risks if misused.\n- The retry logic, error parsing, and custom exception handling appear standard and robust.\n- There are no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  The reports mainly focus on environment-variable-based configuration, error handling, and logging. These are all accurate reflections of the code. No critical issues or malicious elements are identified.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only potential concern is the use of `verify=False` controlled by an environment variable, which can be insecure if used improperly. However, this is a common practice in non-production environments and not inherently malicious.\n- The logging of URLs with `_sensitive=True` could leak sensitive data if not managed properly, but the code takes steps to strip query parameters.\n\n### Scores justification:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the straightforward, clear code structure.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The risk scores are around 0.2, reflecting minor security concerns mainly due to SSL verification disabling and verbose logging, but nothing severe.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code is well-structured, standard for API clients, and does not exhibit malicious intent.\n- The use of environment variables for configuration is typical.\n- No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are evident.\n- The only real security concern is the optional disabling of SSL verification, which should be used cautiously.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed reviews, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Minor security concern due to SSL disablement and verbose logging, but not critical.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, legitimate, and standard for its purpose.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No suspicious or malicious elements are present.\n- The only potential security issue is environment-variable-based SSL verification disablement, which is common but should be used cautiously.\n\n**My final recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Malware        | 0            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2          |\n\nThis reflects a benign, well-implemented HTTP wrapper with minimal security concerns.",
