{
  "purpose": "A container class for managing secrets with key-value pairs, providing dictionary-like access and properties for secret metadata.",
  "sources": "Input data: 'values' parameter in __init__, which is a dictionary of key-value pairs; other properties access internal variables.",
  "sinks": "Methods that access or modify the internal dictionary (_dict), including __getitem__, __setitem__, and update.",
  "flows": "Initialization takes 'values' dict -> stored in internal _dict -> access/update through __getitem__, __setitem__, or update method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no external network access, no obfuscated code, no data leaks or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates secret data with standard Python dict behaviors. It ensures keys are stored as strings and prevents logging of internal values by default. No external data sources or sinks indicate malicious activity. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or security-sensitive operations beyond basic data storage. Overall, this appears to be a straightforward, benign implementation of a secret container.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign container for secret data, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as an internal data holder with safe practices. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
