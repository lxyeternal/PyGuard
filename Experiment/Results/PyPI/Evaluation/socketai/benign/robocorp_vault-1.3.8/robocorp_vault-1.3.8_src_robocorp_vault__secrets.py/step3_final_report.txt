  "purpose": "A container class for managing secrets with associated metadata, providing dictionary-like access and safe handling of keys.",
  "sources": "Initialization with name, description, and values; property accessors; update method; __getitem__, __setitem__, __contains__ methods.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; internal data access only.",
  "flows": "Input data during initialization and updates flow into internal dictionary; key conversions from various types to str; data accessed via __getitem__ and __contains__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple, well-structured class for secret management, converting all keys to strings, and providing standard dictionary behaviors. It does not perform network I/O, execute external commands, or contain obfuscated code. The class is designed for internal secret storage, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The code's benign nature is supported by the absence of external interactions, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The use of standard Python collections and clear property methods indicates straightforward, maintainable code. Overall, the implementation is safe, with minimal inherent security risk due to secret handling, but no actual malicious or risky behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign secret container class with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate given its purpose. No modifications are necessary; the code poses minimal security concerns.",
