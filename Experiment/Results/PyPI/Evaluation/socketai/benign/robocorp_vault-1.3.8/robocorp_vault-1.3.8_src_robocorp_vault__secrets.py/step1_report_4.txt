{
  "purpose": "Container class for managing secrets with associated metadata and key-value pairs, with no external interactions.",
  "sources": "Input data: 'values' parameter during initialization, optional updates via 'update()' method, key access through __getitem__ and __setitem__.",
  "sinks": "Access to internal dictionary via __getitem__, __setitem__, and update method. No external data sinks or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Initialization data flows from constructor into internal dictionary; key-value updates flow through update method; data retrieval flows through __getitem__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no external I/O or network interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a secure, simple container class for secrets, with methods to store, access, and update key-value pairs. It converts all keys to strings to maintain consistency and provides properties for metadata. No external data transfer, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The class primarily manages data internally without side effects. The implementation appears straightforward and adheres to good practices, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign container class designed for secret management with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs internal data handling safely without external communication or data leaks.",
