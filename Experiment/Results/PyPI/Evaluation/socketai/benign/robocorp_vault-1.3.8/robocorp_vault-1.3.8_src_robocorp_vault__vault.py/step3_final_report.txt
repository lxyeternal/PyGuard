{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class for managing secrets via pluggable adapters, selected through environment variables or constructor arguments, with validation to ensure proper subclassing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (RC_VAULT_SECRET_MANAGER, RPA_SECRET_MANAGER), dynamic import via import_by_name, constructor arguments.",
  "sinks": "Delegated methods (get_secret, set_secret) calling adapter methods; no direct sinks in the code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine adapter class -> import_by_name loads class -> validation confirms subclass -> factory creates adapter instance -> get_secret/set_secret delegate to adapter.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import based on environment variables; reliance on environment variable control; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code manages secret adapters dynamically, validating their class inheritance. It handles environment variable configuration with fallback options, uses try-except for import errors, and delegates secret operations. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main concern is the potential exploitation if environment variables are maliciously set, but validation mitigates this risk. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure secret management wrapper with proper validation and error handling. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The risk is minimal, primarily related to environment variable control, which is common in such patterns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate.",
