{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Vault class that manages secrets using various secret manager adapters, allowing for secret retrieval and storage.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (RC_VAULT_SECRET_MANAGER, RPA_SECRET_MANAGER) and parameters passed to the class constructor, as well as secrets via the adapter's get_secret method.",
  "sinks": "Calls methods on the adapter (get_secret, set_secret) which could potentially process secret data; no direct data leaks are evident within this code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine which adapter to instantiate; adapter methods are called for secret retrieval and storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hard-coded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code properly handles dynamic imports and includes error handling. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code safely handles environment variable inputs, selecting appropriate secret manager adapters. It uses dynamic importing with error handling but does not execute any untrusted code directly. The code only interacts with secret management libraries and environment variables, without any suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No malicious behavior or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, securely handling secrets via configurable adapters. No malicious activity or security risks are identified. It correctly manages environment variables, dynamic imports, and secret operations without evident vulnerabilities.",
