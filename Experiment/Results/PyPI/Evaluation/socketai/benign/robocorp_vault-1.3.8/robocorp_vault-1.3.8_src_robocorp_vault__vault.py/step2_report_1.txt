  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a configurable secret management wrapper, dynamically selecting adapters based on environment variables or parameters.\n- They note that the code uses dynamic import (`import_by_name`) but includes validation to ensure the imported class inherits from `BaseSecretManager`.\n- No reports detect obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The malware scores are all zero, and the security risks are low (0.1 to 0.2), which seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9), reflecting a consistent understanding that the code is legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Flaws:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly handles environment variables, dynamic imports, validation, and secret operations.\n- **Error handling:** Proper try-except blocks are present for dynamic imports.\n- **Potential issues:** The only minor concern is the reliance on environment variables for dynamic class loading, which could be exploited if an attacker controls the environment, but this is a known pattern and is mitigated by class inheritance validation.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's nature, these are reasonable. The only slight concern is environment variable manipulation, but it's minimal.\n- **Overall:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations & Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher (say 0.2) might be justified due to dynamic import via environment variables, but the current scores are acceptable.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (to reflect the minor risk associated with dynamic imports and environment variable control)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured secret management wrapper with proper validation and error handling. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The risk scores are appropriately low, with a slight acknowledgment of potential misconfiguration via environment variables.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the code appears safe and legitimate. I agree with the current scoring, with a slight adjustment to the security risk score to 0.2 for a more cautious stance on dynamic import via environment variables.",
