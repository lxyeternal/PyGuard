  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure secret management wrapper with proper validation and error handling. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The risk is minimal, primarily related to environment variable control, which is common in such patterns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate."
