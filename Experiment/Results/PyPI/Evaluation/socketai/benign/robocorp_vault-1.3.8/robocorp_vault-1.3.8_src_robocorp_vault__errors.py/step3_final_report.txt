  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for Robocorp Vault errors.",
  "sources": "Class declaration; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is a simple exception definition with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class inheriting from RuntimeError with a descriptive docstring. It contains no data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or complex logic. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or malicious behavior justify these scores. No anomalies or security concerns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward exception class with no malicious or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
