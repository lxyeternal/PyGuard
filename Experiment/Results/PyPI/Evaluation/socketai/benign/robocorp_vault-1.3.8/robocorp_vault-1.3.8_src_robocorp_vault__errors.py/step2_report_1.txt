  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition inheriting from RuntimeError with a descriptive docstring.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or complex logic involved.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the reports correctly note the absence of issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n   - They all correctly conclude that the code is a standard exception class with no malicious or security concerns.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and do not contain mistakes.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, malware, or security issues, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The code is a straightforward class definition with no potential for harm.\n   - **Conclusion:** Risk scores should remain at 0 or very close to it.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware = 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriately 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus solely on the code's content.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nGiven the simplicity of the code, the lack of external interactions, and the absence of suspicious patterns, the scores are justified. The code is a standard exception class with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.",
