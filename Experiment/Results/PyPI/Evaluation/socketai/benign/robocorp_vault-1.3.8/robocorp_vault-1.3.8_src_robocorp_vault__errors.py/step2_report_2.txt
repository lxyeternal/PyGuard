  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition with no data handling, external interactions, or complex logic. There are no issues or vulnerabilities in the actual code snippets provided.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no suspicious patterns. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty. These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all scores are 0, no justification is necessary. The code is a standard exception class with no malicious or risky features.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate. There is no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that the code only defines a class and contains no external or internal data flow, no secrets, and no obfuscation.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, straightforward class definition for a custom exception, with no data flow, external dependencies, or suspicious features. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
