  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, as well as consider the scoring and potential risks.\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition, inheriting from RuntimeError, with a descriptive docstring.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or complex logic.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their description. They correctly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a securityRisk of 0, and the code is a straightforward exception class, this is justified.\n   - No reason exists to elevate the risk score, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard custom exception class.\n- No malicious or security risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security concern)\n\n**Final note:**\nThe reports are thorough and accurate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, benign class definition.\n- All scores and conclusions are appropriate.\n- No malicious or obfuscated activity detected.\n- Overall risk is negligible.",
