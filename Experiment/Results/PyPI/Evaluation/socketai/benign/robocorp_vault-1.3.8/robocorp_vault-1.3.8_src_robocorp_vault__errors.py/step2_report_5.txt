  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward class definition of a custom exception inheriting from RuntimeError, with no data processing, external interactions, or complex logic. There are no issues or vulnerabilities present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree that the code is a simple class declaration with no external data handling, no logic, and no suspicious behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The code is essentially harmless.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as network activity, code injection, or secret exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious features, data flows, or external interactions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no suspicious or malicious features. The uniform agreement and the straightforward nature support a low risk and malware score.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely definitional with no security concerns.",
