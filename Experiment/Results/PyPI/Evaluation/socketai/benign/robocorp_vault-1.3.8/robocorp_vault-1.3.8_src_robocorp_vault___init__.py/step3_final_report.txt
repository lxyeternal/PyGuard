{
  "purpose": "A secret management utility providing functions to retrieve, set, and create secrets, with mechanisms to hide secrets in logs and suppress variable output for security.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_vault, _errors, _secrets), dynamic imports within functions (e.g., robocorp.log), and external vault interactions.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions that hide secret values; potential for secret values to be masked in logs.",
  "flows": "Secrets are fetched or set via vault methods; secret values are optionally hidden in logs; context managers suppress variable output during operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports inside functions (unusual but not malicious); no hardcoded credentials or network activity; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward secret management module, employing standard practices such as hiding secrets in logs and suppressing variable output. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Dynamic imports are used for lazy loading but do not introduce security issues. The code handles secrets securely and correctly, with proper error handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure secret management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
