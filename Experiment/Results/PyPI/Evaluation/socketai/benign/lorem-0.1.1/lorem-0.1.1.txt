The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the small security risk score in one report could be adjusted to zero for consistency."

Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, with a minimal consideration for the bug. Overall, the code is safe, and no security concerns are identified."
