{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'lorem' that generates random Latin-like text.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files for long description; reads no untrusted input during setup process.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; setup parameters are static or from files read at install time.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; setup process uses static configuration and files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setuptools' and falls back to 'distutils' if unavailable. Reads documentation files for long description, defines requirements, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input. The code strictly performs package configuration with static data, following standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, nor does it engage in any insecure or obfuscated operations.",
