  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration script for 'lorem', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading static files ('README.rst', 'HISTORY.rst') for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static file reads only.",
  "flows": "Static file reads leading to setup() invocation with fixed metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: conditional import, reading static documentation files, defining package metadata, and calling setup(). No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to standard practices. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. All signals indicate a benign, standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package configuration file with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence.",
