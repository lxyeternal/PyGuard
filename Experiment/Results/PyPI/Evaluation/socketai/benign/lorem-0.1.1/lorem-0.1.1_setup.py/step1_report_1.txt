  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'lorem' that generates random Latin-like text.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files for long description; no other input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports setup functions, reads description files, and calls setup() with package metadata. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. No external dependencies or insecure practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
