{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test module for the 'lorem' package, verifying sentence formatting functions.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'lorem' module; using 'lorem.sentence()' in tests.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Calling 'lorem.sentence()' and checking string properties; no data flows into vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The 'lorem' package is a placeholder text generator and is generally benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'lorem' module and performs basic unit tests on its 'sentence' function. There are no input sources that accept untrusted data; tests merely check output formatting (initial capital letter, ending with a period). The code does not include any network activity, data leakage, or malicious logic. All functions are straightforward, and the package 'lorem' is a common utility for generating placeholder text, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for a benign placeholder text generator. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected. The code appears safe.",
