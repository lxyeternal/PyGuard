  "purpose": "Generate pseudo-random text, sentences, paragraphs, and documents based on a list of words.",
  "sources": "Reads from a list of words imported from a module, and random number generation functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (word list and random seed) used internally for text generation; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for generating dummy text using random selections from a provided word list or default WORDS. Random module is used solely for internal generation of text structure, with no external data input or output, network activity, or system modification. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious functions are present. The logic is straightforward, focused on text creation, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign text generator module with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no indicators of sabotage. It simply creates dummy text for use in other applications.",
