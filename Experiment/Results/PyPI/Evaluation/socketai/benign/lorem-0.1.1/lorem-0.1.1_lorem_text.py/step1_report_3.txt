{
  "purpose": "Generate placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum style) for use in documents or interfaces.",
  "sources": "Reads from the imported WORDS list, which contains predefined words.",
  "sinks": "Uses random.randint and random.choice to generate random numbers and select words.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the WORDS list through random.choice into the generated sentences, paragraphs, and text outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No external data transmission or insecure operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for generating lorem ipsum style text using a list of words. It relies on the random module for randomness, which is standard. There are no external inputs, network operations, or file operations that could be malicious. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The class simply constructs text from a list of words with configurable parameters for sentence, paragraph, and text length. No data leakage, backdoors, or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign lorem ipsum generator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only uses standard library functions and a predefined word list to generate text.",
