{
  "purpose": "This code generates lorem ipsum style text for placeholder content, including sentences, paragraphs, and texts, using random selection of words.",
  "sources": "Reads from the imported 'WORDS' list and parameters provided during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data influences external systems or causes harm; no data leaks or malicious outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and WORDS data flow into sentence, paragraph, and text methods which generate random text outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of random module is standard for this purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes the 'random' module to generate text, which is standard for lorem ipsum generators. It relies on an external WORDS list, which appears to be a benign source of words. There are no code injection points, data leaks, or malicious behaviors present. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious payloads identified. The design is straightforward for generating placeholder text.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical lorem ipsum generator with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply generates placeholder text using standard techniques. No signs of malware or security vulnerabilities detected.",
