{
  "purpose": "Generate pseudo-random placeholder text (sentences, paragraphs, texts) using a list of words and configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads from the local list 'WORDS' and uses 'random.randint' and 'random.choice' for randomness.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output, network activity, or system modifications; purely local text generation.",
  "flows": "Input source: 'WORDS' list and configuration parameters; Output: generated text strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library functions; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, deterministic lorem ipsum generator utilizing standard Python modules. It does not perform any external communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The use of 'random' and local word list is typical for such utilities. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), and no evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard lorem ipsum generator with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
