  "purpose": "Generate random lorem ipsum-style text using configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading WORDS list from an imported module, calling random.randint and random.choice.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output leaks, no external communication or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data (WORDS, random choices) used to generate text; no external data flows or untrusted sources influence behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The use of the random module for text generation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for generating placeholder text, utilizing random module functions for variability. The WORDS list is imported from a local module, which is common for such utilities. No external network, file, or environment variable usage is present. The functions are straightforward and do not include any obfuscated or suspicious logic. There are no indications of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for generating placeholder text with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
