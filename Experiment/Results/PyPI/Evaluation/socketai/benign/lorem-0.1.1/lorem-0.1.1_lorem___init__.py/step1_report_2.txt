{
  "purpose": "Generate random text that resembles Latin, providing sentences, paragraphs, and text blocks.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module '.text' which provides the TextLorem class.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data processing, external network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Functions call methods from _Lorem() instance; data flows are limited to internal method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code. Use of relative import suggests a package structure but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around a class TextLorem, which presumably generates placeholder text. The functions simply delegate to methods of a local object. There are no external network calls, no handling of untrusted input, and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The import of a local module and the usage pattern are typical for a text generation utility. No anomalies, no suspicious code, and no obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign text generator module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves a utility purpose and does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues.",
