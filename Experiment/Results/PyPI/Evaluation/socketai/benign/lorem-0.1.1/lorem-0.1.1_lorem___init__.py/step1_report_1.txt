{
  "purpose": "Generate random Latin-like text such as sentences, paragraphs, and text blocks.",
  "sources": "Imports 'TextLorem' class from a local module '.text'. Uses class methods in functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Calls to _Lorem().sentence, _Lorem().paragraph, and _Lorem().text flow directly from function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, defines functions that delegate to this class's methods for generating text, and sets some metadata variables. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or manipulations of environment variables. The functions serve as wrappers, and the overall structure appears straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign text generator with no malicious intent, external data leaks, or security issues. It is a simple wrapper around a local text generator class. No malicious or security concerns identified.",
