{
  "purpose": "To generate random text that resembles Latin, providing functions for sentences, paragraphs, and blocks of text.",
  "sources": "Imports the TextLorem class from a local module '.text'. Calls methods on an instance of TextLorem to generate text.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only generates text data using imported classes and functions.",
  "flows": "Calls to _Lorem().sentence(), _Lorem().paragraph(), and _Lorem().text() generate output, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple text generator interface, relying on an external module '.text' for actual text generation. It does not process external input or perform network operations. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues are evident. The license and author information are standard, and the functions serve a benign purpose of generating placeholder text.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign text generator module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is straightforward and does not process untrusted data or perform any harmful actions.",
