  "purpose": "This code appears to be a placeholder or empty script with no functional content.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources; code is absent or minimal.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is either non-existent or a placeholder, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The lack of code limits analysis, and all signals point to benign intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence due to the absence of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is non-functional or a placeholder with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. The security assessment confirms negligible risk, and the scoring aligns with the minimal content.",
