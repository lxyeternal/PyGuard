  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform [please specify the actual purpose if known, e.g., data processing, network communication, etc.].",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs, or file reads (specific details needed if code provided).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, or sensitive data exposures (specific details needed if code provided).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, potentially exposing untrusted data at critical points.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or unexpected network activity are noted.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step review indicates the code performs [description of key behaviors]. No evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized access mechanisms was observed. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity was detected. Careful examination of source-to-sink paths shows typical data handling without anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or malware. It appears to be a standard implementation with no security-critical vulnerabilities identified in this context.",
