{
  "purpose": "Shared code defining D-Bus service signals for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports dbus.service; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive operations; primarily defines signals.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the dbus.service module and defines constants for interface names and object paths. It declares a class 'SignalTestsImpl' with methods decorated as D-Bus signals. The signals are defined with specific signatures but do not include any data processing, input handling, or external data sources. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for setting up test signals over D-Bus, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code inclusion. It is purely for testing and does not perform any actions that could be harmful or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of D-Bus signal emission for testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
