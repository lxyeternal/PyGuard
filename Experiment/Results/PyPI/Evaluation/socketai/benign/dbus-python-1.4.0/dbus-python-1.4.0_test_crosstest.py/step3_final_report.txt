{
  "purpose": "Defines D-Bus service signals for testing purposes, including signal emission methods.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'dbus.service' and defines constants for interface names and object paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data processing, or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Signals are emitted via decorated methods; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward D-Bus test scaffolding, defining signals for internal testing. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. All signals are for testing, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The code's structure and purpose are benign, and the signals are used solely for internal testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard D-Bus testing scaffold with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
