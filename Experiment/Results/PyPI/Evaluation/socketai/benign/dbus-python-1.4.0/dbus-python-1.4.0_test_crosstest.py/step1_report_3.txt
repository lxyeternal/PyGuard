{
  "purpose": "Shared code for cross-test setup and D-Bus service object implementation.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'dbus.service' module and defines constants for D-Bus interfaces and object paths.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'dbus.service.signal' decorators which emit signals on the D-Bus; no other sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Class methods define signals that can be emitted; data flows from method calls to D-Bus signals.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data manipulation detected. The code is straightforward setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard D-Bus library, defines constants for D-Bus interfaces and object paths, and implements a class with methods that emit signals. All elements appear typical for D-Bus service implementations. No user input processing, no network operations, and no unusual code behaviors are present. The code is static and seems to serve as a testing scaffold for signal emission. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard D-Bus service implementation for testing signals. It does not contain malware or security risks. No anomalies or malicious intent are evident.",
