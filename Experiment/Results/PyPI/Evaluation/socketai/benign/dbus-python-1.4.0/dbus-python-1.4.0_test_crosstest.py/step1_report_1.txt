{
  "purpose": "The code defines a shared module for cross-testing with D-Bus service objects and signals, primarily for testing D-Bus interfaces.",
  "sources": "Imports the dbus.service module, which is used to define D-Bus services and signals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data processing is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; signals are defined for internal testing purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code appears to be standard D-Bus service setup for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the dbus.service module and defines constants for interface names and object paths used in D-Bus testing. It then defines a class with methods decorated as D-Bus signals, which is typical for D-Bus service implementations. There are no data inputs, user inputs, or external data processing; all code appears to be for internal testing infrastructure. No secrets, credentials, or potentially malicious behaviors are present. The licensing comment is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup for D-Bus testing with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform any harmful actions.",
