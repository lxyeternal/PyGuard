  "purpose": "A unit test suite for D-Bus signal emission and reception, verifying signal handling in a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for build validation, D-Bus object and interface method calls, signal emission via iface.EmitSignal.",
  "sinks": "Signal handlers that process incoming signals, logging outputs, and assertions within test methods.",
  "flows": "Signal emission from iface.EmitSignal triggers signal handlers (_signal_handler), which then update test state and control the main loop.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; environment variables used for build validation are standard, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python unittest suite for D-Bus signals, employing common libraries and patterns. It connects to D-Bus objects, registers signal handlers, emits signals, and waits for responses using GLib's main loop. No suspicious external activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. Environment variables are used for build validation, typical in testing environments. Signal handling and emission are straightforward, with no data leaks or malicious payloads. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with benign testing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign D-Bus signal testing suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk typical of test code.",
