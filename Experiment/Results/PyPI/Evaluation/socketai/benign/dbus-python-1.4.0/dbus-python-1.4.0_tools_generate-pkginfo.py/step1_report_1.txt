  "purpose": "Generate a PKG-INFO file based on pyproject.toml data, updating the version from command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'pyproject.toml' in the parent directory, reads command-line arguments (sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])",
  "sinks": "Writes to a file specified by command-line argument (sys.argv[2])",
  "flows": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' -> updates metadata with version from sys.argv[1] -> writes RFC822 formatted metadata to output file",
  "anomalies": "Uses command-line arguments directly without validation, potential risk if arguments are malicious or incorrect. No validation or sanitization is performed on sys.argv inputs.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a configuration file 'pyproject.toml' to extract metadata. It updates the version field with a value provided via command-line argument, then writes the updated metadata to a specified output file. It uses standard libraries and a third-party 'pyproject_metadata' for processing. The code does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or handle sensitive data insecurely. However, directly trusting command-line input without validation can lead to unintended file writes or data corruption, but not typically malicious behavior. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward task of updating and writing package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is lack of input validation on command-line arguments, which could lead to misuse, but this does not constitute malicious intent. Overall, the script appears safe from a security standpoint.",
