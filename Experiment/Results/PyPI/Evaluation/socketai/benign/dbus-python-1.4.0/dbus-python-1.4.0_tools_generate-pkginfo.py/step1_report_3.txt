  "purpose": "Generate a PKG-INFO file based on pyproject.toml and provided version number.",
  "sources": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' file and command-line arguments (sys.argv[1] and sys.argv[2]).",
  "sinks": "Writes output to a file specified by sys.argv[2]; reads 'pyproject.toml' file.",
  "flows": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' -> processes with pyproject_metadata -> generates RFC822 metadata -> writes to specified output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity; no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads configuration data from a local 'pyproject.toml' file, extracts package metadata, modifies the version based on user input, and writes the resulting metadata to a specified output file. It uses standard libraries and a well-known package ('pyproject_metadata') for metadata handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The usage of command-line arguments for input and output files is typical for such scripts. The overall structure and dependencies are benign. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for generating a PKG-INFO file from local project metadata, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
