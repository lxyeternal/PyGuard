  "purpose": "Generate a PKG-INFO file using a small subset of meson-python, updating the version from command-line input and writing metadata to a specified file.",
  "sources": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' from the parent directory, command-line arguments for version and output filename.",
  "sinks": "Writes RFC822 formatted metadata to the output file specified by command-line argument.",
  "flows": "Read 'pyproject.toml' -> update 'version' with sys.argv[1] -> write metadata to sys.argv[2] file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses command-line arguments directly without validation, potential for misuse but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file I/O operations, parsing 'pyproject.toml' and generating metadata. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The only concern is the lack of input validation on command-line arguments, which could lead to overwriting files or errors, but does not indicate malicious intent. The dependencies used are standard and benign. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for generating package metadata with minimal security risk. The primary issue is the absence of input validation, which could be exploited in misuse scenarios, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, clear, and safe.",
