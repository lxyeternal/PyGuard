  "purpose": "Generate a PKG-INFO file from pyproject.toml metadata, updating version info from command-line argument.",
  "sources": "Reads from pyproject.toml file in the parent directory; reads version number from command-line argument.",
  "sinks": "Writes to a specified output file in binary mode, potentially overwriting existing files.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration data from pyproject.toml; receives version and output filename from command-line arguments; writes metadata to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. The code reads external configuration and writes output based on command-line args without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, handling potential absence of 'tomllib' with fallback. It loads project configuration from 'pyproject.toml', updates the version with user input, and generates RFC822 formatted metadata. It then writes this data to a specified file. The process is straightforward, with no embedded malicious behavior. The use of command-line arguments for input and output files does not inherently pose risks but could be exploited if misused externally. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility for package metadata generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate metadata extraction and file writing with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is safe and intended for package management purposes.",
