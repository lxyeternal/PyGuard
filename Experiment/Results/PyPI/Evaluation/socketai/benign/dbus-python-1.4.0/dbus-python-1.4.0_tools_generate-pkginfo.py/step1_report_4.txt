  "purpose": "The script generates a PKG-INFO file from a pyproject.toml by extracting metadata and writing it in RFC 822 format.",
  "sources": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' file from the project directory; reads command-line arguments for version and output filename.",
  "buffers": "Uses command-line arguments (sys.argv) to get version and output filename; reads from pyproject.toml; writes to specified output file.",
  "flows": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' -> extracts metadata -> updates version from sys.argv[1] -> generates RFC 822 metadata -> writes to output file specified in sys.argv[2].",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.argv inputs directly for version and output filename without validation; no sanitization of inputs; no security checks on file paths; no handling of potential exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads a local 'pyproject.toml' file and processes metadata. It dynamically updates the version based on user input and writes the resulting metadata to a specified output file. It does not execute or evaluate untrusted data beyond file operations. No code injection, network activity, or secret extraction is present. Use of sys.argv introduces potential risk if inputs are malicious (e.g., overwriting critical files), but no such behavior is explicitly implemented. Overall, the script performs safe file reading/writing with minimal security concern, but lacks input validation which could be exploited in a broader context.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward utility for generating package metadata, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. Its security risk is low, primarily due to lack of input validation for command-line arguments, but this does not constitute malicious intent.",
