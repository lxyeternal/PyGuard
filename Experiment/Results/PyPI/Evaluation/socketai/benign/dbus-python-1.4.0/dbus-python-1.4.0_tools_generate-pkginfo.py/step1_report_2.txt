  "purpose": "Generate a PKG-INFO file from pyproject.toml using provided version and output filename",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv[1] and sys.argv[2]), file reading from 'pyproject.toml'",
  "sinks": "Writing to the output file specified by command-line argument",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1] (version) and sys.argv[2] (output filename) are used directly without validation, then data is written to file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected; dependency usage is standard; no obfuscation or malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The script reads 'pyproject.toml', extracts metadata, updates the version with user-provided input, and writes metadata to an output file. It uses standard libraries and well-known third-party modules without suspicious modifications. No input validation or sanitization on command-line arguments raises minor concern but is common in such scripts. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration present. Overall, the code functions as a straightforward metadata generator.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for generating package metadata with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
