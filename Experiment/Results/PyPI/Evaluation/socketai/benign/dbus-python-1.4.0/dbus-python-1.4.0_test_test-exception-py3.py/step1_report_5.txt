  "purpose": "Unit testing for DBus exception handling, including custom exception subclassing and message validation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (unittest, dbus, dbus_test_utils); uses exception instantiation and method calls.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or outputs untrusted data; exception messages are generated internally.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exceptions -> calling get_dbus_message() -> assertion checks; no external data flow or network interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscated code or malicious intent observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test module. It defines a custom DBus exception subclass and runs simple assertions to verify message contents. All operations are within the scope of testing and do not involve untrusted input, network activity, or data leakage. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for DBus exception handling with no malicious or security risks identified.",
