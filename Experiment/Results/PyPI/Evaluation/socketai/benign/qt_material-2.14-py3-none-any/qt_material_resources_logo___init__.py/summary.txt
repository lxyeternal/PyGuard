  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores, except for Report 4, which exhibits signs of potential malicious activity justifying higher risk scores. The scoring across reports is consistent with their descriptions and analysis, indicating a low to moderate overall threat level with specific concern for Report 4."
