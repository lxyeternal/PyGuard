  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, external data sources, and code execution points such as network connections or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, subprocess calls, environment variable access, and data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user input to sinks such as network sockets, files, or system commands, potentially enabling malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), obfuscated variable names, suspicious imports, or unusual control flow structures.",
  "analysis": "The provided reports indicate that most code snippets are either absent or straightforward, with low suspicion and scores reflecting benign behavior. Report 4 describes suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, and obfuscation, justifying higher malware (0.4), obfuscation (0.3), and security risk (0.55) scores. The other reports' scores are consistent with their descriptions, showing minimal or no malicious indicators. The scores align with the described anomalies and confidence levels, with higher suspicion appropriately reflected in Report 4. Overall, the assessments are justified and consistent with the evidence, though further code review of Report 4 is recommended for confirmation.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores, except for Report 4, which exhibits signs of potential malicious activity justifying higher risk scores. The scoring across reports is consistent with their descriptions and analysis, indicating a low to moderate overall threat level with specific concern for Report 4.",
