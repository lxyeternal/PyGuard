  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the implementation of a Python package, possibly providing some functionality to users. The exact functionality is not specified without seeing the actual code.",
  "sources": "Input sources could include environment variables, user inputs, or external files. Since the code is not provided, specific source points cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system writes, subprocess calls, or data leaks via printing or logging. Without the code, exact sinks cannot be pinpointed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through functions or modules that process inputs and produce outputs, but specific paths cannot be determined without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the actual code. Typically, anomalies might include hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network calls.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of provided code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. No indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are observable without examining actual code content.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign or is not available for review.",
