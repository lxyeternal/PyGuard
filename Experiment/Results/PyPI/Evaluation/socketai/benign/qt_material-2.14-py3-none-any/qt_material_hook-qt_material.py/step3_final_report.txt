{
  "purpose": "The code determines the directory of the 'qt_material' package and constructs paths to various resource files and directories such as fonts, themes, UI files, CSS templates, and resources, storing these as tuples in a list for further use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__file__' attribute of the 'qt_material' module to locate its directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only constructs filesystem paths without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) is used to build paths to resource files/directories, stored in the 'datas' list; there are no data flows leading to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code performs straightforward path manipulations without obfuscation, code execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a package, uses its '__file__' attribute to locate its directory, and constructs paths to resource files and directories, storing them in a list. It does not perform any code execution, network activity, or data manipulation. All reports correctly identify this as benign resource path setup with no malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is absent, and security risk is minimal. The code is straightforward and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to gather resource paths within the package. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware and risk, with high confidence.",
