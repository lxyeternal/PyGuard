{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves file paths related to the qt_material package and constructs data tuples with their paths and labels, likely for resource management or packaging.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ attribute of the qt_material module to determine its file path.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code only constructs paths and data tuples without executing or loading external data.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__ attribute) -> Path manipulations -> Data tuple constructions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code only deals with file paths within the package directory.",
  "analysis": "The script uses pathlib to determine the directory of the qt_material module. It then constructs paths to various resource directories and files within that directory, adding them to a list of tuples for further processing. There is no code execution, network activity, or dynamic evaluation. The approach appears to be for resource management or packaging. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies are present. The code is straightforward, focusing on resource path collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply collects resource file paths within the qt_material package without executing or manipulating data in a suspicious manner. No malicious intent, no malicious code, and no security risks detected.",
