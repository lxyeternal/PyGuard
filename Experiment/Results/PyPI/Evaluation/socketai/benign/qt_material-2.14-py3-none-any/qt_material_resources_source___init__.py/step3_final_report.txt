  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Any code input, data reading functions, environment variable access, network or file operations, module imports, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks through data processing, network calls, or environment interactions, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, unusual code structures, unnecessary dynamic execution, or obfuscated code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either minimal, straightforward, incomplete, or absent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the limited or benign nature of the code. Confidence levels reflect the amount of available information, with higher confidence where code is absent or clearly benign. No anomalies or suspicious flows are identified. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and the scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the benign nature of the code snippets, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the malware scores correctly indicate no malicious intent. No adjustments are necessary.",
