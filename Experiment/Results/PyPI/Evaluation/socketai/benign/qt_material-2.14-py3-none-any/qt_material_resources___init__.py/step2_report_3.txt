  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe similar import statements from a local module named 'generate' or '.generate'.\n- The class name 'ResourseGenerator' appears consistently misspelled; likely intended as 'ResourceGenerator'.\n- No evidence of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, network activity, or other malicious behaviors.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscated are consistently zero, aligning with the minimal code.\n- Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of import statements.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippets are simple import statements importing classes and variables from local modules.\n- No actual code execution, data flow, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- The potential typo ('ResourseGenerator') is noted but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Errors or Flaws:\n- The main issue is the consistent misspelling of 'ResourceGenerator' as 'ResourseGenerator'. While this is likely a typo, it could cause runtime errors if the class name is incorrect.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident; scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- Malware scores are all 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), which is appropriate.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The risk scores are justified as very low because the code is only importing local modules without any suspicious behavior.\n- The malware score remains at 0 because there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there is no sign of code obfuscation techniques.\n\n### Potential improvements:\n- Clarify whether the typo 'ResourseGenerator' is intentional or a mistake. If it's a typo, it should be corrected; if intentional, it warrants further review.\n- Since all snippets are similar, a consolidated assessment can be made.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation techniques observed.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to the typo which is unlikely to be malicious but could cause runtime errors.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code snippets are benign import statements with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The only notable aspect is the consistent misspelling of 'ResourceGenerator', which should be verified for correctness but does not constitute a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If additional context or code reveals more complex behavior, these scores might need adjustment. For now, the current evaluation is appropriate.",
