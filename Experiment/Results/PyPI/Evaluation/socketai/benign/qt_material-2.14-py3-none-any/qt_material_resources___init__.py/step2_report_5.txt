  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms a straightforward import from a local module.\n- No suspicious behavior, no data flow, no sinks.\n- Notes a potential typo in 'ResourseGenerator' but no malicious implication.\n- Malware score: 0, security risk: 0.1, confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a benign import statement. The typo is likely a simple mistake, not obfuscation or malicious. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar import from a relative module.\n- Highlights the possible typo in 'ResourseGenerator' but no malicious activity.\n- No data flow or external interaction.\n- Malware score: 0, risk: 0.1, confidence: 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, a benign import with a minor typo. The risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: import from a relative module.\n- Mentions possible typo in 'ResourseGenerator'.\n- No malicious activity or data flow.\n- Malware score: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo signs of malicious behavior. The risk score could be even lower, but 0.1 is acceptable considering the typo.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar import statement.\n- Notes typo in 'ResourseGenerator'.\n- No malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0, risk: 0.1, confidence: 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above: import statement.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nVery straightforward, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports describe simple import statements from local modules.\n- The only potential anomaly is the consistent misspelling of 'ResourceGenerator' as 'ResourseGenerator'.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- Malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are low, justified by the minimal code activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The typo should be corrected for code correctness but does not indicate malicious intent.\n- No changes needed to the malware or risk scores based on the provided information.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the simplicity and consistency across reports.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minor typo, negligible security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippets are benign import statements with no security risks or malware indications. The consistent typo is likely a simple mistake, not obfuscation or malicious intent.",
