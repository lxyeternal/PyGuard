  "flows": "No data flows are present in this snippet; no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Potential typo in 'ResourseGenerator' which might be intended as 'ResourceGenerator', but this alone is not suspicious or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a relative module. No external input or untrusted data is read. No execution, network, or data manipulation is present. The possible typo in the class name may indicate a naming inconsistency but does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. The only notable aspect is a possible typo in the class name, which is likely a coding mistake rather than malicious activity.",
