  "purpose": "Importing specific classes and variables from a local module named 'generate'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module file 'generate.py' to import 'ResourseGenerator' and 'RESOURCES_PATH'.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the module file 'generate.py' to the current module via imports, but no runtime data flow or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is a possible typo: 'ResourseGenerator' may be intended as 'ResourceGenerator', but this is not inherently malicious. No suspicious or unusual code behavior is visible.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement from a local module. It does not include any dynamic or executable code beyond importing. No input, output, or data manipulation occurs here. Without additional context, it appears to be a standard import statement with a potential typo in the class name.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malicious intent are evident from this minimal fragment.",
