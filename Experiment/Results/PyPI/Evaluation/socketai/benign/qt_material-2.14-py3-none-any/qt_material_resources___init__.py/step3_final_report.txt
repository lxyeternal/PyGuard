{
  "purpose": "Import statement from a local module named 'generate' or '.generate', likely to access resources or classes for further use.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import simply makes resources available within the module.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated misspelling of 'ResourceGenerator' as 'ResourseGenerator', which appears to be a typo rather than malicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a local module. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The only notable aspect is the consistent misspelling of 'ResourceGenerator', which does not imply malicious intent but should be corrected for clarity. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The risk score is low (0.1), primarily due to the typo, but overall the code is benign. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features. No obfuscation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with a minor typo. There is no malicious activity or security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further action is necessary beyond correcting the typo for clarity.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
