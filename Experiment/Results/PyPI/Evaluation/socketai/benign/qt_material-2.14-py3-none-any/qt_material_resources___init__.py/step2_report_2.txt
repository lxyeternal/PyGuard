  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement. No dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The only anomaly is a potential typo: 'ResourseGenerator' instead of 'ResourceGenerator'. This is not malicious but should be verified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1 seem appropriate; the typo is minor and unlikely to be malicious.\n- **Justification for scores:** No malicious activity, low security risk, and no obfuscation.\n- **Overall:** Benign, straightforward import with a minor typo.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, a simple relative import.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Same typo concern; nothing malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1 appropriate.\n- **Scores justification:** No malicious intent, minimal security concern.\n- **Overall:** Benign import statement, no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, a straightforward import.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Typo in 'ResourseGenerator' noted, but no malicious implications.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.0 or 0.1 is reasonable.\n- **Scores justification:** No malicious activity; typo is likely a mistake.\n- **Overall:** No security concern.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern—simple import.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Typo noted; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1 acceptable.\n- **Overall:** Benign code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues; import is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.0 or 0.1 is appropriate.\n- **Overall:** No security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n- All reports describe simple import statements from local modules.\n- The only recurring anomaly is a possible typo in 'ResourseGenerator', which is unlikely to be malicious but should be corrected for correctness.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior in any snippet.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, risk = 0.1 or 0) are reasonable given the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, since there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential typo, a very minor risk (0.1) is acceptable, but overall, these are benign import statements with negligible security risk.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1, primarily due to the typo, not malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in identifying the code as benign. No changes needed in the scores; the code is straightforward and not malicious.",
