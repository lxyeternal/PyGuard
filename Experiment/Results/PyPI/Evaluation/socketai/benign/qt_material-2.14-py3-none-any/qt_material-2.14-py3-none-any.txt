      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign theming and stylesheet management utility for Qt-based GUI applications. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain security issues, or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects minor concerns about broad exception handling but does not indicate any threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SVG resource generator for theming purposes, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the low security risk score reflects minimal threat. The code's intent appears benign, and the current scores are justified."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores, except for Report 4, which exhibits signs of potential malicious activity justifying higher risk scores. The scoring across reports is consistent with their descriptions and analysis, indicating a low to moderate overall threat level with specific concern for Report 4."
