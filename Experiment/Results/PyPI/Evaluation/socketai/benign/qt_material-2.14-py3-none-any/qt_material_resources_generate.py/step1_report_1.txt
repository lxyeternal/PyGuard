  "purpose": "This code appears to generate themed SVG icon resources by replacing colors within SVG files from a source directory and saving them into themed directories.",
  "sources": "The code reads input SVG files from a specified source directory (`self.source`).",
  "sinks": "The code writes modified SVG files into different directories based on themes (disabled, primary, active).",
  "flows": "Input SVG files are read, colors are replaced in their content, and the modified content is written to theme-specific folders.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. The color replacement logic is standard and used for theme customization.",
  "analysis": "The code manages file operations: reading SVG files, processing their content by replacing color values, and saving the results into theme-specific directories. It uses standard Python libraries (`os`, `shutil`, `pathlib`) with no evident obfuscation or malicious code. The color replacement logic may generate multiple variants but is benign. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious network activity, or system sabotage. The use of `shutil.rmtree` to delete directories is consistent with resource regeneration, not malicious behavior. No external data sources or network connections are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a resource generator for SVG icons with themed color modifications. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose aligns with resource management and theme customization.",
