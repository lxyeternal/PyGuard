  "purpose": "The code generates themed SVG icon files by replacing specific color values in source SVG files and saving them into designated resource folders based on theme states.",
  "sources": "Reads SVG files from a specified source directory (`self.source`) using `os.listdir` and `open()`.",
  "sinks": "Writes modified SVG files into theme-specific directories, with no external data outputs or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads SVG content from source files -> Replaces color values -> Writes modified content into theme resource directories.",
  "anomalies": "The color replacement function generates multiple color variants, but this appears to be part of intended functionality rather than anomaly. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes theme resource directories, deletes existing directories with `shutil.rmtree`, creates new ones, and then processes each SVG in the source directory. It reads SVG content, performs multiple color replacements to generate theme variants, and saves them accordingly. The color replacement logic generates a list of color variants with line continuation characters, but these are simply used for string replacement and do not pose security risks. No user input, network activity, or credential handling is present. The code is straightforward and intended for SVG theme generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a theme resource generator that replaces colors in SVG icons. It performs standard file I/O and string manipulation without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No malicious or security-threatening code is present.",
