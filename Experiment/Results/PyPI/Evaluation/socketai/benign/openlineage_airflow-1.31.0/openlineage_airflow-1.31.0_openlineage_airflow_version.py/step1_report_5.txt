  "purpose": "Defines the version of the OpenLineage project, likely for version control and package metadata.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only comments, licensing info, and a version string assignment; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments related to licensing and a simple assignment of a version string. There are no input/output operations, no function calls, no environment variable access, nor any dynamic code execution. It appears to be a standard, minimal header fragment typical for Python packages, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a package metadata marker with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
