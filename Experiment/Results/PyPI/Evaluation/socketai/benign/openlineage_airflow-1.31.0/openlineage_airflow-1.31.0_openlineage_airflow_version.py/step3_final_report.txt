  "purpose": "This code serves as a metadata header for the open-source package, indicating version and licensing information.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = '1.31.0') and comments about copyright and license.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as the code is static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static header containing version info and licensing comments. It contains no dynamic code, input/output, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign boilerplate with no malicious or security concerns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and static nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is straightforward and unambiguous.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
