  "purpose": "Declare version information for the OpenLineage project.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no such elements.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment referencing copyright and license, and a version string. No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of comments indicating copyright and license, along with a version string assignment. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable code that could indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a standard header or metadata declaration, common in open-source packages. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detectable from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical in open-source projects for versioning and licensing information.",
