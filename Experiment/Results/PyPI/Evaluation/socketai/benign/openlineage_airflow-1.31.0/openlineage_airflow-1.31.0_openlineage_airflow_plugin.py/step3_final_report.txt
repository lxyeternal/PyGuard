{
  "purpose": "This code registers an OpenLineage plugin for Airflow, conditionally importing modules and setting plugin attributes based on Airflow version and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'OPENLINEAGE_DISABLED' and Airflow version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; environment variable influences plugin registration but does not lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences plugin class definition; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks beyond configuration control.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for plugin registration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version checks and environment variable reads to determine plugin registration details. It uses standard try-except for optional imports. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The environment variable 'OPENLINEAGE_DISABLED' is used to disable the plugin, which is a common configuration pattern. The code is readable, with no obfuscation or malicious logic. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard plugin registration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score is appropriate, and malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety in the supply chain context.",
