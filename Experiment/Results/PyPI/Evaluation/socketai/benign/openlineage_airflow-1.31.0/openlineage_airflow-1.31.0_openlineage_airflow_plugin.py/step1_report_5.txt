{
  "purpose": "This code configures an Airflow plugin for the OpenLineage project, handling different versions and optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'OPENLINEAGE_DISABLED', imported modules, and version information",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; code mainly performs imports, version checks, and conditional class definitions",
  "flows": "Environment variable read influences class behavior; imports are conditionally executed based on version and availability",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior observed; no obfuscated code or malicious functions",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports modules and defines plugin classes based on Airflow version and environment variables. The '_is_disabled' function checks for an environment variable to disable functionality, which is standard. The version comparisons and exception handling are straightforward. No code injects untrusted data into sensitive operations or performs network operations. The code structure is typical for plugin setup and does not contain hidden or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup for an Airflow plugin with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages plugin registration based on environment and version conditions.",
