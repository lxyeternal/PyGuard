{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to provide an Airflow plugin for OpenLineage integration, conditionally importing modules based on Airflow version and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variable OPENLINEAGE_DISABLED; imported modules such as openlineage.airflow and airflow.version; potentially untrusted input via environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the environment variable OPENLINEAGE_DISABLED, which could influence plugin behavior; imported modules; the class attributes that configure plugin registration.",
  "flows": "Environment variable OPENLINEAGE_DISABLED influences plugin behavior; imports and module execution follow standard patterns; no data flows from external sources into the plugin's logic that could lead to malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard conditional imports based on version checks; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports modules and defines an Airflow plugin based on the version of Airflow and an environment variable. It reads the environment variable OPENLINEAGE_DISABLED to decide whether to disable certain features. The import statements are straightforward, and the logic is version-dependent. No external data is processed in a manner that could introduce security issues; all data sources are either environment variables or module imports. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are evident. The code is standard for plugin registration with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin registration script with conditional logic based on environment variables and version checks. There is no indication of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or security risk within this code segment.",
