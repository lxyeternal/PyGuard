{
  "purpose": "This code defines an Airflow plugin for OpenLineage integration, with conditional behavior based on Airflow version and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variable OPENLINEAGE_DISABLED; imported modules and environment settings; potential imported plugin modules.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read -> conditional logic -> class definition based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of standard imports and environment variable checks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a plugin class depending on Airflow version and environment variable settings. It performs a try-except for optional imports to determine behavior. No data is read from untrusted sources beyond environment variables. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are evident. The logic is straightforward, with conditional plugin registration. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin setup for Airflow with environment-based conditional logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
