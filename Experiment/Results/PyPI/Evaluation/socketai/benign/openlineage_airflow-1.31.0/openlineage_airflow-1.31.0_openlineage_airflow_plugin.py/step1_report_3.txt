{
  "purpose": "This code manages the integration of the OpenLineage plugin within Airflow, conditionally importing and configuring components based on environment and version.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'OPENLINEAGE_DISABLED', imported modules, and version information",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external output; mainly configuration and import logic",
  "flows": "Environment variable read influences plugin setup; module imports influence plugin registration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code uses version checks and environment variable to control plugin loading, which is standard practice",
  "analysis": "The script checks the Airflow version and environment variable to determine plugin behavior. It conditionally imports modules, manages plugin registration, and does not include any network activity, file manipulation, or code execution based on untrusted input. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code, no data exfiltration, or harmful operations present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign plugin registration script for OpenLineage in Airflow, with standard version and environment checks. No malicious behavior or supply chain attack signs detected.",
