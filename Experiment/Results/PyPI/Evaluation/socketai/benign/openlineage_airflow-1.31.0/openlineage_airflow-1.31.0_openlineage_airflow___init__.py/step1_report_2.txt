{
  "purpose": "This code sets up version compatibility warnings and imports for the OpenLineage project related to Airflow integrations.",
  "sources": "Imports from openlineage.airflow.version, packaging.version, airflow.version, and airflow.models; reads AIRFLOW_VERSION and __version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "Logging warnings based on AIRFLOW_VERSION; no untrusted data output or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "AIRFLOW_VERSION value influences which warnings are logged; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks beyond informational logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs version checks and logs warnings based on the current Airflow version. It imports necessary modules and defines __all__ for exports. No malicious or suspicious code segments are present. It operates solely within the scope of version validation and user guidance, with no data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on compatibility warnings and imports. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Overall, it appears to be a standard, safe module setup with no security concerns.",
