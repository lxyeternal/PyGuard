{
  "purpose": "This script manages version compatibility warnings for the OpenLineage project within an Airflow environment.",
  "sources": "Reads the AIRFLOW_VERSION variable imported from airflow.version, and the __version__ variable from openlineage.airflow.version.",
  "sinks": "Logs warnings based on version comparisons; no direct data output or external data manipulation.",
  "flows": "AIRFLOW_VERSION -> Version comparisons -> Conditional logging warnings",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code mainly performs version checks and logs warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, compares the installed Airflow version with specific thresholds, and logs warnings accordingly. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or access sensitive data. The logic is straightforward and consistent with version management. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is evident. The code's structure and content are normal for version compatibility checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check script used to warn users about deprecated or unsupported versions of Airflow in relation to OpenLineage. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
