  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code performs version checks on the AIRFLOW_VERSION variable.\n- It logs warnings if the version is unsupported or deprecated.\n- It imports modules from openlineage, airflow, and packaging.\n- It defines __all__ for module exports.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code's logic is straightforward and benign.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- The warnings are purely informational.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The only potential concern is the reliance on version string comparisons, which are correct here but could be problematic if version formats change. However, this is standard practice and not inherently insecure.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports. No obfuscation present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 in all reports. No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports uniformly assign a **securityRisk** of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The **confidence** scores are 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The **malware** and **obfuscated** scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is a simple, well-understood version check and warning mechanism. It does not process untrusted data, does not execute dynamic code, and does not contain any suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The warnings are static and serve informational purposes only.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports' scoring accurately reflects this.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No further action or concern is warranted.",
