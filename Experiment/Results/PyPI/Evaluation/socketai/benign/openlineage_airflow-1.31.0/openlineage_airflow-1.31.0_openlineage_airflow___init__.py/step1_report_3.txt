{
  "purpose": "The code initializes some version compatibility warnings and imports related modules for the OpenLineage project integrated with Airflow.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the imported 'airflow.version' module and accesses the __version__ from openlineage.airflow.version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "N/A - there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily contains version checks and warning logs; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code structures are present. No obfuscation or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, performs version comparisons, and logs warnings based on the Airflow version. It does not execute any dynamic code, network calls, or handle sensitive data. All operations are read-only and for informational purposes. The logic is straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious intent or code obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility warning mechanism for different Airflow versions in the OpenLineage project. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
