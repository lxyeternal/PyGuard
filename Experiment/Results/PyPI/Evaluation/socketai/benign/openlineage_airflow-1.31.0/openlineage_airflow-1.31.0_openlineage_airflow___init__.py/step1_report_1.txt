{
  "purpose": "The code initializes compatibility warnings and imports related to the OpenLineage project and Airflow versions, primarily for version management and user guidance.",
  "sources": "Imports from openlineage.airflow.version, packaging.version, airflow.version, and airflow.models, along with environment information such as AIRFLOW_VERSION.",
  "sinks": "Logging warnings potentially display messages, but do not perform dangerous actions. No data leaks or insecure operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Version checks source data (AIRFLOW_VERSION) and trigger warnings; no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The warnings are standard, informational messages.",
  "analysis": "The script performs version comparisons and logs warnings based on the Airflow version. It imports relevant modules and sets __all__ for exports. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, primarily serving compatibility and user notification purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility and informational script for the OpenLineage project with no malicious intent. It does not introduce security risks.",
