  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily performing version checks and logging warnings.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- The purpose is to inform users about compatibility issues based on the Airflow version.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity Checks:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly imports modules, performs version comparisons, and logs warnings accordingly. The logic is straightforward and consistent.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports find any malicious behavior or code that could be exploited.\n- **Security risks:** No data leaks, insecure operations, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns are detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code relies on version strings and logging, which are safe in this context.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low (e.g., 0.1). Since no security issues are present, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Note:** The only scenario where a higher risk score might be justified is if the code were dynamically executing untrusted input or performing insecure operations, which it does not.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No adjustments needed for scores; they reflect the code's nature well.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a simple, static module that performs version checks and logs warnings. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is entirely benign, serving as a compatibility and user guidance module. The reported scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
