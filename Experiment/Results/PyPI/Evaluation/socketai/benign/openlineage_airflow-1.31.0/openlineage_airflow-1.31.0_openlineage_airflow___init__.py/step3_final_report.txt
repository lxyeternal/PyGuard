  "purpose": "Performs version checks on AIRFLOW_VERSION and logs warnings for unsupported or deprecated versions to inform users about compatibility status.",
  "sources": "AIRFLOW_VERSION variable, imported modules (__version__, airflow.models.DAG)",
  "sinks": "Logging warnings (console output), no untrusted data handling or external calls",
  "flows": "AIRFLOW_VERSION → version comparison → logging warnings",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version comparison and logging, no suspicious patterns or code obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info, compares AIRFLOW_VERSION against specific thresholds, and logs warnings accordingly. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. The logic is simple, static, and serves as a compatibility utility. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The version comparisons are standard and safe. The warnings are purely informational and do not influence program security. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of data leaks, code injection, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version check and warning module with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are accurate and justified.",
