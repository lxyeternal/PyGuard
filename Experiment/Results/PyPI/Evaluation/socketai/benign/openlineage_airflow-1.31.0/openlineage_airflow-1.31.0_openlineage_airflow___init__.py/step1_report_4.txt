{
  "purpose": "This code sets up warnings and imports for the OpenLineage project compatibility with different Airflow versions, and re-exports certain modules.",
  "sources": "Reading AIRFLOW_VERSION environment variable or attribute, importing modules and version info",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or outputted that could lead to data leaks or code execution",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs version checks and logs warnings based on the Airflow version. It imports modules and sets exports. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network communication or file manipulation that could indicate malicious intent. The warnings are static and based on version comparisons. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard compatibility and informational setup for the OpenLineage package. It does not contain malware or security risks and is consistent with normal package configuration practices.",
