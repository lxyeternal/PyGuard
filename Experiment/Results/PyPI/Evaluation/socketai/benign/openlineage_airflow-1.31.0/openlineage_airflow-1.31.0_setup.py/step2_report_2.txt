  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n- No reports identify any suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n- The code reads a README.md file, defines version and dependencies, and calls setup() with package metadata.\n- No untrusted data, dynamic code execution, network activity, or hardcoded credentials are present.\n- Dependencies are version-locked or range-locked, following best practices.\n- Entry points are used for plugin registration, which is typical.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description in all reports: a typical setup.py script.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; it is straightforward and standard.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- No logical or security flaws are evident.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 1 with high confidence.\n- The scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is present, scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated are justified.\n- The security risk score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 — standard setup script with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is standard.\n- No external data or untrusted inputs are processed.\n- The code does not execute any code dynamically or insecurely.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are consistent with this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Given the thorough review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The package appears safe, and no changes to scores are necessary.",
