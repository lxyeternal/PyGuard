{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining dependencies, metadata, and plugin registration for Airflow.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, defines version string, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network operations or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Static data read from README.md and dependency definitions; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup with no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: reading a static README file, defining dependencies with explicit versions, and registering an Airflow plugin via entry points. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. All dependencies are version-constrained, and the script does not process untrusted input or perform any operations that could compromise security. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
