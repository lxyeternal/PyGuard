{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'openlineage-airflow' Python package, including dependencies, package data, and entry points for Airflow plugins.",
  "sources": "File reading from 'README.md' for long description, package requirements, and version information.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection points include dynamic versioning and requirement specification, but these are standard in setup scripts and do not lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the README file into the package metadata, and dependency strings into the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup procedures using setuptools, reads a README file, defines dependencies with specific version constraints, and sets up package metadata and entry points. No code executes untrusted data, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The only operations involve reading a static file and defining package configuration, which are standard practices in Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain any malicious behaviors or malware indicators.",
