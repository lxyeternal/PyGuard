{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package called 'openlineage-airflow', including dependencies and entry points for integration with Airflow.",
  "sources": "File reading 'README.md' for long description, string literals for dependencies, package discovery via 'find_namespace_packages', and environment variables in the shebang line.",
  "sinks": "Installation dependencies and package metadata are not sinks; no untrusted data is directly processed or executed.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; dependencies and package info are static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code solely performs standard package setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a README file, sets versioning, specifies dependencies and extras, and calls setup() with package configuration details. All operations are standard for Python package distribution. No user input, environment variables (beyond shebang), or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded secrets, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
