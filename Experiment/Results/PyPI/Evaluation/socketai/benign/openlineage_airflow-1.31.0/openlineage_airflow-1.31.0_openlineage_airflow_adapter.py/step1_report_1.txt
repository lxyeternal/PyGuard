{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an adapter to translate Airflow DAG and task metadata into OpenLineage events, facilitating lineage tracking and metadata reporting.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (OPENLINEAGE_NAMESPACE, MARQUEZ_URL, MARQUEZ_API_KEY, OPENLINEAGE_AIRFLOW_LOGGING), Airflow DagRun objects, TaskMetadata objects, external libraries (os, logging, openlineage modules).",
  "sinks": "Emit function sends data to OpenLineage or Marquez endpoints via HTTP requests; no direct data leaks are evident, but external network calls are made.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and DagRun objects feed into functions that generate UUIDs and event data, which are then emitted via network calls in the emit method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials are present; environment variables used for API keys and URLs are typical but should be managed securely; no suspicious code constructs or backdoors detected; code appears well-structured and purpose-driven.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with external systems (OpenLineage, Marquez) using environment variables for configuration. UUID generation is based on execution times and identifiers, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. Logging level configuration and exception handling are straightforward. No suspicious network activity beyond expected data reporting is observed. All external calls seem related to lineage data reporting, with no indications of data exfiltration or malicious behavior. The code appears legitimate, focusing on metadata collection and reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate integration component for Airflow and OpenLineage. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. It uses standard practices for configuration and network communication. Overall security risk is low, with no significant vulnerabilities or malicious signals.",
