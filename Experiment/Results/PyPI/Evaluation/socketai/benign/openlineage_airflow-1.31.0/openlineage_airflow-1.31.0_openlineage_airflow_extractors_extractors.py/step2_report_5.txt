  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core security implications, the presence of malicious code, and the consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code dynamically imports extractors via environment variables and string literals, which could be manipulated.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Environment variables influence module import, which could lead to executing malicious code if untrusted input is provided.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The reliance on environment variables like `OPENLINEAGE_EXTRACTOR_*` and the use of `import_from_string` pose a risk of supply chain attack. No direct malicious code is detected statically, but the flexibility to load arbitrary modules is risky.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is reasonable. The risk score of 0.45 reflects moderate concern; malware score of 0 is appropriate as no malicious payloads are evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar dynamic import pattern, with environment variables and class attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks, primarily internal mappings.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code uses `import_from_string` with external input, but no malicious activity is evident. The risk is minimal, relying on environment variables.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment correctly identifies low risk and no malware, with a high confidence level.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—dynamic imports based on environment variables, with potential for malicious input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Environment variables influence import, which could be exploited.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The report notes the risk of unvalidated dynamic imports, which is valid. No malicious code is present, but the attack surface exists.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The risk score of 0.4 seems reasonable given the potential for exploitation but no active malicious payloads.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar plugin-style dynamic loading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Environment variables influence import, but no direct data exfiltration or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code detected; the main concern is environment variable manipulation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low risk score (0.2) aligns with the static analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern of dynamic import via environment variables and class attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External inputs influence module import and class assignment.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The report correctly identifies the potential for supply chain attacks due to unvalidated dynamic imports but finds no evidence of malicious payloads.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The risk score of 0.3 and malware score of 0 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious payloads are evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** They range from 0.2 to 0.45, reflecting the potential risk due to dynamic imports and environment variable manipulation but no active malicious activity.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.3 — moderate, due to reliance on environment variables and dynamic imports, which could be exploited if untrusted input is supplied.\n\n**Final Justification:** The code is a typical plugin loader that uses dynamic imports, which inherently carry some risk if inputs are untrusted. However, no malicious payloads or backdoors are present in the static code. Proper validation and control over environment variables would mitigate the risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious code detected.                                  |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is clear and straightforward.                            |\n| Security Risk    | 0.3               | Moderate risk due to dynamic imports and environment variables. |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code's security posture is acceptable when environment variables are controlled, but caution is advised to prevent supply chain issues.",
