{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically imports extractor modules based on environment variables and string literals, managing a collection of data source extractors for Airflow tasks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('OPENLINEAGE_EXTRACTORS', 'OPENLINEAGE_EXTRACTOR_*') and string literals used in try_import_from_string and import_from_string functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; the code assigns extractors to internal mappings for later use in task processing.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and string inputs influence module and class imports, which are then stored in the extractors dictionary for task execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of unvalidated external input for dynamic imports via environment variables and string literals, creating potential attack vectors if inputs are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dynamic imports based on environment variables and string literals, which can execute arbitrary code if inputs are untrusted. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the potential for supply chain or remote code execution if environment variables are manipulated. The code's structure is typical for plugin architectures, but lacks validation of imported module/class names. Scores of malware (0) and obfuscation (0) are appropriate. The security risk score should be increased from 0.2-0.45 to approximately 0.5 to reflect the potential attack surface due to untrusted dynamic imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader with dynamic import capabilities, presenting a moderate supply chain risk if environment variables are compromised. No malicious activity is detected in static analysis, but the import pattern warrants cautious handling and validation to mitigate potential exploitation.",
