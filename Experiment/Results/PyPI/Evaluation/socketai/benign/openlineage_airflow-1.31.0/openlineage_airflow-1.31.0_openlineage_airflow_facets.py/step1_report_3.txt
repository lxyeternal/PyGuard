{
  "purpose": "Define various data classes and facets related to Airflow and OpenLineage integration, for tracking metadata and operator information.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard Python libraries (typing), third-party libraries (attr, openlineage), and local modules (airflow.version, openlineage.client, openlineage.airflow.utils).",
  "sinks": "None directly, as there are no network, file, or system command executions. Data is stored in class attributes, mostly for metadata purposes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs (like task instances, dagruns) into class attributes via class methods, without external output or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code primarily defines data structures and helper methods. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes data classes for metadata facets related to Airflow tasks, runs, and operator details. Uses standard patterns for class methods to instantiate classes from runtime objects. No external network, file, or system calls. No user input processing, nor data leakage mechanisms. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation. It appears to be standard, well-structured code for metadata management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data classes for Airflow and OpenLineage metadata tracking. No malicious or suspicious code features detected. It appears safe and intended for use within a larger observability or lineage tracking system.",
