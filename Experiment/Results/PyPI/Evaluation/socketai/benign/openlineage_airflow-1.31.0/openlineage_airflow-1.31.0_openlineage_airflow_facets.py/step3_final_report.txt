{
  "purpose": "Defines data classes for capturing metadata about Airflow DAG runs, tasks, operators, and their facets within the OpenLineage framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from openlineage.airflow.version, openlineage.client.facet_v2, openlineage.client.utils, airflow.version, and runtime objects such as dagrun, task, task_instance.",
  "sinks": "Class methods that instantiate objects from runtime Airflow objects (e.g., from_dagrun_and_task, from_task_instance). No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from runtime objects into class constructors via class methods, with no external or network data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of dynamic imports is standard for such metadata classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data classes inheriting from BaseFacet or RedactMixin, used for structured metadata in Airflow/OpenLineage. No network calls, file I/O, or untrusted data processing are present. Imports are from legitimate modules. Class methods instantiate objects from runtime Airflow objects, following standard patterns. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. Redaction mechanisms are straightforward, with no suspicious patterns. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves purely as metadata containers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of metadata classes for Airflow and OpenLineage, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
