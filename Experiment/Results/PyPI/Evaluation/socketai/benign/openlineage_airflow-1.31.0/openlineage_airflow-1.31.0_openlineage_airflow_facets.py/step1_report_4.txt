{
  "purpose": "Define data classes for capturing metadata and facets related to Airflow DAG runs, tasks, and operators in the OpenLineage context.",
  "sources": "Code reads module imports, class attributes, and method parameters such as task and dagrun objects.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; data flows are internal and do not involve untrusted input or network operations.",
  "flows": "Method calls on input objects (task, dagrun) to extract operator class names and task info, then store in class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Use of imported modules appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data classes using 'attr' for storing metadata about Airflow DAGs and tasks, including version info and operator details. It imports version info, utility functions, and constructs data structures with no evidence of malicious behavior. RedactMixin is used for redacting sensitive info, but the implementation details are not shown; no redaction code is suspicious here. There are no network operations, file I/O, or other typical malicious behaviors. The code appears to serve purely as data modeling for Airflow and OpenLineage integration, with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of data classes for metadata collection related to Airflow DAGs, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is well-structured and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
