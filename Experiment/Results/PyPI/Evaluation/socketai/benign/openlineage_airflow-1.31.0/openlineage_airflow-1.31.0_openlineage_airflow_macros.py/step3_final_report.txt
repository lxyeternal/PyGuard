{
  "purpose": "Provides macro functions to extract OpenLineage metadata from Airflow TaskInstance objects, such as job namespace, name, run ID, and parent ID, for lineage tracking.",
  "sources": "Reads from TaskInstance attributes (dag_id, task_id, try_number, execution_date) and internal functions (get_job_name, OpenLineageAdapter.build_task_instance_run_id).",
  "sinks": "No external data outputs or untrusted data sinks; primarily constructs strings for metadata purposes.",
  "flows": "Source data from TaskInstance attributes flow into string formatting functions and internal utility calls to generate lineage identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses internal functions, and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple utility functions that generate lineage metadata strings based on TaskInstance attributes and internal helper functions. It does not perform network operations, handle untrusted input, or contain obfuscation. The functions are well-structured, purpose-specific, and rely on trusted internal attributes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code, although some high security risk scores (0.9, 0.95) are slightly conservative given the simplicity and safety of the code. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for extracting lineage metadata in Airflow. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high security risk scores in some reports are overly cautious; a score of 0 or 0.1 would be more appropriate. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as 0. Overall, the code is safe for production use.",
