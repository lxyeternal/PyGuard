{
  "purpose": "Provides OpenLineage integration functions for Airflow tasks to generate lineage metadata such as job namespace, job name, run ID, and parent ID.",
  "sources": "Data is obtained from the TaskInstance object and imported modules; no external or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code mainly returns formatted strings and identifiers.",
  "flows": "The functions generate identifiers based on TaskInstance data and internal adapter methods, with no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The functions are straightforward, relying on internal utilities and TaskInstance attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for generating lineage metadata in an Airflow context, utilizing imported modules and TaskInstance attributes. All data used are internal and derived from the TaskInstance object or internal modules. No external inputs are processed directly, and no code injections or malicious logic are present. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose in lineage tracking without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for lineage metadata generation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies solely on internal and trusted modules and data, making it safe for use.",
