  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for extracting lineage metadata in Airflow. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high security risk scores in some reports are overly cautious; a score of 0 or 0.1 would be more appropriate. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as 0. Overall, the code is safe for production use."
