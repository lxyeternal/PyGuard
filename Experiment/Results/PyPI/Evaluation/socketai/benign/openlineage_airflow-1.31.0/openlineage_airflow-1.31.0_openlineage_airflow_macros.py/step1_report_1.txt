  "purpose": "Provides macros for extracting OpenLineage metadata (namespace, job name, run id, parent id) from Airflow task instances for lineage tracking.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'task_instance' object, which contains task metadata such as 'dag_id', 'task_id', 'try_number', 'execution_date'. Uses imported functions and constants, but no external data inputs or untrusted sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Returns string values composed of static constants and properties of the task_instance object; no untrusted data is written or transmitted over networks.",
  "flows": "Input: 'task_instance' object → Functions extract properties → String concatenation for parent ID; no external data flows or command executions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code primarily performs data formatting based on object properties.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several straightforward macro functions that generate lineage metadata strings from the provided 'task_instance'. All functions use safe, static methods and well-known attributes; no external inputs are read that could be malicious. The functions do not perform network operations, system modifications, or execute untrusted code. The overall structure is simple and primarily for metadata extraction, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module designed for extracting lineage information from Airflow task instances. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and the logic is simple and safe. No security risks or malware signals are present.",
