  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides macro functions for extracting OpenLineage metadata from Airflow TaskInstance objects.\n- Uses internal functions (`get_job_name`, `OpenLineageAdapter.build_task_instance_run_id`) and standard TaskInstance attributes.\n- No external data inputs, no network calls, no code obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Functions are straightforward, mainly string formatting and data retrieval.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata extraction macros.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Reads from `task_instance`, no external data, no untrusted outputs.\n- **Flow:** Simple data retrieval and formatting.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Clear, safe, straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9 (this seems high given the benign nature). The high risk score might be overestimating, but since the report is confident, it can be considered slightly conservative.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard attributes and internal functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.95. Again, the high risk score seems overly cautious, but consistent with the report's confidence.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same purpose, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. This is more aligned with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar findings; relies on standard attributes and internal functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. Fully consistent with benign behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above, straightforward utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code does not perform network operations, code injection, or any suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign a very low or zero risk, which is justified given the benign nature. The only exception is Reports 1 and 2, which assign a high risk (0.9 and 0.95). Given the code's simplicity and safety, these should be lowered to 0 or very close to it.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Should be uniformly low, around 0.0 to 0.1, reflecting the benign and safe utility nature.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\nThe code is a safe, well-structured utility module for lineage metadata extraction. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The high risk scores in some reports seem unwarranted based on the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.0   |\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The high risk scores in some reports should be adjusted downward to reflect the benign nature.",
