{
  "purpose": "Provides macros for Airflow tasks to generate OpenLineage metadata such as namespace, job name, run ID, and parent ID.",
  "sources": "Reads input from TaskInstance objects and imports from openlineage.airflow.adapter and utils.",
  "sinks": "Returns formatted strings based on TaskInstance data; no direct sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input from TaskInstance -> function calls -> formatted string outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external calls, no obfuscated code. Usage of internal APIs appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several macro functions to generate lineage metadata from Airflow TaskInstance objects. It imports necessary modules, uses standard string joining and function calls, and relies on external adapters/utilities for IDs. No evidence of malicious data handling, code injection, or malicious side effects. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected. The functions seem designed solely for metadata generation and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, focused on lineage metadata generation for Airflow tasks. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the provided code. It operates within expected patterns for such integrations.",
