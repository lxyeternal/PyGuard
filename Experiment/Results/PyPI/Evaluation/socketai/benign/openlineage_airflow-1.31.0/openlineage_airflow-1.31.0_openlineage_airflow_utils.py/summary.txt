  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility library for Airflow and OpenLineage, with no malicious intent or supply chain issues. The subprocess calls are typical for version control info retrieval and are controlled with timeouts. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and risk 0.2 are appropriate. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and can be considered safe in controlled environments."
