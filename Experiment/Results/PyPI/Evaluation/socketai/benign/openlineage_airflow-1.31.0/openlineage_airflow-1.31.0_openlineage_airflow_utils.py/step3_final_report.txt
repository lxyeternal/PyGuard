  "purpose": "Utility functions for metadata extraction, URL handling, secret redaction, and integration with Airflow and OpenLineage.",
  "sources": "Git subprocess calls, environment variables, URL parsing, secret masking modules, and dynamic imports.",
  "sinks": "Potential command injection via subprocess if inputs are manipulated, data leakage through URL or secret handling.",
  "flows": "Source: input parameters, environment variables, file paths; Sink: subprocess execution, URL generation, secret redaction functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with a short timeout; no hardcoded secrets; standard redaction logic; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs subprocess to call 'git' commands with a 0.5s timeout, which could be risky if inputs are malicious but is controlled in typical environments. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. Redaction functions rely on external modules and include recursion limits, reducing risk. URL handling functions are straightforward. The overall structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 reflects cautious subprocess usage, which is common in such utility modules. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility library for Airflow and OpenLineage, with no malicious intent or supply chain issues. The subprocess calls are typical for version control info retrieval and are controlled with timeouts. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and risk 0.2 are appropriate. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and can be considered safe in controlled environments.",
