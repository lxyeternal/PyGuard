{
  "purpose": "This code provides a simple interface for the AWS WAFv2 service by importing and exposing the WAFV2Client class.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .client import WAFV2Client",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling or network activity",
  "flows": "Import of WAFV2Client, assignment to Client, exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future but likely a placeholder or oversight",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns. It imports a class, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it, with documentation provided. No external input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The future copyright date is not malicious but slightly unusual. All signals indicate benign, standard code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor anomaly of the future date does not impact security. The scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
