  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the scoring, and the reasoning provided.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard SDK interface module.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- The only unusual point is the copyright date in 2025, which is in the future, but this is not malicious—likely an oversight or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; describes the code as a simple wrapper with documentation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified; no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no risks.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; similar to Report 1.\n- **Scores:** Same reasoning; no issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; same as above.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; notes the future copyright date as unusual but not malicious.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — slightly higher than others, possibly due to noting the future date.\n- **Justification:** The code itself is benign; the slight increase in security risk score is acceptable given the unusual copyright date, but it does not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; same as others.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All zero or near-zero, justified given the benign nature.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 — fully benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The only minor point is the slightly elevated security risk score in report 4 due to the future copyright date, which is justified but not indicative of any real security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the assessments are correct and well justified.",
