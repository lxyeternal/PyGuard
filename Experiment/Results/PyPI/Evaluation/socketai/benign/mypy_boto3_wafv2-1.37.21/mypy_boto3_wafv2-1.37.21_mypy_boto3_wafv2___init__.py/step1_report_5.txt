{
  "purpose": "Main interface module for the wafv2 service, providing access to the WAFV2Client class for AWS WAFv2.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing WAFV2Client from a local module; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily setting up references and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The copyright date is in the future, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module defining a client interface for WAFv2. It imports a class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and defines exportable symbols. The embedded documentation provides usage instructions. There are no data inputs, no external calls, no dynamic execution, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The future-dated copyright is odd but not malicious. No malicious or security-compromising elements are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a simple, benign interface wrapper for AWS WAFv2 client access. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks in the provided code.",
