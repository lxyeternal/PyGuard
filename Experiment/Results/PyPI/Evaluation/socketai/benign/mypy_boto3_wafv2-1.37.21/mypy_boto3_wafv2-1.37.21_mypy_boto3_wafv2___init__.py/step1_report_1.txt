{
  "purpose": "Provide a main interface module for the AWS WAFv2 service, enabling users to instantiate a client for interacting with the service.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing WAFV2Client from a local module; usage example in comments",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, no network connections, no sensitive data processing",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks; code mainly defines a class alias and documentation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard import, aliasing, and documentation practices",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a simple interface wrapper around a local client class, with documentation and usage example. There are no input handling, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data processing. The import and aliasing are straightforward. The comments include a link to documentation and a usage example, which are typical in SDK interface modules. No indications of obfuscated or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module serving as an interface for the WAFv2 client in a Python SDK. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors, no security risks, and no obfuscation. The code appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
