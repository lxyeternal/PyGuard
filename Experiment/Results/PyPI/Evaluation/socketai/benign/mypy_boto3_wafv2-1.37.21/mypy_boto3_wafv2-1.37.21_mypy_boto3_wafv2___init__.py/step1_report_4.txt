{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for the AWS WAFv2 service, including documentation and client setup.",
  "sources": "Imports WAFV2Client from a local module; no external input reading or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points; no untrusted data handling, network communication, or sensitive information processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines and exports a class reference.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date in 2025, which is in the future, is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a client class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and defines exports. It includes a documentation string with usage instructions and a link. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The future-dated copyright may be an oversight or placeholder but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward interface module for AWS WAFv2 with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It appears benign and serves as a simple wrapper or facade.",
