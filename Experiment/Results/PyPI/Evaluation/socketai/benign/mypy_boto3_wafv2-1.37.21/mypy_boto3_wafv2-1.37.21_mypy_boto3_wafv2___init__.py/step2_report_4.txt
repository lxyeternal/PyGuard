  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal Python module that imports a class `WAFV2Client` from a local module, assigns it to `Client`, and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- It includes documentation and usage examples.\n- No dynamic code, no external data input, no network calls, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The copyright date is set to 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a placeholder or oversight, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of malicious or suspicious code:** None. The code is straightforward, standard SDK interface code.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:** All reports agree on zero malware, zero obfuscation, and no security issues.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None. The code does not process untrusted data, does not perform network operations, nor handle secrets.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright date being in the future (2025). While odd, it does not impact security or functionality. It might be a placeholder or typo, but not a security concern.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1. Given the absence of any security issues, 0 is justified. The 0.1 in report 4 is marginal and likely due to the future date, but even that isn't a security risk.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable; no changes needed.\n- The future copyright date should be noted as possibly an oversight but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious or security issues. The only minor oddity is the future-dated copyright, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The code is safe, clear, and legitimate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.",
