  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and if the scores reflect the actual security posture.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward SDK interface module.\n- No external data handling, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright date (2025), which is likely a placeholder or oversight, not malicious.\n- Malware scores are all zero, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of Issues\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple interface wrapper with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \nNo. The reasoning is sound. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign, with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Evaluation\n\n**Malware scores:**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Obfuscated scores:**  \nAll assign 0, which is correct.\n\n**Security risk scores:**  \nMostly 0 or very close to 0 (0.1 in one report). This is reasonable, considering the code does not process untrusted data or perform any risky operations.\n\n**Are any scores unreasonable?**  \nNo. The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher scores  \nSince no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected, raising scores would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations\n\n- The future copyright date (2025) is unusual but not malicious.  \n- No claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions are present; all assessments are based on code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The scores are justified and consistent with the code.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
