  "purpose": "A minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout using sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' in sys.argv, then calls print_version or print_info, which write static strings to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no dynamic or external data processing",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print static package info and version, and checks for '--version' in sys.argv. It outputs static strings directly to stdout without external data or network activity. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code are present. The logic is simple and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent. No further action or concern is necessary.",
