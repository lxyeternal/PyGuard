  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - No dynamic data processing, external data sources, network activity, or file operations.\n   - No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code.\n   - The logic is straightforward: check for \"--version\" argument, then print version or info.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, with confidence scores of 1.\n   - No flaws or logical errors are identified in the reasoning.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as static, simple, and safe.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0, and security risk = 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No need to adjust scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest scores are 0, indicating no security concern.\n   - No reason to justify higher scores; the code is safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - No suspicious behavior, no code injection, no network activity.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's behavior.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious logic.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - All reports correctly reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' thorough analysis, I concur with the scores. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is necessary.",
