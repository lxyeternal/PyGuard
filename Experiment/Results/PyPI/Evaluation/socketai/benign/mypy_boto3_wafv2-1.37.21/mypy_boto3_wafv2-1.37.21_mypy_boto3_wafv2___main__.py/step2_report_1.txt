  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review & Issues Present**:\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on a command-line argument.\n   - There are no dynamic data processing, external data sources, network activity, or file operations.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n   - The logic is straightforward, with simple condition checking (`\"--version\" in sys.argv`) and static output.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis: they correctly identify the benign nature of the script.\n   - They uniformly conclude no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; the code is purely informational with no malicious intent.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign `0`. Correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign `0`. Justified, given the benign static nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores**:\n   - The scores seem reasonable and consistent across all reports.\n   - No report suggests any reason to assign higher scores, and none do.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic operations, external calls, or data manipulation.\n   - The purpose is purely informational, which is inherently low risk.\n   - The reports correctly interpret this.\n\n6. **My Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious features.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate.\n   - The confidence in the benign nature is high (1.0), matching the reports.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- The overall risk assessment should be **very low**, with no concerns.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign.\n- All reports are accurate.\n- The scores are justified and consistent.\n- No further action required.\n\n**Note**: Always remain vigilant for future modifications, but based on the current static code, the risk remains negligible.",
