  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about boto3 WAFV2 package details and version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check -> print_version or print_info -> stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code only outputs static information and handles a command-line argument.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print static package info and version, and processes command-line arguments to determine which information to output. There are no dynamic data processing, no external data sources, and no network activity or file operations. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious logic. It simply provides static informational output based on CLI input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a CLI utility to display package info and version. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
