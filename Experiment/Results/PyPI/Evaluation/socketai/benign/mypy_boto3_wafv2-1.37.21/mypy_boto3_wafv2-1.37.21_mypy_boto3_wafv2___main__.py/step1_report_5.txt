  "purpose": "CLI script for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, reads from sys.stdout for output.",
  "fires": "Potentially untrusted input from command-line arguments; output is controlled.",
  "flows": "Command-line args (source) checked to determine whether to print version or info (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, providing information based on CLI arguments. It does not process or execute untrusted data beyond checking for a specific argument ('--version') and outputs static information. No network, file, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be standard CLI boilerplate with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple CLI utility to display package information. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
