  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as a simple version string assignment with a copyright notice.\n- None mention dynamic code execution, external input, or data processing.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future year (2025) in the copyright.\n\n**Confirmation of code presence:**\n- The original code is a straightforward assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.21\"` with a comment.\n- No suspicious or malicious code is present.\n- The code does not perform any operations, network activity, or data handling.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- They correctly note the unusual future year but dismiss it as non-malicious.\n- No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Confidence is 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate given the benign code.\n- The only \"anomaly\" is the future year, which does not constitute a security risk.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- The code is static, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious logic.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is standard for version declaration.\n- The future year is not an indicator of malicious intent but could be a placeholder or typo.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with a slightly unusual future year in the copyright notice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo changes to scores or conclusions are necessary. The code remains benign and poses no security concern.",
