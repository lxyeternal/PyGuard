  "purpose": "Define the version of the software package with a static string assignment.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment without dynamic input or output.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future copyright year (2025), which is in the future relative to current date.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string (__version__ = \"1.37.21\") with a copyright notice. No dynamic code, input/output, or data processing is present. The only anomaly is the future year 2025, which is likely a placeholder or typo but does not pose security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with an unusual future year in the copyright notice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
