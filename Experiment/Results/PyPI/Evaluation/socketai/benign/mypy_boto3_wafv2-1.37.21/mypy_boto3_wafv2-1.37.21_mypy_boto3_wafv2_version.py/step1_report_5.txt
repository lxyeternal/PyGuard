  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright date is set to 2025, which is in the future and unusual, but not malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a static string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No obfuscated code, no secrets, and no malicious logic. The presence of a future copyright date is unusual but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier with no malicious intent or security risks.",
