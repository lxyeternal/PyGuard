  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"1.37.21\"`) with a copyright notice. There are no dynamic operations, no input/output, no data processing, and no network activity. The code's purpose is purely metadata.\n\n2. **Anomalies & Suspicious Elements**  \nThe only noted anomaly is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (2023). This is unusual but not inherently malicious or suspicious. It could be a placeholder, a future plan, or an oversight.\n\n3. **Malicious Behavior & Security Risks**  \nAll reports agree that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is minimal and static, with no external data handling or execution.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity or indicators)  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors)\n\nGiven the above, the scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n**Critical Evaluation & Additional Considerations:**  \n- The only point of note is the future copyright year. While unusual, it doesn't introduce any security risk or malicious intent.  \n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are justified here, as the code is static and metadata-only.\n\n**Final Assessment & Recommendations:**  \n- The current scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- No changes needed.  \n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns.",
