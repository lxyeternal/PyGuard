  "purpose": "Defines the version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading operations).",
  "sinks": "None (no output or data leakage points).",
  "flows": "No data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with a future year (2025) that is inconsistent or potentially suspicious, but this is not malicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a copyright notice and a version string assignment. There are no dynamic or suspicious operations, no external input, and no sensitive data handling. The copyright year being set to 2025 is unusual but not malicious; it could indicate a future plan or an error. Overall, the code is straightforward and serves as metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version declaration with a copyright notice. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
