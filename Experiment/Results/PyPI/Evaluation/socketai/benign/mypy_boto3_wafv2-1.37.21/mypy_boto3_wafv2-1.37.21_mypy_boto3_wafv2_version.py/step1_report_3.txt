  "anomalies": "Absence of unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to a module-level variable. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The comment indicates it's the source of truth for versioning, which is standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
