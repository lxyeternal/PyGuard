  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same simple code snippet: a version string assignment with a copyright notice.\n- No dynamic code, external inputs, or data flows are involved.\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year being set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (2024). This is unusual but not malicious.\n- All reports conclude the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of Issues\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious or suspicious logic. The only unusual aspect is the future year, which is not an issue per se.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. The code does not perform any operations beyond assigning a string to a variable.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify that the code is benign and standard for version declarations.\n- The mention of the future copyright year as an anomaly is valid but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### Scores and Their Reasonableness\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware (0):** Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security Risk (0):** Correct; no security implications.\n- **Confidence (1):** Appropriate; all reports agree on benign nature.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- The only notable anomaly is the future year, which could suggest a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't impact security.\n- No need to adjust scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard version string declaration with no suspicious or malicious activity. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security risks or malware potential. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
