  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a static Python module defining numerous string literal types for AWS WAFv2 configurations and related AWS service identifiers.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` from `typing` or `typing_extensions` based on Python version.\n- It contains no dynamic code, no input/output, no external data handling, no network activity.\n- All data are static, human-readable string literals assigned to type aliases.\n- The purpose is to facilitate static type checking, code clarity, and correctness.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The code is purely static type alias definitions with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears correct, well-structured, and typical for type definitions.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware risk:**  \n  The code contains no dynamic execution, external input, or network activity. It only defines static types and constants.  \n  **Thus, malware score should be 0.**  \n  The current reports agree on this.\n\n- **Obfuscated code:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.  \n  **Obfuscated score should be 0.**\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, data leakage, or security vulnerability, the overall risk score should be **0**.\n\n- **Any assumptions or questionable claims?**  \n  All reports correctly identify the code as static type definitions with no malicious intent. No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or exploits.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and overall risk as 0 or very low, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, static type definition module for AWS WAFv2 string literals. It does not pose any security risk or malware threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Aspect | My estimate | Justification |\n|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| Malware | 0 | No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious behavior. |\n| Obfuscated | 0 | Clear, straightforward static definitions. |\n| Risk | 0 | No vulnerabilities, no data leaks, no malicious activity. |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is safe and serves a purely developmental purpose. No changes to scores are necessary.",
