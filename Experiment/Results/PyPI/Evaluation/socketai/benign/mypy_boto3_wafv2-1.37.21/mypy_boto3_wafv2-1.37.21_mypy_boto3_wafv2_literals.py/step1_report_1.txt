  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS WAFv2 service to facilitate type checking and code assistance.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from static string definitions assigned to variables representing various AWS WAFv2 literal types.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in the code that handle untrusted or external data; all data are hardcoded string literals.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists between untrusted sources and sensitive sinks, as the code only establishes type aliases and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected. The code is purely static type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version, then defines a large set of string literal types used for AWS WAFv2 configurations. It includes extensive lists of country codes, service names, resource types, etc. All data are static, human-readable, and directly defined without any external input handling or execution logic. No obfuscated code, no code injection, no malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module only provides static type definitions for AWS WAFv2 related strings, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward, benign type annotation file meant to aid static type checking.",
