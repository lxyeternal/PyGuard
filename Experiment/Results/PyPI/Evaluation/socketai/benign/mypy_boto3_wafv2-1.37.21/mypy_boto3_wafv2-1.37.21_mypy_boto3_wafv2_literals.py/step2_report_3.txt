  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, logical flaws, or overlooked risks.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS WAFv2 and related AWS services.\n- It imports 'Literal' conditionally based on Python version, then assigns numerous string literals to type aliases.\n- The purpose is to facilitate type checking, improve code clarity, and reduce errors.\n- All data are hardcoded, static, and human-readable.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or external data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **No.** All reports agree that the code is static, benign, and solely for type annotations.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears correct in its purpose and implementation.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** Malware and security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific observations:\n- The code is purely declarative, with no dynamic or external data.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n- The extensive list of string literals is consistent with AWS documentation.\n- The conditional import for 'Literal' is correct and standard practice for compatibility.\n\n### Potential issues or concerns:\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malicious activity:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** None, as no data handling or execution occurs.\n- **Code quality:** Well-structured, with documentation and version compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the static, read-only nature, should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify this as a benign, static type definition module for AWS WAFv2. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** This code is a safe, well-structured static type definition file with no security concerns.",
