{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases using Python's Literal for various AWS WAFv2 service literal values, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python standard library 'sys' for version checking; defines string literals for various AWS-related types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external system calls, or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code purely establishes type aliases and documentation comments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system version info to conditionally import 'Literal' for type annotations, then defines multiple string literal types for AWS services and configurations. It includes a docstring with usage instructions and documentation links. There are no dynamic code executions, data handling, or network activities. All components are static type alias declarations. The code appears to serve as a type definition module for AWS WAFv2 literals, with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured type alias definitions module intended for type safety in AWS-related Python code. It contains no suspicious or malicious elements and appears safe.",
