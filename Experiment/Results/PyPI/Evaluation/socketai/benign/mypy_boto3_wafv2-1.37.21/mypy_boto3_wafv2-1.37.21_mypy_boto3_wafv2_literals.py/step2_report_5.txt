  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining numerous string literal types for AWS WAFv2 and related AWS services.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` from `typing` or `typing_extensions` based on Python version.\n- All data are hardcoded string literals; no dynamic code, user input, or external data handling.\n- No network activity, no data processing, no code execution beyond type aliasing.\n- The purpose is to facilitate static type checking and improve code clarity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, secrets, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the reports:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type alias definitions. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data flows, or suspicious elements.  \n  **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Logical, reasoning, or summary flaws:\n\n- All reports consistently state that the code is benign, static, and solely for type annotations.  \n- They correctly note the absence of data sinks, data flows, or malicious behaviors.  \n- The summaries are accurate and well-justified based on the code content.\n\n**Note:** The reports seem to overstate the purpose as \"security risk\" or \"malware\" but correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate. No malware or malicious activity is detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign `0`, consistent with the straightforward, static nature of the code.  \n- **Risk score:**  \n  All assign `0`, which is correct. No security risk or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nScores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as purely static type definitions.  \n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on speculation; the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and justification:\n\n- The reports are consistent and justified.  \n- They correctly interpret the code's purpose and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation.  \n- Static definitions with no external or dynamic data handling.  \n- No vulnerabilities or security issues identified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThis code is a benign, static type alias module for AWS WAFv2 literals. It serves as a helpful utility for type checking in larger codebases. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n| -------- | ------------ | ----- |\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence presented.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that such static definition modules are maintained securely and that no external code injects or modifies them. But as provided, this code is safe and straightforward.",
