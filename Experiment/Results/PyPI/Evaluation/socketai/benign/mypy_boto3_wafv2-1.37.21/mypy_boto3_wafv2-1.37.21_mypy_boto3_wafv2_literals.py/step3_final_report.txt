{
  "purpose": "This code provides static type alias definitions for AWS WAFv2 string literals, facilitating static type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it consists solely of static string literals assigned to type aliases.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is purely static type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS WAFv2 configurations, with conditional import for compatibility. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or network activity. All signals indicate benign, purely declarative code intended for type annotations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static set of type definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
