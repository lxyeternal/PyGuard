  "purpose": "Define Python literal types for AWS WAFv2 service configuration and other AWS service identifiers to enable type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys and version info; literal definitions assigning string literals to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static literals assigned directly to variables.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from input to output; purely static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code is a straightforward type annotation setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system version info to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', then defines numerous string literal types for AWS services and configurations. It appears to be a static type setup intended to facilitate type checking in a larger project. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static configuration for type annotations related to AWS WAFv2 and other AWS services. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
