  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Static type definitions for AWS WAFv2 literals.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: All static, no external input or output.  \n- Anomalies: None detected.  \n- Analysis: The code is purely static, defining string literal types for AWS WAFv2, with no dynamic behavior, no external data, and no suspicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, straightforward type alias module.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar static type alias definitions for AWS WAFv2.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: All static, no data handling.  \n- Anomalies: None detected.  \n- Analysis: Same as above—static, no dynamic code, no external dependencies or malicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, benign static type definitions.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above—type literals for AWS WAFv2.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static, no data processing.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Identical pattern—static, purely for type annotations.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious activity, safe.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Same—type definitions for AWS WAFv2.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static, no external data.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Consistent with previous, purely static.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, benign.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Same—type literals for AWS WAFv2.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Static, no dynamic or external data.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Same pattern—static, purely for type checking.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious elements.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports describe a static, human-readable set of type alias definitions for AWS WAFv2 string literals.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or network activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The code's purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking and code clarity.\n- All malware scores are zero, and the security risk is negligible.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is a benign, well-structured static type definitions module.\n- No indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The high confidence scores are justified given the consistent pattern and absence of suspicious activity.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The code appears safe and suitable for its intended purpose.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and my analysis.",
