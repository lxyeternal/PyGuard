  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS WAFv2 service integration in Python for type checking.",
  "sources": "Literal type definitions assigned to variables such as ActionValueType, CountryCodeType, etc.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform data processing, I/O, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code consists solely of static type annotations and definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version-specific typing modules and defines multiple string Literal types for AWS WAFv2. It is solely intended for static type checking support. There are no inputs, outputs, network activities, or data transformations. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The copyright notice and documentation link are benign and standard. No malicious behavior or malware patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type alias definitions for AWS WAFv2 service literals. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It serves as a type hinting aid for developers. No security issues identified.",
