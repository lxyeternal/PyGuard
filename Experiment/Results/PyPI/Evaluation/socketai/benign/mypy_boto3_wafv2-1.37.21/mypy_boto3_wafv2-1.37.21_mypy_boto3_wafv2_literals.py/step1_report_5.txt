  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS WAFv2 service string values to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "String literals defining allowed values for different types, imported modules (sys and typing).",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines constants and imports; no data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is solely declarative with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward type definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, and declares multiple type aliases with string literal values for AWS WAFv2 service types. No dynamic code execution, external data input, or side effects are present. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions intended for type hinting in a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, declarative module providing type annotations for AWS WAFv2 literals. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It serves as a utility for better type safety in AWS SDK codebases.",
