{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS WAFv2 service type definitions, aimed at facilitating static type checking and API data modeling.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from imported modules, system version info for conditional imports, and constants from literals modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input data directly. It defines data models and type unions used elsewhere in application logic.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks, as this module only provides type annotations and data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes license information with a future date ('2025') which may be intentionally misleading or outdated. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious file operations. Usage of unions and conditional imports is consistent with type annotation best practices. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict definitions, type unions, and conditional imports based on Python version. It defines complex data models for AWS WAFv2 service interactions, with no code execution or data processing logic. No dynamic or obfuscated code segments, malicious payloads, or external network calls are detected. The presence of date '2025' in license comments is unusual but not malicious; it could be placeholder or hypothetical data. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured type annotation module intended for static typing support.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign collection of type definitions and data structures used for AWS WAFv2 SDK in Python. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident from its content. It serves purely as a static type modeling library with no runtime code or data handling logic.",
