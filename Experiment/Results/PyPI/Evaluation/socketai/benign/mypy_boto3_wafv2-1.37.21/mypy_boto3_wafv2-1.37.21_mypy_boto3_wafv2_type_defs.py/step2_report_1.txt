  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes static type definitions for AWS WAFv2, no dynamic or external data sources involved.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data flows; purely static schemas.\n- **Anomalies:** No credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only unusual element is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations, serving as schemas for data validation. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n**Security risk:** 0.0\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations for AWS SDK, with standard imports and union types.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are from inputs into data models, no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, modeling data structures for static type checking, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n**Security risk:** 0.0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—type annotations for AWS WAFv2, no runtime or external data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows or system modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** The copyright date is again set to 2025, which is inconsistent with current date but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a static set of type definitions, with no executable or malicious intent.\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n**Security risk:** 0.0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines data schemas for AWS WAFv2 SDK, standard imports, and conditional typing for compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data sources; only data models.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; use of standard typing practices. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely static type annotations for SDK validation, safe and benign.\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n**Security risk:** 0.0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others—type annotations for AWS WAFv2, no dynamic code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data processing or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** The only notable point is the copyright date 2025, which may be placeholder or placeholder-like but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a static collection of type definitions, serving as a schema, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n**Security risk:** 0.0\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is static, purely declarative, consisting of type annotations, union types, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or dynamic execution.\n- **Potential Anomalies:** The future date 2025 in comments and license headers is unusual but not harmful—likely placeholder or generated data.\n- **Data Flow & Sinks:** No external network, file, or system modification actions are present.\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** — purely static type definitions with no security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a well-structured, static type annotation module for AWS WAFv2 SDK in Python. It contains no malicious activity, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence and absence of obfuscation or malware confirm its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The current scoring and analysis are appropriate.",
