  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is static type definitions for AWS WAFv2, with no external data handling, network activity, or runtime logic. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, relying on Python typing constructs. The mention of a future date (2025) in the copyright is noted but not suspicious.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.0 — no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is a well-structured static schema for type checking, with no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the data modeling nature of the code. No dynamic or malicious behavior, just type annotations for AWS SDK.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis rightly points out the absence of runtime logic, external data sources, or network activity. The use of conditional imports and version checks is standard.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.0 — no malicious indicators.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is solely for static type annotations, with no external data or runtime actions. Notes the future copyright date as unusual but not malicious.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly recognizes the code's purpose as a type schema, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.0 — no malicious signs.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely declarative code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Focuses on the data modeling aspect, with no executable logic or network activity. Highlights the extensive use of type unions and conditional imports.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid; the code is a comprehensive set of type annotations for AWS WAFv2, with no runtime or external data handling.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.0 — no suspicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, static type definition module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others, noting the code is mainly type annotations, with no processing of untrusted data or external calls. Mentions the future date in license info as unusual but not malicious.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is a collection of type definitions, serving as a static schema for AWS SDK in Python.  \n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.0 — no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured type annotations.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is static, defining data structures with Python typing, specifically for AWS WAFv2 SDK.  \n- **Malicious Indicators:** None of the reports detect any malicious code, obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Potential Concerns:** The only unusual aspect is the copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (2024). This could suggest placeholder data or a generated template, but it does not imply malicious intent.  \n- **Data Flow & Sinks:** No runtime data processing, network activity, or external system modifications are present. The code is purely declarative.\n\n### Final Scores & Justification\n\n| Aspect | Estimated Score | Justification |\n|---------|------------------|----------------|\n| **Malware** | **0.0** | No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads. The code is static type annotations. |\n| **Obfuscated** | **0.0** | No obfuscation techniques detected; code is straightforward type definitions. |\n| **Risk** | **0.0** | No runtime logic, external data handling, or vulnerabilities. The only oddity is the future date in comments, which is benign. |\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS WAFv2 SDK data models. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are present. It appears to be a generated or library code meant for static type checking, with no executable or external data handling involved.\n\n**Final recommendations:** No changes needed; the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
