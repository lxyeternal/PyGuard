{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS WAFv2 service type definitions, including request and response structures, configurations, and rule components.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from type annotations, constants imports, and standard Python libraries; it reads static class and type definitions, with no external input handling.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted data, external network communication, or system modifications; all data appears confined within type definitions and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; type definitions serve as schemas for data structures without runtime data processing or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors; it predominantly consists of static type definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines TypedDict classes, unions, and constants for AWS WAFv2 type annotations. It includes version checks for Python compatibility, imports of standard and third-party libraries, and comprehensive docstrings. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is present. All elements serve as static type schemas. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious imports are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, schema-definition module for AWS WAFv2 type annotations, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured for its purpose, and no vulnerabilities or sabotage are detected.",
