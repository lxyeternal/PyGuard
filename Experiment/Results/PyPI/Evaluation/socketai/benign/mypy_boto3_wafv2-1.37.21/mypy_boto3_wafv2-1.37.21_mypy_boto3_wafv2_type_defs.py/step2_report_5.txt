  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the provided code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as static type definitions for AWS WAFv2, with no dynamic or external data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data flows or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation; the only unusual point is the future copyright date (2025).\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely static, schema-like, and intended for type checking. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, emphasizing the data modeling aspect.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of malicious data flow; the code models request/response schemas.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; use of sys.version_info is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a static set of type annotations, with no runtime logic or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, focusing on static type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data exfiltration or malicious flows; purely data schemas.\n- **Anomalies:** The only notable anomaly is the copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future relative to current date (2024). This could be a placeholder or oversight but isn't malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic or malicious code; it's a static type definition module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clarifies the code as type annotations for AWS WAFv2 SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data processing; only data schemas.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; use of conditional imports and unions is standard. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Entirely static, type-focused code with no executable logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, emphasizing the purpose as static data modeling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data handling or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual aspect is the copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future. This might be placeholder or outdated info but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** All zero, consistent with static, schema-only code.\n- **Obfuscated:** Zero; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Zero; no external data, no runtime code, no vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS WAFv2 SDK, serving as a schema for data validation and static type checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date (2025), which is likely placeholder or oversight, not malicious.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code as purely static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary to the existing scores. The code is benign and intended solely for type safety in SDK development.",
