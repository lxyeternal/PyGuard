  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, logical consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static, schema-defining module for AWS WAFv2 type annotations. No dynamic or malicious code, no external data, no network activity. The only unusual point is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely static type definitions. The absence of runtime logic, external data handling, or system modifications confirms no security risks.\n\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Risk scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code models data structures for AWS WAFv2 SDK, with no external or untrusted data sources. No code execution, network activity, or malicious behavior detected. The use of conditional imports and type annotations is standard.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes that the code is purely declarative, with no runtime or external data processing. The mention of the future date in the copyright is noted but not harmful.\n\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations for AWS WAFv2, with no runtime logic, network calls, or external data handling. The only minor anomaly is the future date (2025) in the copyright.\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that the code is benign and solely for static type checking is correct. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** All zero, justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines data models for AWS WAFv2 SDK, with no executable logic, network calls, or data manipulation. The use of conditional imports and extensive union types is standard. No malicious intent detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The detailed analysis aligns with the code's purpose as a static type schema. The mention of the 2025 date is noted but not concerning.\n\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code consists of type definitions for AWS WAFv2, primarily reading from imported modules and version info. No external data processing or malicious behavior. The future date (2025) in the license comment is unusual but not malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that the code is a benign static type module is correct. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present.\n\n- **Scores:** All zero, justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0.0. The code contains no executable or network activity, only static type definitions.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports report 0.0. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as the code is purely static, schema-defining, with no external or runtime actions.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The only minor anomaly is the copyright date 2025, which is in the future relative to current date (2024). This could be a placeholder or a typo, but it does not pose any security risk.\n\n- The extensive use of unions and conditional imports is standard for compatibility and type safety, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on all reports and the detailed analysis, I concur that:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\n**The code is a benign, well-structured static type definition module for AWS WAFv2 SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.**",
