  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS WAFv2 service type definitions, serving as schemas for data validation and static type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports, type definitions, union types, conditional imports based on Python version, constants, and comments.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications; purely static data schemas.",
  "flows": "None; data flows are from input annotations into type schemas with no runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual element is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future, likely a placeholder or generated data, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class and type definitions using Python's TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for compatibility. No executable code, dynamic data handling, or external interactions are present. The use of union types and version-based imports is standard for SDK schema definitions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static schema module for AWS WAFv2 SDK in Python, with no malicious activity, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor anomaly is the future date in comments, which does not impact security.",
