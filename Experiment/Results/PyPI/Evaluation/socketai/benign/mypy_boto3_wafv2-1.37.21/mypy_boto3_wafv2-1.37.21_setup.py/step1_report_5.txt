{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the 'mypy-boto3-wafv2' Python package, defining its metadata, dependencies, and distribution options.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description; reads static package metadata such as name, version, author info, classifiers, keywords, URLs, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; no external inputs or untrusted sources are processed at runtime.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: reading static files and defining package metadata, which does not involve untrusted data or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected. The script appears to follow standard setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script importing 'setuptools' and reading a markdown file for the description. All metadata is hardcoded or read from static files. No dynamic execution, environment variable usage, or untrusted input processing is present. The dependencies are clearly specified with a conditional, and URLs are static. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs standard package configuration tasks without processing untrusted data or executing suspicious code.",
