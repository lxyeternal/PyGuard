{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-wafv2 Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; static data for package configuration; user-provided package name, version, author info, URLs, classifiers, dependencies, etc.",
  "targets": "No dynamic or untrusted input sources present; no data flows from external sources to critical sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Use of Path and setuptools is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library. It reads a README file for the long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All code is static with no external input handling or data processing that could lead to security risks. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
