  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library. The code reads a static README.md file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs, and calls `setup()` from setuptools. There are no dynamic inputs, user inputs, or external data flows that could introduce security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the script is static, straightforward, and follows standard conventions. The only minor note is the copyright year (2025), which appears to be a future date—likely a typo or placeholder—but this is not a security concern.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since there's no obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no malicious code or behavior is present.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis—no external data, no code execution, no network activity, no secrets.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**  \n   - No suspicious assumptions are made about the code.  \n   - The only point to note is the future copyright year, which is not malicious but might be a typo.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the script.\n\n6. **Additional Expert Judgment:**  \n   Based on the code and reports, I concur that the malware score should be 0, obfuscated remains 0, and overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**Final Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or security issues.",
