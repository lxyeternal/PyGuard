{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures a Python package called mypy-boto3-wafv2 for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; no other data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions; setup configuration parameters are hardcoded constants.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the flow is primarily static configuration and file reading.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets; the copyright date (2025) appears inconsistent with the current year but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It reads the README.md file for the long description and then calls setup() with static parameters such as package name, version, author details, classifiers, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The only external operation is reading a local file, which is typical and safe in setup scripts. The version and URLs are consistent with package publishing purposes. The copyright date being in the future (2025) may be a typo or placeholder but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
