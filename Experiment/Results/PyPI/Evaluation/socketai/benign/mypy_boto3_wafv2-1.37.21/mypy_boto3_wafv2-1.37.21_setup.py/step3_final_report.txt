  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-wafv2 Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads static README.md file for long description; uses hardcoded package metadata and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration without external input.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static assignment of package info and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) noted, likely a placeholder; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup.py script for Python packaging. It reads a local README file and calls setuptools.setup() with fixed parameters. No user input, environment variables, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code follows best practices and contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. All indicators confirm its safety and correctness.",
