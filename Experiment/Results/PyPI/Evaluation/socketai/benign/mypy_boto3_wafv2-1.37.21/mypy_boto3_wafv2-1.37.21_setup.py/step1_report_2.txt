  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up and install the 'mypy-boto3-wafv2' Python package, including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; uses static values for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or user input; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration data remains internal with no external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'Path' for reading a README file, then calls 'setup()' with static package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used dynamically. No code injection, network calls, or credential handling is present. The content is typical for a Python package setup and contains no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
