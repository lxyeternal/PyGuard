{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-wafv2' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call, which installs package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content -> setup() call which processes package info and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard setup script components and clear metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It reads a README file, specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. No external or untrusted data is processed dynamically, no command execution, and no suspicious code segments are present. The only external file read is the static README.md, which is typical and safe. All dependencies are explicitly listed. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or anomalies identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal, benign Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
