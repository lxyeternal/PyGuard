{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for AWS WAFv2 SDK, serving as static type hints and interface declarations for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, class properties, and documentation references; no runtime data sources or external input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; methods invoke AWS API calls with predefined parameters, no external data processing or output manipulation.",
  "flows": "Method calls flow into AWS API endpoints; no internal data flow or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; code is purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS WAFv2, with no executable logic, data manipulation, or runtime behavior. It consists of method signatures, documentation references, and class properties, serving as a stub for type checking and API interaction. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are appropriately set to zero, reflecting its benign, declarative nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The current scores are justified and accurate, indicating no need for modification.",
