  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of code issues, logical flaws, malware potential, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely static type annotations and class definitions for AWS WAFv2 client interactions. No runtime logic, data processing, or executable code exists. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Reasonable.**\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; the code is a well-structured stub with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the static nature, proper type annotations, and absence of malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Appropriate.**\n- **Conclusion:** Valid reasoning; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the focus is on the static, type-safe interface. No malicious logic, data leaks, or suspicious code are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Correct.**\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Continues the pattern of recognizing the code as a type-annotated SDK wrapper with no embedded logic or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Appropriate.**\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, confirming the code is a standard, safe SDK interface with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Reasonable.**\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly note that the code is static, type annotations, and method signatures without runtime logic.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or hidden code.\n- **Security risk:** The code is a standard SDK interface, which by design is safe.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, I agree with the assigned scores: malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a legitimate, static SDK interface with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- No modifications needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is a secure, standard SDK stub with no malware or obfuscation.",
