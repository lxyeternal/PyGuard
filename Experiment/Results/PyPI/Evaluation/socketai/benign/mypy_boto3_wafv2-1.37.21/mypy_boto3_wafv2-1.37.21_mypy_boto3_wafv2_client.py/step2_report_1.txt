  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if there are any security concerns, inconsistencies, or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a static type annotation and client class definition for AWS WAFv2, with no runtime logic or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that there is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk is accurate. The code is purely declarative, serving as a stub/interface.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence, no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No security issues. The score for malware and obfuscation is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that this is a type annotation and SDK interface without malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a well-structured SDK wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — absolute confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** No security issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a type-annotated interface for AWS WAFv2, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes that the code is a set of method signatures wrapping AWS API calls, with no embedded logic or data manipulation.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high certainty.\n\n**Verdict:** No security concerns. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that the code is a type-annotated SDK wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code only calls AWS APIs with no suspicious data flows or obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — very high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** No malware or obfuscation. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above — a standard, type-safe SDK interface with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is purely declarative with no runtime logic or external data effects.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — complete confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** No security issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports consistently identify that the code is a static, type-annotated interface for AWS WAFv2, with no executable logic, no data leaks, no obfuscation, and no malware. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all correctly set to zero.\n\n**My own assessment aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely declarative, serving as a stub/interface for type checking and SDK interaction. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThis code is a safe, well-structured SDK interface, suitable for static type checking and API interactions, with no security concerns detected.",
