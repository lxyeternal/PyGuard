{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and a class interface for interacting with the AWS WAFv2 service via boto3, enabling type-checked API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type definitions; class attributes and method signatures with request/response types.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations invoke AWS API operations via boto3, primarily passing and returning data through method parameters and responses.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) flows from method calls into API requests; responses from AWS are returned as method outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections to unknown domains, or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. Use of type annotations and method signatures aligns with standard SDK patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a client class for AWS WAFv2 with type annotations for method parameters and return types, facilitating static type checking. The class methods are wrappers around boto3 API calls, with no embedded logic that manipulates data or interacts with the system outside the API requests. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data leakage, hidden network activity, or backdoors. The presence of type definitions and proper exception handling hints at robust SDK usage, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a type-annotated interface for the AWS WAFv2 boto3 client, designed for safe, predictable API interactions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It appears to be a legitimate SDK wrapper, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
