{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS WAFv2 service in boto3, providing method signatures for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore, and local module .type_defs; class attribute definitions; method parameters unpacked from type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations call AWS API endpoints via boto3, with no direct data sinks or external data effects evident within this code.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (unpacked from type definitions) flow into AWS API calls through boto3, but actual request content is not specified here; no malicious data flows are detectable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code strictly defines an API client interface with no runtime logic or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class definitions, method signatures, and documentation links. It sets up a structured client interface for AWS WAFv2, with no executable logic, data processing, or external data handling within this fragment. It does not include any code that could be used maliciously, such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful commands. The presence of detailed exception types and method signatures aligns with standard SDK interface patterns, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured interface for AWS WAFv2 in boto3-stubs, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and purely declarative in nature.",
