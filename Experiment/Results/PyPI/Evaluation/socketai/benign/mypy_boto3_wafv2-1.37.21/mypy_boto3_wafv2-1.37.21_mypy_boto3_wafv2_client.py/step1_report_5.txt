  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the AWS WAFv2 service in boto3, facilitating type-safe interactions with the AWS WAFv2 API.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type definitions; class and method definitions with parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "Methods calling AWS services, potentially transmitting data to AWS endpoints, but only via standard SDK procedures. No data is read from untrusted sources or written to untrusted destinations within this code.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (unpacked type definitions) pass data from callers to AWS API endpoints. Return values are data received from AWS services. No untrusted data handling or external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code adheres to standard SDK patterns. No unusual obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables detected. License and copyright notices are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK wrapper with type annotations for the boto3 WAFv2 client. It primarily defines a client class with methods mapping to AWS API calls, along with exception handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors. The code does not perform any system modifications, network connections outside AWS API interactions, or other malicious activities. It appears to be a legitimate, type-safe interface implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate SDK interface with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It provides type-safe access to AWS WAFv2 services without any malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
