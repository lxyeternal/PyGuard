  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a static type annotation and client class definition for AWS WAFv2, with no runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated/Security Risk:** Clearly zero.\n- **Validity:** The report correctly identifies that this is a stub/interface, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's confidence (0.95) and findings are accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a type-annotated client interface with method signatures for AWS WAFv2.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated/Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Validity:** Correctly notes the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, with high confidence (1). No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a type-annotated SDK wrapper with no runtime logic or malicious activity.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated/Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Validity:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious patterns are detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, high confidence (1). No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern: type annotations and method signatures for API calls, no embedded logic.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated/Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Validity:** Correct interpretation; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, with high confidence (0.95). No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, a standard SDK interface with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated/Security Risk:** Zero.\n- **Validity:** The analysis is appropriate; no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, high confidence (1). No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Presence:** All reports confirm the code is purely type annotations and interface definitions for AWS SDK.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** No evidence of security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores Justification:** All scores of malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriately set to 0, given the static, declarative nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a well-structured, static SDK interface with no malicious or security issues. The scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
