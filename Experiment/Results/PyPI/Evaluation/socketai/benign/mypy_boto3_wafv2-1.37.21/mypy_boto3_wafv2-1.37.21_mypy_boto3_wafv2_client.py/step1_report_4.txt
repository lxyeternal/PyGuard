  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 WAFV2 service client, facilitating type-safe interactions with AWS WAFv2.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore, typing, and local type_defs; class and method definitions with parameters and return types; constants and properties defining client behavior.",
  "sinks": "Methods calling AWS APIs, handling untrusted input via **kwargs, and returning data types that may contain untrusted data; no direct data leaks or insecure operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (via **kwargs) pass through to AWS service calls; return types include response data from AWS. No explicit untrusted data flows are visible outside API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Method definitions align with standard boto3 client structure.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured, type-annotated wrapper around the boto3 WAFV2 client, enabling type safety for AWS API interactions. It defines exception handling classes, the main client class with methods mapped to AWS WAFV2 operations, and conditional imports for compatibility. All methods serve as pass-through wrappers calling AWS APIs with untrusted input handled via **kwargs, which is typical for SDK wrappers. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be an autogenerated or well-structured SDK interface with standard patterns, and no vulnerabilities are apparent within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured, type-annotated interface for AWS WAFV2 SDK interactions, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It acts as a type-safe wrapper around boto3, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
