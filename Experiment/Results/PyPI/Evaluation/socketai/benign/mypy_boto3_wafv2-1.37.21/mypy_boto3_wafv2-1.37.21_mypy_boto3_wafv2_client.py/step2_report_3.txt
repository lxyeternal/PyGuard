  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security issues, malware, obfuscation, and logical flaws.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely static type annotations and class definitions for the AWS WAFv2 client, with no runtime logic or data processing.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** None detected. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The overall security risk is minimal, given the static nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's content. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that this is an interface with method signatures and no runtime logic.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Zero malware and obfuscation scores are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a safe, well-structured SDK interface.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reinforces that the code is a type-annotated client wrapper with no embedded logic.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Scores are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard SDK code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Highlights that methods are simple wrappers around AWS API calls, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** No issues.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Scores are consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, emphasizing the code's nature as a standard, type-safe SDK wrapper.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Appropriately zero.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** Static, type-annotated interface for AWS WAFv2 SDK, with no executable logic, data manipulation, or runtime behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Security Risks:** None apparent. The code is a standard SDK stub with documentation references.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is a safe, static SDK interface with no security concerns.",
