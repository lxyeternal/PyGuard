{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for interacting with AWS WAFv2 service via boto3, providing methods for managing web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and related resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type definitions; class properties and method signatures for API calls.",
  "sinks": "Method calls, property accesses, and data flows in client methods; no direct sink for untrusted data in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Method parameters unpacked from defined request types, returning various response types; no untrusted data source or dangerous data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is purely type annotations and method definitions with docstrings referencing external API documentation. No runtime code execution, eval, exec, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class structure, method signatures, and documentation links for AWS WAFv2 client interactions. It does not include actual runtime logic, input handling, or data processing that could be exploited. The methods follow standard API call patterns with type safety, and no suspicious or malicious code constructs are evident. The inclusion of exception class definitions and method signatures aligned with AWS SDK does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static, type-annotated interface for AWS WAFv2 API client, with no executable logic, malicious behaviors, or security risks detected. It is a well-structured stub for AWS service interaction, and does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
