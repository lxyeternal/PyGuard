{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Graph class managing nodes and edges with reactive updates and widget communication.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, class attributes, and internal data structures such as nodes, edges, and widget communication functions.",
  "sinks": "The post() method sends messages to an external widget, potentially exposing data if the widget is malicious.",
  "flows": "Source data (node/edge info or attribute changes) triggers post() messages; no external data exfiltration or code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; standard graph management logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, managing nodes and edges with standard methods. It uses traitlets for reactive attributes and communicates with a widget via post(). No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The messaging system could be misused if the widget is compromised, but this is external to the code's logic. The security risk is minimal, primarily associated with untrusted widget environments, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured graph management class with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The potential security concern is limited to widget communication, which is typical in visualization contexts. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
