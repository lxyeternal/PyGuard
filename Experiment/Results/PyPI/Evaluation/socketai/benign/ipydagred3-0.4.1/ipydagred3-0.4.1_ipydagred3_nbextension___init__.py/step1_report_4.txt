  "purpose": "Defines a function that returns configuration paths for a Jupyter Notebook extension.",
  "sources": "The function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() that returns a static list of dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external calls.",
  "flows": "The function simply returns static data; no data flows from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code appears to be standard configuration for a Jupyter extension.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward function returning a hardcoded list of dictionaries specifying extension paths. There are no inputs from external sources, no network or file operations, and no code obfuscation or dynamic execution. The structure is typical for Jupyter Notebook extension setup. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard configuration function for a Jupyter Notebook extension. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security issues.",
