  "purpose": "Provides static configuration paths for a Jupyter Notebook extension.",
  "sources": "Static return statement within the _jupyter_nbextension_paths() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration data only.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving external inputs; static data returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function returning a static list of dictionaries specifying extension paths. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code aligns with standard Jupyter extension configuration practices, and the absence of dynamic or external data interactions indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration snippet for a Jupyter Notebook extension with no malicious intent or security risks.",
