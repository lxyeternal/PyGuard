  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The original code is a simple function returning static configuration data. All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and standard for Jupyter extension configuration. There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, or data processing. Based on the code and reports, **no issues or vulnerabilities are present**.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports uniformly conclude benignity, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies. They correctly identify that the code is static configuration data, not processing untrusted input, and not executing any malicious behavior. No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. These seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports agree the code is benign with no malicious intent, the risk score should remain at 0. The current assignment of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity, such as executing untrusted code, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly interpret the code as static configuration data. There are no unwarranted assumptions; the reasoning is sound.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. Given the benign and static nature of the code, all scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, benign configuration function for a Jupyter Notebook extension. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate and do not require any revisions.",
