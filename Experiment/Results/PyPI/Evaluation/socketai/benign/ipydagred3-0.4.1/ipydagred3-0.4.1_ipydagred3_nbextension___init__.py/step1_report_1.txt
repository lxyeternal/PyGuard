  "purpose": "Define the paths for a Jupyter Notebook extension to load its static files and require statement.",
  "sources": "The function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() which returns a list of dictionaries specifying extension configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "The function output is static and hardcoded; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors; straightforward configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that returns static configuration data for a Jupyter Notebook extension. There are no inputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The data appears to be standard extension metadata, with no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as configuration metadata for a Jupyter Notebook extension. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
