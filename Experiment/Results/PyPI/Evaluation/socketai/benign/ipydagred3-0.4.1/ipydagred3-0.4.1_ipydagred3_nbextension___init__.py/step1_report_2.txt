  "purpose": "Define the Jupyter Notebook extension paths for the ipydagred3 extension.",
  "sources": "Function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() returning a list of dictionaries with extension path info.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "The function returns static data; no flow of untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows standard extension path definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function returning a static list of dictionaries specifying extension directories and require paths. There is no dynamic input, no data processing, and no execution of untrusted code. The structure appears consistent with Jupyter extension configuration. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet for a Jupyter Notebook extension. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
