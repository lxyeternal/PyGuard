  "purpose": "Define Jupyter notebook extension paths for a specific IPython widget or extension.",
  "sources": "Function _jupyter_nbextension_paths() returning a list of dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or could leak data; the code mainly returns static data.",
  "flows": "The function returns static configuration data; no dynamic data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns a static list of dictionaries specifying extension paths for Jupyter notebook. The data appears to be configuration information, not user input or untrusted data. No external network calls, no credential handling, and no dynamic code execution are present. The structure is simple, and the content is typical for Jupyter extension configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to be a benign configuration snippet for Jupyter notebook extensions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
