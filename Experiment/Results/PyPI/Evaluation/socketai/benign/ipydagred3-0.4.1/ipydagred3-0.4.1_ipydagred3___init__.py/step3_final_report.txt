{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a package initialization or setup module, importing internal components such as version info, widgets, Jupyter extension paths, and graph-related classes for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (_version, widget, nbextension, graph, edge, node).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules without dynamic data flow or external data handling; no source-to-sink data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements typical for package setup, with no network activity, data processing, or dynamic execution. All reviews correctly identify its benign nature. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
