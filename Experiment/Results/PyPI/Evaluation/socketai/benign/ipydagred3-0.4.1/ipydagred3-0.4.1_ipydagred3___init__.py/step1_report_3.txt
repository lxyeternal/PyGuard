{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package defining various modules such as Graph, Edge, Node, and widget components, likely for visualization or diagram purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing internal modules and version information, specifically '_version', 'widget', '_jupyter_nbextension_paths', 'graph', 'edge', and 'node'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input; the code primarily involves importing internal components.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and does not execute any data processing or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or hidden behaviors detected; the code consists solely of import statements and a version import.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several internal modules and a version string, which is standard for Python packages. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are typical for a package's __init__.py or module entry point, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an initialization or import declaration for a package. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this fragment.",
