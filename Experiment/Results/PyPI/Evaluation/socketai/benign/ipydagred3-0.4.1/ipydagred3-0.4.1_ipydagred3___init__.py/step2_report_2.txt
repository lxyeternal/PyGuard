  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from internal modules.\n- No external data processing, network communication, or file I/O is mentioned.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are identified.\n- The code appears to be part of a package's initialization or setup script, likely for a graph visualization library in a Jupyter environment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The actual code snippet confirms these reports: it only contains import statements from internal modules (`_version`, `widget`, `nbextension`, `graph`, `edge`, `node`).\n- No evidence of data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, code is straightforward.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity is present.\n- **Security risk score (0):** Correct, no risks are evident.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since all reports and the code indicate benign, static import statements, raising scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score remains at 0 because there is no malicious intent or behavior.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard import section for a Python package, with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the evidence.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
