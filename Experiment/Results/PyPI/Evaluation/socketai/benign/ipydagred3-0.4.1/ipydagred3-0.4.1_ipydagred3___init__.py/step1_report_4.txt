{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package module, mainly importing components such as version info, widgets, Jupyter notebook extensions, and graph-related classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and packages (_version, widget, nbextension, graph, edge, node)",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted inputs; imports are static and do not process external data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing internal modules or classes from the same package. There is no code execution, data processing, or external data input. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident. The code serves as an initialization or import setup for a package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module import setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data or perform any dangerous operations. The code is benign and typical for a Python package's “__init__.py” file.",
