  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content:**  \n   The code snippet is simply:\n   ```python\n   __version__ = \"0.4.1\"\n   ```\n   This is a standard practice in Python packages to declare the version number.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward version assignment with no input, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious constructs. There are no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious indicators in the code.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this is benign, standard version declaration code with no security implications.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the simplicity.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   \n   The scores seem reasonable and aligned with the code's content.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**  \n   Since the code is only a version string assignment, any claim of potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent based solely on this snippet is unfounded. No assumptions are made beyond the code's content.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Justification:**  \n   The reports are consistent, and their conclusions are justified. No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the uniformity and simplicity of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code snippet is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's purpose and content.",
