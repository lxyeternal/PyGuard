  "purpose": "Assigns the version number for the Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string assigned to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process input or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the assignment is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is a straightforward assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string to __version__, with no input, external calls, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is purely declarative, and it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports and scores are accurate and consistent; no further action or adjustments are necessary.",
