{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a setup shim to invoke setuptools' setup function for package installation.",
  "sources": "The __import__('setuptools').setup() call which loads the setuptools module and executes its setup function.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function can process input data such as package metadata, but in this code, it is invoked with default parameters, so no direct sink with untrusted data is evident.",
  "flows": "The script imports setuptools and immediately calls setup(), passing no arguments. There are no explicit data flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward. It does not contain obfuscated elements, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script that imports the setuptools package and calls its setup() function with default parameters. There are no user inputs, environment variable reads, or external data sources. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable. It is a typical pattern used for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware or obfuscation and appears safe.",
