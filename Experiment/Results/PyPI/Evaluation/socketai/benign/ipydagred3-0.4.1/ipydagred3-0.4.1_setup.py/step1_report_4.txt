  "purpose": "This code serves as a setup script for Python packaging, primarily to facilitate installation of a package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports the setuptools module and calls its setup() function.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process user input or external data.",
  "flows": "The script executes a direct import of setuptools and then calls setup(), with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for Python package setup. No unusual variables, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical minimal setup.py file that imports setuptools and invokes setup() to prepare the package configuration. There are no sources of untrusted data, no data flows, and no suspicious code. It does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and standard for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a legitimate purpose for packaging, with no anomalies or malware indicators.",
