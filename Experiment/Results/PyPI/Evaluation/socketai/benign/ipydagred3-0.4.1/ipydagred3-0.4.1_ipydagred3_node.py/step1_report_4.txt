  "purpose": "Define a Node class with traits for graph visualization, enabling attribute validation and change notifications.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, trait attribute changes, default values, and method inputs.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that notify the graph of changes, attribute validation logic, and data returned by to_dict.",
  "flows": "Constructor parameters -> trait attributes -> _notify_change calls -> to_dict output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns. Usage of traitlets for validation and observing is standard. No external data sources or network interactions present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements a class for managing graph nodes with attributes and change notifications. It uses traitlets for property validation and observation, ensuring attribute values are constrained and changes are propagated. The constructor initializes attributes and manages default values. Validation ensures 'shape' is within predefined options. The to_dict method assembles the node data into a dictionary, including attributes and labels. No external input, no file/network access, and no suspicious code behaviors are present. The code appears well-structured, standard, and intended for safe data management within a graph visualization context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for managing graph nodes with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It uses standard Python traitlets features for validation and observation without any malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies.",
