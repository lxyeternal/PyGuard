  "purpose": "Define a Node class for graph visualization with traits, validation, and change notification.",
  "sources": "Input data for attributes such as name, label, shape, tooltip, and attrs during class instantiation and attribute updates.",
  "targets": "Methods that notify the graph of attribute changes (_notify_change). Potentially unsafe if the graph's _notify_change method is compromised, but not directly malicious here.",
  "flows": "Attribute updates (name, label, shape, tooltip, attrs) -> _notify_change calls -> graph's _notify_change method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of traitlets for validation and notification is standard. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Node' with attributes and validation. It uses traitlets for reactive attribute management, with validation for 'shape'. The '_notify_change' method signals changes to an associated graph object. No external input handling, network calls, or suspicious logic present. No anomalies in code flow, data handling, or structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a graph node with traits and change notifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this module. The use of traitlets and class design is typical for such purposes.",
