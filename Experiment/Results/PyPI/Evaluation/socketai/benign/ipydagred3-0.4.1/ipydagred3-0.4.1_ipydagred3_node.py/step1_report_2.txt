  "purpose": "Define a Node class for graph visualization with attributes such as name, label, shape, tooltip, and attrs, along with change notification mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Constructor (__init__) method and property setters for name, label, shape, tooltip, attrs",
  "sinks": "Change notification method (_notify_change) invoked during attribute changes; potential external integrations via _graph object",
  "flows": "Attribute change triggers observer methods, which invoke _notify_change, passing attribute name and new value",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or malicious code patterns. Usage of traitlets appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Node class that extends HasTraits for reactive attributes. It includes property validations and observers to notify changes. No input sources such as user input, network, or external files are present. The _notify_change method interacts with a _graph object, but its implementation is not provided, so potential external risks cannot be assessed. The attribute validation ensures only allowed shapes are used, preventing invalid data. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be a standard data structure with change tracking, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a graph node with attribute validation and change notification. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It seems safe and benign, assuming external interactions via _graph are secure.",
