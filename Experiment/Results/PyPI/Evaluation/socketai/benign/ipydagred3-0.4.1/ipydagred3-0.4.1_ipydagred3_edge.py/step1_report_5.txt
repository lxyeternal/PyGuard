  "purpose": "Define an Edge class for graph representation, encapsulating nodes and visual/behavioral attributes.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (v, w, label, tooltip, attrs), attribute setters (e.g., label, tooltip, attrs), observe methods",
  "sinks": "Notify change method (_notify_change), validation of labelpos, to_dict method (reads attributes)",
  "flows": "Constructor assigns attributes -> _notify_change called on attribute changes -> to_dict accesses attributes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual code patterns. Use of traits and observe is standard for reactive properties.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with attribute validation, observer callbacks, and serialization to dictionary. No suspicious external network calls, no handling of untrusted input sources, and no dynamic code execution observed. Validation ensures labelpos is within expected values. The notify mechanism relies on an associated _graph object, which is not present, but this alone is not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a typical data structure implementation with standard traits and observer pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a graph edge with attribute management and change notification. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or malware. The code's design is straightforward, with no suspicious external interactions or obfuscation.",
