  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic execution functions (exec(), eval()), hardcoded credentials, network activity, obfuscation segments, input data flows.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, data leaks, execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input data or environment variables leading to sinks like network sockets, file writes, or code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Moderate obfuscation (score 0.4), dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, inconsistent or unnecessary complexity.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with some hardcoded credentials and network activity suggesting malicious intent. The suspicion is supported by the presence of obfuscation and code execution functions. Benign code lacks these features and shows no suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware 0.65, obfuscated 0.4, security risk 0.75) in Report 1 are justified by these indicators. Other reports correctly identify benign or insufficient data, with low scores aligned with their findings. The overall assessment indicates that only Report 1 exhibits moderate malicious potential, while others are safe.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's moderate suspicion is justified by obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting higher malware and risk scores. The remaining reports are consistent with benign code. No adjustments are necessary; the scores accurately reflect the evidence.",
