  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1's moderate suspicion is justified by obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting higher malware and risk scores. The remaining reports are consistent with benign code. No adjustments are necessary; the scores accurately reflect the evidence."
