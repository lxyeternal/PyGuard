Data is also taken from function parameters such as 'pattern' and 'data'.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Results are stored in variables, and some functions perform pattern matching/substitution. No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations directly, but user-controlled patterns could influence execution. There are no evident data leaks or dangerous sink functions.\",\n  \"flows\": \"Pattern data flows from user-defined patterns into compile and match functions. The data fetched from files is processed with these patterns. There is no evidence of untrusted data influencing security-sensitive sinks.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"Patterns like '(\\[\\[(^\\|)+.*?\\]\\])' are used repeatedly for Wikilinks processing, which is standard regex. The function 'replace_wikilinks' encodes substitution strings but doesn't execute code dynamically. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation are present. Some commented-out code suggests testing for web log patterns but no active malicious behavior.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The script is a performance testing framework for regex modules, with functions for data retrieval and pattern matching/substitution. It imports external modules (re2, re, regex) and performs benchmarking. No evidence of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The patterns and functions are typical for text processing and benchmarking. The code operates within a controlled environment, and no external data or commands are executed unsafely. The only potential concern is that pattern inputs are user-defined, but this is expected in benchmarking contexts and does not constitute malicious behavior.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a benign benchmarking tool designed to compare regex libraries. It reads data from local files, performs pattern matching/substitution, and outputs formatted tables. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful activities. The overall security risk is minimal.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
