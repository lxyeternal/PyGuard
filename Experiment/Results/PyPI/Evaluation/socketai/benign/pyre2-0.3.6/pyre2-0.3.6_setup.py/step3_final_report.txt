  "purpose": "Build configuration script for the 're2' Python extension module using CMake.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (CMAKE_BUILD_OVERRIDE, CMAKE_GENERATOR, CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE), subprocess calls executing 'cmake' commands, package metadata (__version__).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'cmake' and 'cmake --build', directory creation for build artifacts.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence subprocess command arguments and build configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected; standard build script behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build setup for a Python extension using CMake, relying on environment variables for configuration. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Subprocess calls invoke external build tools in a controlled manner. The reliance on environment variables is standard but could be exploited in untrusted environments, which is reflected in the low risk score. No hardcoded secrets or network activity are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard build configuration with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The low security risk stems from environment variable reliance, which is typical for build scripts but warrants caution in untrusted contexts.",
