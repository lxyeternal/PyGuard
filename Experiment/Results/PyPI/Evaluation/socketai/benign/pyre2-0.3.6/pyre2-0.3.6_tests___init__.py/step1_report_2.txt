  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific intent cannot be fully determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input/env/ files) to sinks (system/network/file operations), possibly passing through intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code patterns such as dynamic execution, obfuscated variable names, or hardcoded secrets are absent. No suspicious imports or unexplained code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with standard Python functions and constructs. No evidence of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. The structure suggests legitimate use, but without further context, some behaviors (like dynamic code execution or external network access) cannot be entirely ruled out if present outside the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign, with no suspicious anomalies or malware indicators. Confidence is high in this assessment.",
