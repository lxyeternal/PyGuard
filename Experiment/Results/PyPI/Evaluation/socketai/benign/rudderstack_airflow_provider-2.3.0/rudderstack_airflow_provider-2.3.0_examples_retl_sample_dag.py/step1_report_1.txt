  "purpose": "Define an Airflow DAG to run a Rudderstack RETL operator with template variables for configuration.",
  "sources": "Template variables '{{ var.value.retl_connection_id }}' and '{{ var.value.sync_type }}' used as inputs for the operator.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted outputs are evident; configuration parameters are templated for external input.",
  "flows": "Template variables are injected into the operator, but their source is external (Airflow variables). No untrusted data flow within code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of template variables suggests reliance on external configuration; no hardcoded secrets or credentials. No suspicious code behaviors or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up an Airflow DAG with a single operator that uses external variables for its configuration. The variables are standard Airflow template variables, which could be manipulated via Airflow's variable store but are not inherently malicious. The code appears straightforward and lacks any code injection, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The use of template variables for configuration is typical in Airflow workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Airflow DAG setup using external configuration variables. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The reliance on external variables is common and not malicious in itself.",
