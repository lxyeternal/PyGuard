  "purpose": "Define an Airflow DAG with a single task using external template variables for configuration.",
  "sources": "Airflow variable store for 'retl_connection_id' and 'sync_type' template variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if environment variables or Airflow variables are compromised, external configuration could be manipulated, but no direct sink in code.",
  "flows": "Template variables are injected into operator parameters; no untrusted data flows directly in code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard practices, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Airflow DAG with a single operator, utilizing template variables for configuration. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity are present. The reliance on external variables is typical but warrants proper security practices. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.3) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are evident. The main concern is external variable security, which is a common configuration issue, not an active threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects minimal inherent risk, primarily related to external variable management. Proper security of environment variables is recommended but does not alter the benign assessment.",
