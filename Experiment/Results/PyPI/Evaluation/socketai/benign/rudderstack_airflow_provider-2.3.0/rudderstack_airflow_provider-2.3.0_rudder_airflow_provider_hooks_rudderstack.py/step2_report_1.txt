  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API interaction layer with no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It retrieves tokens securely, handles retries, and performs polling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to external dependencies and connection handling.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; the code appears safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API request handling, secure token retrieval, and polling. No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — still low, considering external configurations.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard API interaction with proper error handling, token management, and polling.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the previous assessments.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the same observations: legitimate API interaction, no obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified given the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable, considering external dependency and configuration management.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — the code is standard API interaction code, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to reliance on external configuration and network interactions, which are typical for such integrations.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code handles tokens securely via Airflow connections.\n- Uses standard libraries (`requests`) with retries and error handling.\n- Implements polling with timeouts, a common pattern.\n- No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads.\n- No suspicious URL manipulations or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's apparent purpose and structure.",
