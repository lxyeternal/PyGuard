  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is straightforward API interaction code with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. It handles tokens securely, uses retries, and polling with timeouts. No suspicious activity detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard API client code, with no signs of malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified given the context.\n\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed. The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is standard API interaction code with proper token handling, retries, and polling. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) is acceptable, considering the potential impact if tokens are compromised, but overall, the code itself is safe.\n\n- **Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client with secure token retrieval, retries, and polling. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The low risk score is justified.\n\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; standard API interaction with secure token handling, retries, and polling. No malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is appropriate. Slightly higher securityRisk score is acceptable.\n\n- **Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a legitimate API client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. It uses secure token retrieval and standard request handling.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, with a score of 0. This is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** The scores range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security risk, primarily due to handling of tokens from external connection configurations, which is standard practice.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports — **appropriate**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all reports — **appropriate**.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Given the code's function and no malicious indicators, a uniform score of **0.1 to 0.2** is reasonable. Slight variations are acceptable but do not significantly impact the overall assessment.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to external token management, which is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
