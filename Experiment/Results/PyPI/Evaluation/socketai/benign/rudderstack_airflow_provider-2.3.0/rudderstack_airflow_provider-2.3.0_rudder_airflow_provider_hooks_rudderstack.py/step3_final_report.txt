  "purpose": "API client classes for interacting with RudderStack's API endpoints, including sync, profile, and ETL operations, with polling and retry mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Retrieving connection tokens from Airflow connections, making HTTP requests to specified endpoints, reading response statuses.",
  "sinks": "Polling endpoints to check status; potential data leaks if tokens or sensitive info are mishandled, but currently secured via connection parameters.",
  "flows": "Secure token retrieval -> API request with headers -> Response handling -> Polling for status -> Timeout or success handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard request handling, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious URL manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API interaction layer with retry and polling logic, using secure token management via Airflow connections. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. Error handling is appropriate, and external dependencies are typical. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external connection configurations. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, consistent across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
