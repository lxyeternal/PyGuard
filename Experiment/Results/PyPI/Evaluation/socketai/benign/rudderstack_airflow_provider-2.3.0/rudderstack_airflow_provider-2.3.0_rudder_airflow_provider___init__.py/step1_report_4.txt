  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() which returns static data; no external data input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; the function simply returns a static dictionary.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is simple and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns static package metadata. It does not read external input, perform any data processing, or execute dynamic code. There are no network operations, no environment variable accesses, or other potentially malicious behaviors. The structure is minimal and standard for static metadata provision.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and performs a simple static data return with no signs of malicious activity. It is typical package metadata code with no security concerns.",
