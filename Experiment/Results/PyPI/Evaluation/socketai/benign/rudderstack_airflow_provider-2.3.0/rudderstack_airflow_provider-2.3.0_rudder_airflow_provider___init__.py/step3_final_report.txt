  "purpose": "Provide static package metadata information for the 'rudderstack-airflow-provider' package.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static return of a dictionary with package name, description, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "None; the function returns static data without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function returning a static dictionary with package metadata. It involves no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or network interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, static, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature mean it poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and provides package metadata without any malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, and there are no security risks or obfuscation present.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
