  "purpose": "Define custom Airflow operators to trigger and monitor Rudderstack sync processes, profiles, and ETL jobs via hooks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as retl_connection_id, profile_id, etl_source_id, connection_id, sync_type, parameters, and other configuration values passed to class constructors and methods.",
  "sinks": "Logging statements that output process information; no data sinks involving untrusted data transmission or storage are apparent.",
  "flows": "Parameters from operator initialization flow into hook methods (start_sync, start_profile_run, start_sync), which then execute remote API calls; flow is from input parameters → hook API calls → optional polling and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious strings; no obfuscated or unusual language features. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity detected. All parameters seem to be standard identifiers or configuration values.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom Airflow operators wrapping around hooks that interact with Rudderstack APIs. These operators initialize with configuration parameters, invoke API start methods (like start_sync, start_profile_run), and optionally poll for completion, with logging for progress. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels, are present. The use of parameters and hooks appears to be straightforward and aligned with typical API interaction patterns. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious language constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of custom Airflow operators for managing Rudderstack processes. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads.",
