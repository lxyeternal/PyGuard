  "purpose": "Define an Airflow DAG that executes a Rudderstack ETL task on a daily schedule.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables or Airflow variables via the template field '{{ var.value.etl_source_id }}'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or outputs are present in the code; the focus is on configuring an ETL operator.",
  "flows": "The template variable '{{ var.value.etl_source_id }}' flows into the 'etl_source_id' parameter of the RudderstackETLOperator.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of Airflow templating with '{{ var.value.etl_source_id }}' indicates dynamic data input; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious or unusual code structures or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard Airflow DAG with appropriate default args, scheduling, and a single operator using a template variable for 'etl_source_id'. The template variable suggests reliance on Airflow variables, which is common practice. The code does not include any hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, file access, or obfuscated logic is observed. The operator depends on external configurations provided via Airflow variables, which are expected to be secured and managed appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate Airflow DAG setup for executing a Rudderstack ETL process. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. It uses standard practices and no suspicious anomalies. The security risk is minimal, assuming proper management of Airflow variables.",
