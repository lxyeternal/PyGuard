  "purpose": "Define an Airflow DAG that executes a Rudderstack ETL process using a templated 'etl_source_id' variable.",
  "sources": "Airflow variable '{{ var.value.etl_source_id }}' used as input for the operator.",
  "sinks": "The operator interacts with an external API (Rudderstack), but no untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Template variable '{{ var.value.etl_source_id }}' flows from the DAG definition into the operator's parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholders for 'task_id' and 'connection_id' indicates template code; no actual anomalies or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Airflow DAG with a single operator that uses a standard templated variable for configuration. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The use of '{{ var.value.etl_source_id }}' is typical in Airflow workflows, though it relies on external variable management. The placeholders suggest incomplete deployment code but do not introduce security issues. No suspicious network activity or code injection is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Airflow DAG configuration for a Rudderstack ETL task. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The minimal security risk stems from reliance on external variables, which is common practice. Proper management of Airflow variables is recommended but outside the code's scope.",
