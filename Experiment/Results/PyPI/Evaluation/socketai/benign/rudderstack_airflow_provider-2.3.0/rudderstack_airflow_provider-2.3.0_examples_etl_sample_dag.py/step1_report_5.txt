  "purpose": "Define an Airflow DAG that schedules a Rudderstack ETL task to run daily.",
  "sources": "Input source is the template variable '{{ var.value.etl_source_id }}' used in the RudderstackETLOperator configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs; configuration parameters are static or templated.",
  "flows": "Template variable '{{ var.value.etl_source_id }}' flows from the source (Airflow variable) into the operator's parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Use of template variable for 'etl_source_id' could lead to injection if not properly validated; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present. The task_id and connection_id are placeholders, not hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Airflow DAG with standard configuration, scheduling, and a single operator that uses a template variable for 'etl_source_id'. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The only potential concern is the use of templating variable '{{ var.value.etl_source_id }}', which if not securely managed, could be exploited for injection or misconfiguration. The placeholders for 'task_id' and 'connection_id' are not hardcoded secrets but need proper assignment during deployment. Overall, the code appears straightforward and intended for legitimate ETL orchestration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Airflow DAG setup with a Rudderstack operator. No malicious intent or malicious code is detected. The only minor concern involves the use of a templated variable which should be validated externally to prevent injection. Overall, it appears safe.",
