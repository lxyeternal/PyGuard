{
  "purpose": "Define an Airflow DAG to run Rudderstack profile operations on a daily schedule.",
  "sources": "Template variable '{{ var.value.profile_id }}' used in the operator for profile_id; imported modules and default_args for DAG configuration.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data leaks or untrusted outputs directly in the code.",
  "flows": "The profile_id from the template variable flows into the RudderstackProfilesOperator, which executes within the DAG context.",
  "anomalies": "Use of template variable '{{ var.value.profile_id }}' suggests reliance on external configuration; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up an Airflow DAG with standard configuration, importing necessary modules. It uses a template variable for profile_id, which is a common pattern in Airflow for dynamic parameterization. The operator invoked is from a third-party provider but is used in a typical manner. No evidence of malicious code, such as network calls to suspicious domains, credential leaks, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Airflow DAG setup for Rudderstack profiles. It uses external configuration for profile_id and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code segments. Overall, it shows no signs of malware or security risks.",
