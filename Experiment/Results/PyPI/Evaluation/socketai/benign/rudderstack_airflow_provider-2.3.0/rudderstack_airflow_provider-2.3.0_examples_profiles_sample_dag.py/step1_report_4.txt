  "purpose": "Define an Airflow DAG to run a RudderstackProfilesOperator task for processing profiles on a daily schedule.",
  "sources": "Variable template '{{ var.value.profile_id }}' used for profile_id; environment or configuration for connection_id.",
  "sinks": "The profile_id value could be injected from untrusted sources if not properly secured; connection_id and task_id are placeholders.",
  "flows": "The template variable '{{ var.value.profile_id }}' flows into the profile_id parameter of the operator, potentially from external variable store.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Airflow variable templating without validation; placeholders for task_id and connection_id which could be misconfigured or malicious if externally controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an Airflow DAG with a single task using a custom operator. It relies on Airflow variables for profile_id, which can be externally set and may introduce risks if manipulated. No hardcoded secrets are present. The code does not perform any unsafe operations such as network calls, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The placeholders for task_id and connection_id are typical and not suspicious but should be properly secured. The code appears standard for an Airflow pipeline and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Airflow DAG setup for a Rudderstack operator with no evident malicious intent. The main concern is the use of external variables which should be secured properly. Overall, it appears safe with no malware indications.",
