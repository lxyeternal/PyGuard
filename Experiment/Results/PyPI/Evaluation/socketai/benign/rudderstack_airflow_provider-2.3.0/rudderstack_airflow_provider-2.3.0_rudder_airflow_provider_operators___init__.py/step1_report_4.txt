{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no immediately obvious malicious intent; it likely performs a utility or data processing function.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments, environment variables, or file I/O operations.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, writes to files, or sends data over network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as inputs or environment variables through processing functions and potentially reaches sinks like network sockets or files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code observed. Some use of dynamic features (e.g., eval, exec) if present could be suspicious, but none are apparent here.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, including the beginning, middle, and end. It contains standard library imports and typical programming constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors such as unauthorized network communications, data exfiltration, or system modifications were identified. No obfuscation, malware-like code, or suspicious dynamic execution patterns are present. The code seems consistent with typical open-source utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, functional Python script with no indicators of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
