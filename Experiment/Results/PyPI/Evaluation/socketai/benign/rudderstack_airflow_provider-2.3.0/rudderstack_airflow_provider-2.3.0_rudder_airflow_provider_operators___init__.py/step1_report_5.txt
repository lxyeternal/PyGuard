  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions within a larger Python project, with no explicit malicious intent apparent.",
  "sources": "Input is read from standard input, environment variables, or external libraries; no direct user input handling or file reading is evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections via imported libraries, file operations, or system commands, but none are explicitly used in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; data seems to be processed internally without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs identified. The code structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, uses standard library functions, and does not perform any unusual or suspicious operations. No external data exfiltration, network connections, or system manipulations are observed. The absence of malicious code or suspicious behaviors indicates a benign utility or processing script.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not show signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It appears to be standard, safe Python code with no security risks identified.",
