  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly clear from the snippet provided; it appears to be setting up some configurations or importing modules without performing any apparent operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and potentially from environment variables or input functions if present (not visible in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or data exfiltration points if the code interacts with external systems or writes sensitive data, but none are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows visible in the provided code fragment; the code primarily consists of imports and initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments are detected in the provided snippet. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of import statements and possibly configuration setups. There are no visible inputs, outputs, or operations that could be exploited. Without additional context, no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and standard in structure. More context or full code may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment.",
