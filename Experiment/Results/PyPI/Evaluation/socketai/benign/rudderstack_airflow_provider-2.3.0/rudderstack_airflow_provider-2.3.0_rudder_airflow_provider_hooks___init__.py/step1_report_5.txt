  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, with no explicit malicious intent identified.",
  "sources": "Input data could be read from function parameters, environment variables, or external files if present; however, no explicit sources are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be system commands, network connections, or data output functions; no such operations are clearly present in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources to sinks is not observable due to the lack of explicit input or output operations within the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code appears straightforward without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and does not include any external data inputs, network operations, or system modifications. There are no signs of code injection, insecure handling, or malicious behavior. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The overall structure indicates normal utility code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious elements detected. Confidence in this assessment is high given the straightforward nature of the snippet.",
