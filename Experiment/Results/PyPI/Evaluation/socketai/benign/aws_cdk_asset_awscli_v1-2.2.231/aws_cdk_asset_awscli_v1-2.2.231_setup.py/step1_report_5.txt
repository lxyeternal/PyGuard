  "purpose": "The script configures package metadata and setup parameters for a Python library related to AWS CDK assets.",
  "sources": "json.loads() parsing a JSON string, open() reading README.md, and setuptools.setup() processing the metadata.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() uses the provided metadata; open() reads from a local file.",
  "flows": "json.loads() loads package configuration data; open() reads README.md content into 'long_description'; setuptools.setup() processes all the package info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no external data fetching, and no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads package metadata from a hardcoded JSON string, reads a local README.md file for detailed description, and calls setuptools.setup() with the metadata. All operations are standard for package setup scripts. No external data is fetched dynamically, and there are no indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious activities or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script for packaging. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The operations are standard, and no anomalies or malicious signals are detected.",
