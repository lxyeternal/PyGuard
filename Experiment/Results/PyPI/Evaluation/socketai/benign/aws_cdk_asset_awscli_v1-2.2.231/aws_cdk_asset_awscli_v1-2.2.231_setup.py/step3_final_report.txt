  "purpose": "Package setup configuration loading metadata from a static JSON string and reading README.md for description.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded JSON string, local README.md file",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function call with package metadata",
  "flows": "JSON data is parsed into kwargs, then passed directly to setup() after reading README.md",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static data, no dynamic code, no external network activity, no secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that loads metadata from a hardcoded JSON string, reads a local README.md file for the long description, and invokes setuptools.setup() with these parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The JSON is static and contains only package info, and the file reading is typical. No external dependencies or network activity are involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign analysis. The code is straightforward, safe, and aligns with best practices for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk approximately 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
