  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "json.loads() parsing of package metadata, reading 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() invocation, potentially executing the package setup process.",
  "flows": "json.loads() -> reading 'README.md' -> setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No suspicious URL or script execution. The code mainly reads a JSON string and a README file, then calls a standard setup function.",
  "analysis": "The code loads package metadata from a JSON string, reads a README.md file to include as long_description, then invokes setuptools.setup() with these parameters. All operations are standard for package setup scripts. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. URLs and author information appear legitimate and related to AWS.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected tasks without anomalies.",
