{
  "purpose": "Setup and configuration of a Python package with dynamic assembly loading and publication, typical for AWS CDK/JSII modules.",
  "sources": "Module path extension (__path__), version retrieval via importlib.metadata, dynamic assembly load (jsii.JSIIAssembly.load), publication call (publication.publish).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; assembly load and publish are standard operations with controlled inputs.",
  "flows": "Static code paths for module setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard library and known package functions used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: extending module path, importing modules, retrieving version info, conditionally checking types, loading a JSII assembly, and publishing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The dynamic assembly loading and publication are typical in AWS CDK/JSII contexts and do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with benign package initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for an AWS CDK/JSII package. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present, and the security risk is minimal. The scores are justified and align with the code's behavior.",
