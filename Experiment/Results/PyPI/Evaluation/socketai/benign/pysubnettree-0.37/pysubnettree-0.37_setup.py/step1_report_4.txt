  "purpose": "Set up configuration for building the PySubnetTree Python package with C extensions.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'CFLAGS'; reading 'README' file.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data output or sensitive data leaks.",
  "flows": "Environment variable modification does not involve untrusted data; no data flow leading to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Modifies environment variable 'CFLAGS' to include compiler flag '-fno-strict-aliasing' — standard build customization, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup tasks, including reading a README file for long description and configuring C extension compilation. It sets an environment variable to influence compilation behavior, which is typical in build scripts. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The included files and dependencies are standard for a C extension build. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with C extensions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as intended for package configuration.",
