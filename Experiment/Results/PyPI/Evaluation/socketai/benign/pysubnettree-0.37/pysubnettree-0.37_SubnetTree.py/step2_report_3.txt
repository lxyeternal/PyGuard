  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, logical flaws, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SWIG-generated Python bindings for a C++ subnet tree class. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and auto-generated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, given the benign nature.\n- **Comments:** The report correctly identifies the code as auto-generated interface code with no malicious intent. The confidence is high (0.9). No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, describing a SWIG wrapper for subnet management. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward auto-generated code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly notes the lack of suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The confidence is perfect (1.0). No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical SWIG wrapper for a subnet tree library, with no malicious features.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** The report emphasizes the absence of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious patterns. The confidence is high (1.0). No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—auto-generated SWIG interface code for a subnet tree data structure, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** The analysis confirms the benign nature, standard patterns, and lack of malicious features. Confidence is high (1.0). No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports—auto-generated wrapper code, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** Correctly notes the absence of malicious features, no external communication, and standard patterns. Confidence is 0.9, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is auto-generated SWIG bindings with no malicious or suspicious content.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis. No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, auto-generated nature.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0.1 or 0, reflecting minimal security concern—appropriate given the benign analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious code or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward, auto-generated, and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk:** **0** or very close to it — the code is purely interface code, with no external data handling, network activity, or suspicious logic.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, benign SWIG interface for a C++ subnet tree library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
