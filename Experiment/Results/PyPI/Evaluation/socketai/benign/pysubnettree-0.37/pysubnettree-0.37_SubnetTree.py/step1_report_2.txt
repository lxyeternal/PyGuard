{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python wrapper generated by SWIG for interfacing with a C/C++ library related to subnet management, providing classes and functions for subnet operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'sys' module, particularly 'version_info', and dynamically imports the '_SubnetTree' C/C++ extension module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit untrusted data; it primarily creates class instances and calls methods from the imported module. No data leaks or malicious data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing system info, conditionally importing a compiled extension module, and defining Python classes that interface with the C/C++ backend. No external data flows or untrusted input processing are visible.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated by SWIG, contains standard dynamic imports based on Python version, and defines classes with properties and methods that wrap underlying C functions. No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical SWIG-generated wrapper facilitating Python interaction with a native library. It performs conditional importing of the extension module depending on the Python version and defines classes for managing subnet data. The functions mostly delegate to underlying C/C++ implementations. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not handle untrusted input or perform any network operations. Its structure and content are consistent with standard auto-generated interface code, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is an auto-generated, benign interface wrapper for a native subnet management library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security vulnerabilities based on the provided content.",
