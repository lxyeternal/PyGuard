{
  "purpose": "This code is a SWIG-generated Python wrapper for a C++ library related to subnet tree data structures, primarily for network address management.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard modules (sys, importlib, imp, os.path, __builtin__), dynamic import of '_SubnetTree' module, and class methods that interface with the '_SubnetTree' C++ extension.",
  "sinks": "Methods that invoke functions from the '_SubnetTree' extension, which may process network address data; no external network or file I/O operations are explicitly present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from Python class methods to the underlying '_SubnetTree' C++ extension, passing subnet data and mode settings, with no evidence of untrusted input handling or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated by SWIG, contains standard wrapper patterns, and does not include any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports a C++ extension '_SubnetTree' using different methods based on Python version. It defines classes that act as proxies to native C++ objects, enabling insertion, removal, lookup, and iteration over subnet data. All interactions are through the extension, with no input validation or network activity. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; the code appears to be a standard SWIG wrapper for a subnet management library. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard auto-generated wrapper code for a native C++ subnet tree library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as an interface to a network address management library, with no suspicious or malicious activities embedded.",
