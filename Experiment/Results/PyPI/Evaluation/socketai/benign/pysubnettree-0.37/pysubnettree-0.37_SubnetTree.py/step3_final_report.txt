{
  "purpose": "This code provides Python bindings for a C++ subnet tree library generated via SWIG, enabling Python code to interact with native C++ functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for native module '_SubnetTree', dynamic import helpers, class constructors calling '_SubnetTree.new_*' functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network operations, no data exfiltration, no hardcoded credentials, no external communication.",
  "flows": "Initialization of Python classes calls native functions to create C++ objects; attribute access delegates to native getters/setters; method calls invoke native functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow detected. The code is auto-generated and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SWIG-generated interface for a C++ subnet tree. It performs dynamic imports based on Python version, defines classes that wrap native pointers, and delegates method calls to native functions. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The import logic and class structures are typical for SWIG bindings. The security implications are minimal, as the code only interfaces with native code without performing network or file operations. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero, and the overall security risk is very low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated SWIG interface for a C++ subnet tree library. It contains no malicious features, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
