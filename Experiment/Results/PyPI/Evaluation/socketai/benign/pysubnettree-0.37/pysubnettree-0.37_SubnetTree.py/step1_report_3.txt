{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python wrapper generated by SWIG for a C/C++ module related to subnet tree data structures, used for network address management.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as 'importlib', 'imp', and system modules; loads a native extension '_SubnetTree'. No user input or external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "Calls to underlying '_SubnetTree' functions that manipulate subnet data structures; no direct data leakage or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization and method calls on 'SubnetTree' and 'inx_addr' classes invoke native extension functions; no evidence of data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely auto-generated SWIG wrapper code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. The code does not perform network operations, file operations, or execute arbitrary code beyond calling native extension functions.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles dynamic module import based on Python version, sets up class interfaces for native C/C++ code, and defines standard wrapper functions for attribute access, object lifecycle, and class methods. It is typical auto-generated SWIG interface code. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The code strictly wraps and exposes native functions, with no external or untrusted data handling. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SWIG-generated wrapper for a native subnet tree library. It performs no malicious actions, does not handle untrusted data in a suspicious way, and lacks any malicious code features. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
