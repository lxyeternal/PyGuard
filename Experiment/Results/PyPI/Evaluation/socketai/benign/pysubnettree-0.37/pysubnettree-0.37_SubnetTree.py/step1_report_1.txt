{
  "purpose": "This code provides Python bindings for the SWIG-generated C++ class '_SubnetTree' and related data structures, enabling Python interaction with subnet tree data structures.",
  "sources": "Imports of '_SubnetTree' module via dynamic import methods, reading of Python version info, and initialization of class attributes and properties.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to '_SubnetTree' functions such as 'new_SubnetTree', 'delete_SubnetTree', and other class methods like 'insert', 'remove', 'lookup', which invoke underlying C++ code.",
  "flows": "Initialization of Python objects (inx_addr, SubnetTree) triggers calls to C++ functions via SWIG interface, with attribute access routing through getter/setter functions, and method calls propagating to '_SubnetTree' implementations.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes dynamic import helpers, conditional imports based on Python version, and property/method mappings for C++ functions. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard SWIG-generated Python binding for a C++ subnet tree data structure. It handles dynamic module imports, defines Python classes that interface with underlying C++ implementations, and manages attribute access through generated getter/setter functions. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be purely interface code, with no network communication, data leaks, or harmful actions embedded.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard auto-generated SWIG interface for a C++ subnet tree library. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The code serves as a bridge between Python and C++, with no evident security risks or malicious intent.",
