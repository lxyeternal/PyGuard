  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content**: All reports describe the same code snippet:\n```python\n__version__ = '1.1.22'\n```\nThis is a standard version string assignment, commonly used in Python packages to specify version information.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n- **Code Analysis**: Every report confirms that the code is minimal, straightforward, and only assigns a string to a variable. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n- **Malicious Behavior**: No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- **Errors or Flaws**: No errors, flaws, or mistakes are identified in the logic or reasoning of the reports.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities**: The reports correctly dismiss any vulnerabilities, as the code is purely metadata.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification**:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n  \n  These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores**:\n- Since the code is just a version string assignment, the risk score should be 0, reflecting no security concern.\n- Malware score is correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score is correctly 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as standard practice for versioning.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score**: **0**  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n**Estimated Risk Score**: **0**\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- The code is a straightforward version string assignment with no external data, no inputs/outputs, and no suspicious constructs.\n- There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is safe, and the current scoring accurately represents its security posture.",
