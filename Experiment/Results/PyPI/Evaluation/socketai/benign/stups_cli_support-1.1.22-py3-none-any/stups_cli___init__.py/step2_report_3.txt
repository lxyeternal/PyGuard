  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string (`'1.1.22'`) to the variable `__version__`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external communications, or complex logic.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and commonly used in Python packages for version tracking.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - All reports explicitly state there are no anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The conclusions are justified given the code's simplicity and standard practice.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforwardness.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the absence of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, justified by the lack of any malicious or vulnerable code.\n\n5. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities, focusing solely on the code's observable behavior.\n   - There are no claims about vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard version string assignment, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature, I agree with the reports' conclusions and scores. No further action or concern is warranted for this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate, and the analysis aligns with the code's function.",
