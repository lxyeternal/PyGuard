  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable for package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It involves no inputs, outputs, external communications, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving solely as package metadata. All reports accurately assess this, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
