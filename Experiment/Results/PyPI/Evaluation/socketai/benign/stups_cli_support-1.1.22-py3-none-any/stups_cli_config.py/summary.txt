  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration utility with minimal security risks. The only potential vulnerability lies in parsing untrusted DNS TXT data with yaml.safe_load, which could be exploited if DNS responses are maliciously crafted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The scores are appropriate, with a slight adjustment of the risk score for the DNS parsing concern."
