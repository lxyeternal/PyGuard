  "purpose": "To invoke configuration setup from the stups_cli library when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "Import statement for stups_cli.config; execution of stups_cli.config.configure() within main guard.",
  "sinks": "stups_cli.config.configure() likely performs configuration tasks; potential sink if it handles sensitive data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Import stups_cli.config -> call to stups_cli.config.configure() when __name__ == '__main__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and function call within main guard. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named stups_cli.config and calls its configure() function if the script is executed as the main program. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code is minimal, clear, and follows standard Python idioms. The only potential concern would be what stups_cli.config.configure() does internally, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple script that triggers configuration setup via an external library. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident from the code provided.",
