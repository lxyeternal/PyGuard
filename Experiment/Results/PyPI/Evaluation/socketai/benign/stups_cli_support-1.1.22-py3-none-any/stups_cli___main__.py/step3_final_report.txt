  "purpose": "Invoke configuration setup from the stups_cli library during script execution.",
  "sources": "Import of stups_cli.config module; call to stups_cli.config.configure() within main guard.",
  "sinks": "The configure() function acts as the main sink; potential data or behavior effects depend on its internal implementation.",
  "flows": "Import of module (source) leads to calling configure() (sink) when script runs as main.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a module and calls a function if run directly. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are visible. The security implications hinge on what configure() does internally, which is unknown. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this pattern. Malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscated score is zero; risk score is very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern based on this code alone. Confidence in benign assessment is high, given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the internal implementation of configure(). The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
