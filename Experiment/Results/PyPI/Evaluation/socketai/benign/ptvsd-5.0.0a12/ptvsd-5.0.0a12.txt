The only minor security consideration is the trust in the external build script invoked via subprocess, which is common in build environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to subprocess execution of external scripts. No modifications to the scores are necessary."

However, its capability to enable remote debugging based on external inputs introduces a notable security risk if exposed or manipulated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a recommended risk score around 0.7 to reflect the potential for exploitation. Proper safeguards, such as disabling debugging in production and validating inputs, are essential."
