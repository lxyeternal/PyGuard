  "conclusion": "The code is intended for debugging and is not malicious. However, its capability to enable remote debugging based on external inputs introduces a notable security risk if exposed or manipulated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a recommended risk score around 0.7 to reflect the potential for exploitation. Proper safeguards, such as disabling debugging in production and validating inputs, are essential."
