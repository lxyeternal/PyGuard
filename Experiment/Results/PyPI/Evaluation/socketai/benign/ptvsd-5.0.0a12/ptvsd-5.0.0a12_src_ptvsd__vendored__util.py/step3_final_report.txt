  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward; potential misuse of user-defined filters noted but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe, standard filesystem traversal utilities with filtering capabilities. It uses common Python functions without obfuscation or malicious patterns. No external network activity or data exfiltration is present. The filtering functions are user-defined callbacks, which could be misused if malicious filters are supplied, but this is an expected pattern. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assign a malware score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1). The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features support these conclusions. No logical errors or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for directory traversal with filtering. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low risk score appropriately reflects potential misuse of filters, but overall, the code is benign.",
