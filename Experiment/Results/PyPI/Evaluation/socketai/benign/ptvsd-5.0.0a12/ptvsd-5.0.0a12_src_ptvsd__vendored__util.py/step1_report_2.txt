  "purpose": "Utility functions for directory traversal and context management, allowing iteration over files and directories with filtering capabilities.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.getcwd(), os.path.isdir(), os.path.join()",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or system effects; code primarily reads filesystem information.",
  "flows": "The code reads directory and file information and yields it; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs standard filesystem operations and filtering.",
  "analysis": "The code provides context management for changing directories and functions to iterate over files and directories with optional filtering via 'prune_dir' and 'exclude_file' callbacks. It uses standard library functions for filesystem traversal without executing or processing untrusted input beyond filesystem reads. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present. No external network or system modification actions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for filesystem traversal with filtering, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It does not process or transmit untrusted data outside the filesystem context.",
