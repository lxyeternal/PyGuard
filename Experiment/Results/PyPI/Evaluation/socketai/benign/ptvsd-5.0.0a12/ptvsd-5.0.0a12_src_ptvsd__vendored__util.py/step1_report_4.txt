  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for directory navigation and file iteration with filtering options.",
  "sources": "Reads the current working directory (os.getcwd()), lists directory contents (os.listdir()), and reads environment variables (not explicitly used here but potentially relevant if expanded).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; functions mainly yield directory and file paths.",
  "flows": "From reading directory contents to yielding file and directory paths. No untrusted data flows to external systems or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code structure is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines context managers and iterators for directory traversal with optional filtering, using standard library functions. It does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or any other malicious actions. The code is well-structured, with clear intent to list and filter filesystem entries. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present. The only minor note is the comment suggesting a more restrictive file check, but it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs safe directory traversal and filtering operations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is utility code for filesystem navigation, typical in many applications.",
