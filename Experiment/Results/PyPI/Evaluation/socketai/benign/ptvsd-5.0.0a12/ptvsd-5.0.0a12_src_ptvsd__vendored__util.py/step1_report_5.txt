{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for directory navigation and file iteration, including context management for changing directories and recursive file listing with filtering.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.getcwd(), os.path.join(), os.path.isdir()",
  "sinks": "None observed that directly accept untrusted data; functions are standard filesystem operations with no data transmission or external communication.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks leading to malicious effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code primarily handles filesystem traversal with filtering options.",
  "analysis": "The code defines context managers and iteration functions to traverse directory trees. It uses standard library calls for directory and file checks, with provisions for pruning directories and excluding files via callback functions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious logic. The functions are typical for filesystem management and do not process untrusted input in a manner that could lead to security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs directory traversal and filtering functions in a standard manner without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not contain backdoors, malware, or security risks. Overall, it appears safe.",
