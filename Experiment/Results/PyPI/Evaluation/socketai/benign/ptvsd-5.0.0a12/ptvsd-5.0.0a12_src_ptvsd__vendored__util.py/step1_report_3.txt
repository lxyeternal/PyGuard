  "purpose": "Utility functions for directory navigation and file iteration with filtering capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reading directory contents via os.listdir() and os.getcwd(); input from filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily reads filesystem data.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data read sources flow into generators that yield directory and file information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code; no code injection or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides context management for changing directories and functions for iterating over filesystem contents with optional filtering via prune_dir and exclude_file. It reads data from the filesystem but does not process or transmit untrusted data externally. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior identified. It follows standard patterns for filesystem traversal with filtering.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for directory and file traversal with filtering options. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks detected based on the provided code.",
