  "purpose": "Utility functions for directory traversal and file iteration with filtering capabilities.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.path.join(), os.getcwd() (reading directory structure and current working directory).",
  "sinks": "os.chdir(), os.listdir(), yielding filenames, potentially used for further file processing.",
  "flows": "Input data from directory listings flow into iteration logic, potentially influencing file processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscation or malicious intent evident. Functions perform standard directory operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides context managers and iterators for directory traversal with filtering options. It reads directory contents via os.listdir(), constructs paths with os.path.join(), and manages current directory state with os.getcwd() and os.chdir(). No untrusted input is explicitly fetched from external sources, nor are there any network operations or data leaks. The filtering functions (prune_dir, exclude_file) are placeholders for user-defined filters, which could potentially be misused if malicious filters are provided externally, but this is an expected pattern for customization. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard directory traversal utility with filtering, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe filesystem operations without external data transmission or suspicious behavior.",
