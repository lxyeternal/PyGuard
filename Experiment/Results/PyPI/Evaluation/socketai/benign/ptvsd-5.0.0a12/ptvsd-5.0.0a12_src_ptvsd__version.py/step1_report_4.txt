{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate version information for a package, likely used for tracking or display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the variable 'version_json' which contains JSON-formatted version info.",
  "sinks": "The code uses json.loads to parse the JSON data, which is a safe and standard operation.",
  "flows": "The function get_versions() retrieves the static JSON string and parses it into a Python object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic data input or output involved.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version information from a hardcoded JSON string generated by a versioning tool. It performs a simple parse operation and returns the resulting object. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no network operations, and no malicious code or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward, clean, and typical for version tracking scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely for retrieving static version info. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
