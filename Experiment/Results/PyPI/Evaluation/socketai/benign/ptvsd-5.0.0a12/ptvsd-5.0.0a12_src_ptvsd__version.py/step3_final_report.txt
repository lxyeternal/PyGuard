{
  "purpose": "Provides version metadata information by parsing a static JSON string generated by 'versioneer.py'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a hardcoded JSON string assigned to 'version_json'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "The function 'get_versions()' loads and returns the static JSON data; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. It is a static data provider.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static JSON string containing version info, then provides a function to parse and return this data. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved. The JSON data is generated by a versioning tool and is static. The code structure is simple, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. The malware score is 0, as there are no malicious behaviors. The security risk score is 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or data leaks. The confidence score is 1, as the analysis is based on the static, straightforward nature of the code. Overall, the code is benign, serving as a version info provider, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version information provider generated by 'versioneer.py'. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
