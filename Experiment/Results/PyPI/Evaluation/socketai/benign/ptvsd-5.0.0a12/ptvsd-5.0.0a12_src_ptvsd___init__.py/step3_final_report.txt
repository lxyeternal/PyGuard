{
  "purpose": "Provides debugging control functions for Python using the ptvsd library, enabling attach, wait, break, tracing, and related debugging features.",
  "sources": "Function calls to 'api' methods imported dynamically from 'ptvsd.server.api' within each function.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'api' functions that control debugger state; no external data sources or network communication.",
  "flows": "Function invocation → dynamic import of 'api' → call to specific 'api' method controlling debugger behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected; dynamic import is standard for lazy loading.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around the 'ptvsd' debugging library, exposing functions to manage debugging sessions. It uses dynamic import within functions to defer loading, which is a common pattern. No external untrusted data is processed, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The purpose is solely to facilitate debugging, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context, as debugging capabilities could be misused if environment is compromised, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious debugging utility wrapper for 'ptvsd'. It contains no malware or obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal. The current assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
