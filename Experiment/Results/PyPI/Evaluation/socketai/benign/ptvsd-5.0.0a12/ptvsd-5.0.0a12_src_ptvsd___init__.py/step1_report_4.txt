  "purpose": "Implementing a Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) for Python, providing functions for attaching, debugging, and controlling debugger behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports from ptvsd (e.g., ptvsd.server.api, ptvsd._version), data from __version__, and os.path for __file__.",
  "sinks": "Calls to api functions (e.g., wait_for_attach, enable_attach, attach, is_attached, break_into_debugger, debug_this_thread, tracing), which control debugging behavior.",
  "flows": "User or environment triggers functions like enable_attach or attach, which communicate with ptvsd.server.api to control debugger state; data flows from function calls to API invocations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The import of ptvsd, a known debugging library, is expected. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. Usage of codecs preloading appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard implementation of debugging functions interfacing with the ptvsd debugging library, which is used for attaching debuggers and controlling debugging sessions. It carefully defers importing the core API until necessary, minimizing loading of potentially complex modules. No suspicious code, such as network connections to unknown hosts, data exfiltration, or code injection, is present. All functions are straightforward wrappers around the ptvsd API, with clear documentation. The purpose is to facilitate debugging, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate debugging utility, not malicious. It provides controlled debugging capabilities via the ptvsd library, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or malicious behavior.",
