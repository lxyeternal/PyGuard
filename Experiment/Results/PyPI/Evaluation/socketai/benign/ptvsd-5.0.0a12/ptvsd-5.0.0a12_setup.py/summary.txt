  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script for the ptvsd package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is the trust in the external build script invoked via subprocess, which is common in build environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to subprocess execution of external scripts. No modifications to the scores are necessary."
