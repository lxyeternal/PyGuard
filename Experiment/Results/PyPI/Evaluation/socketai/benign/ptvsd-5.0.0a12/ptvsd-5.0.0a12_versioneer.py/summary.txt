  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source version management tool used in Python projects. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The subprocess executions and file modifications are standard for build automation. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, with a low risk score (~0.2) justified by its operations in trusted environments."
