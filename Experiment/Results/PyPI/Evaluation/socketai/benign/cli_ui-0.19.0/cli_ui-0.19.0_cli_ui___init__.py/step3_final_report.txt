{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive CLI utility library providing styled messaging, user prompts, timing, and debugging functions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., VERBOSE), user input via input() and getpass.getpass(), environment variables, sys modules.",
  "sinks": "Terminal output (stdout/stderr), traceback information for debugging, environment variables.",
  "flows": "User input flows into prompt functions; messages are displayed via terminal output; traceback info is generated for exceptions; no external network or file system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard CLI utility functions for styling terminal output, prompting users, measuring execution time, and debugging. It uses common libraries like colorama and sys modules. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. Tracebacks are used for debugging purposes, which is typical. The functions handle user input securely and do not perform any unsafe operations. Overall, the code is well-structured, clear, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard CLI utility library with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk is consistent with typical CLI tools involving user input and environment variables.",
