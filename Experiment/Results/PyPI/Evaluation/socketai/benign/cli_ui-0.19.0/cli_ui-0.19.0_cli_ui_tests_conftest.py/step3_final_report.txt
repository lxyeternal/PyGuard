  "purpose": "Testing utility for recording, resetting, and searching messages within the cli_ui module's internal state.",
  "sources": "Internal variables cli_ui._MESSAGES and cli_ui.CONFIG",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks are present",
  "flows": "Manipulation of internal variables for message recording and retrieval",
  "anomalies": "Direct modification of internal module variables, which is unconventional but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code interacts solely with internal state of cli_ui, using standard Python modules (re, pytest). It provides message recording and searching functionalities for testing purposes. No external data, network activity, or malicious patterns are detected. The manipulation of internal variables is typical in testing scenarios and does not indicate malicious intent. Regex usage is standard, and no obfuscation or secrets are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, testing-focused nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign testing utility that manipulates internal variables for message handling. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security threat. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
