  "purpose": "This code provides a helper class and a fixture for testing message emission and recording within the 'cli_ui' module.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'cli_ui._MESSAGES' and 'cli_ui.CONFIG' for controlling message recording state.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no data leaks or malicious actions detected.",
  "flows": "Code sets and resets recording flags and manipulates the internal message list, with no flow leading to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a third-party testing library, then defines a helper class to manage message recording in 'cli_ui'. It manipulates internal variables for test purposes. No external data input, no sensitive data handling, and no network or file operations are present. The pattern matching uses standard regex with no dangerous execution. The fixture ensures proper setup and teardown for tests. Overall, the code appears to be purely for testing and internal state management with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing utility that manages message recording within a testing context. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code detected. It operates solely on internal variables for testing purposes.",
