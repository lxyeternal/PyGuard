  "purpose": "The code imports a class 'MessageRecorder' from a local module 'conftest', likely for testing or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'conftest'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no suspicious or unusual code detected. The use of 'conftest' suggests test configuration, which is typical and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing 'MessageRecorder' from a relative module 'conftest'. There are no data inputs, network calls, or data processing. 'conftest' is commonly used in pytest configurations and test setups, indicating this is likely part of a test suite. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign import statement used for testing purposes with no malicious intent or security risks.",
