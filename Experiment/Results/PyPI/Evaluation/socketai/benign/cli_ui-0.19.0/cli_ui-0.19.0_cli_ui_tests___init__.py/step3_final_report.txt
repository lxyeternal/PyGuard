  "purpose": "Import of MessageRecorder from conftest module, likely for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Local import statement from .conftest import MessageRecorder",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data sources present",
  "flows": "Import statement loads MessageRecorder into the namespace; no data flow beyond module import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import with linter suppression comment (# noqa) in test setup",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement used in test configurations, particularly with pytest. It does not involve network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The import is typical for fixture setup, and the use of # noqa indicates suppression of linter warnings, common in test code. All signals point to benign, intended use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test fixture import with no malicious intent or security concerns. The analysis and scores are consistent with this assessment.",
