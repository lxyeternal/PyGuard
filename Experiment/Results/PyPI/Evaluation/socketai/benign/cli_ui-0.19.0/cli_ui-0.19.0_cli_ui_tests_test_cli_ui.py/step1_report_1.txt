{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the cli_ui library, testing various UI functions such as info, error, prompts, and table display features.",
  "sources": "Input sources include built-in functions 'input' and 'getpass.getpass' (mocked during tests). Data reading occurs during user prompts and message recording.",
  "sinks": "Output sinks are 'fileobj' parameters (mocked StringIO objects), message recorder, and printed console output. No direct untrusted data sinks are present in code.",
  "flows": "Sources (user input, getpass) flow into functions like ask_string, ask_yes_no, ask_choice, select_choices. Outputs are printed to StringIO objects or message recorder.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual language features observed. Usage of mock for input/output is standard for tests.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for a CLI UI library, with functions designed for displaying colored messages, handling user input, and formatting tables. All data handling appears standard for testing purposes, with mocking used to simulate user interaction. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration methods are present. The only external interactions involve user prompts and message recording, typical for test scenarios. No suspicious network activity or system modifications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for a CLI utility library with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It primarily tests UI functions and user interactions in a controlled environment. Overall security risk is negligible.",
