{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the cli_ui library, verifying output formatting, input handling, and error messaging.",
  "sources": "Input functions: built-in input, getpass.getpass, mocked in tests; data sources in tests are hardcoded, and environment variables for os.name are used.",
  "sinks": "Console output via file-like objects (smart_tty, dumb_tty); exception messages; system exit calls in fatal().",
  "flows": "User input flows into ask_string, ask_yes_no, ask_choice, select_choices; output to console; exceptions captured and formatted with message_for_exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. Usage of standard libraries, no obfuscated code or unusual features observed. No external network, file, or system modification functions present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for CLI interactions, mainly testing formatting, user input, and error handling. It employs standard Python libraries and testing practices. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors are present. The code's structure and usage are consistent with testing a CLI utility. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate test code for a CLI utility library, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
