  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info and version details.\n- No suspicious behavior, external data fetching, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious activity is detected.\n- The code reads command-line arguments and writes static strings to stdout.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does exactly what the report describes—no hidden or malicious code, no data leaks, no backdoors. The code is straightforward.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are apparent. The logic is simple and correct for its purpose.\n- **Scores:** The malware and security risk scores are appropriately set at 0, given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code is purely informational, the risk score of 0.5 or higher is unjustified.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Score consistency:** All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a minimal, safe CLI utility.\n- No modifications or hidden behaviors are evident.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward CLI script providing static package info. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
