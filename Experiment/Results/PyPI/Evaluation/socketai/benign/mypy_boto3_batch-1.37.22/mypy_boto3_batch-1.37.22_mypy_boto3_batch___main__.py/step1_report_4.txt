{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entry point that outputs package information or version details based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data sources or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) leads to calling print_version or print_info, which write fixed strings to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution observed. The data output appears static and informational.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for command-line interaction and output. It defines functions to print package info and version. The main function checks for '--version' argument to decide which info to display. No external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code simply outputs static strings based on a command-line argument. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool that outputs package metadata and version info. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no external data flows, and no security issues. It appears safe and intended solely for informational purposes.",
