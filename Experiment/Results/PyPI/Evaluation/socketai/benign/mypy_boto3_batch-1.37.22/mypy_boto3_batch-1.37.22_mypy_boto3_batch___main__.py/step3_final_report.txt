  "purpose": "Provide static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv), static string outputs to stdout.",
  "sinks": "stdout writes, no external data or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "Argument check in main() -> print_version() or print_info() -> stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments. It reads command-line args and writes fixed strings to stdout. No dynamic data, external network activity, or code execution is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are detected. The logic is correct, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI script providing static package info. The analysis confirms no malicious activity or security risks. The scores are accurate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.",
