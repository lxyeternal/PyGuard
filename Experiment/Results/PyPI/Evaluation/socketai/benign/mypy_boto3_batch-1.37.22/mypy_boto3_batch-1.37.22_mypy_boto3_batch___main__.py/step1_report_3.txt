  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational outputs about boto3 type annotations and version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), and writes to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout based on input commands; no untrusted data sink with external system interaction.",
  "flows": "User input (sys.argv) triggers output functions that display static information; no data flow involving untrusted sources to sinks that cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Functions only output static, informational text. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple functions for printing package info and version, triggered based on command-line arguments. No user input is processed in a dangerous way. The script only outputs static, predefined strings. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign CLI utility designed for informational purposes only. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It simply prints static information based on user command-line input.",
