{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging the 'mypy-boto3-batch' Python library, primarily used to define package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; static package metadata defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic data handling or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> passes static data to setup() -> completes packaging process; no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which is not suspicious but noteworthy.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward, static setup configuration for a Python package. It imports standard modules, reads a local README file safely, and calls 'setup()' with fixed parameters. There are no dynamic behaviors, network activities, obfuscated code, or embedded secrets. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and static nature of the code. The future year (2025) does not impact security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the current scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
