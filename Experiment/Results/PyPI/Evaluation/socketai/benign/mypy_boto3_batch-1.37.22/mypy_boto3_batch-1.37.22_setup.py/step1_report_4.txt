  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-batch', used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines static package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The copyright year is 2025, which is future-dated but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or potentially malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
