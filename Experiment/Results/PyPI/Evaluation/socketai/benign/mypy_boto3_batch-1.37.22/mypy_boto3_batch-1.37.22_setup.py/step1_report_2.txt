  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project 'mypy-boto3-batch', providing metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setup from setuptools; defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external systems or handles untrusted input; no sinks identified that could cause data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The script loads a file (README.md) and passes static data to setup(). No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is a standard setup script with typical metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional Python setup script for packaging. It reads a markdown file for description, defines package info, dependencies, and URLs. No user input handling or dynamic execution present. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears clean and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script used for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified.",
