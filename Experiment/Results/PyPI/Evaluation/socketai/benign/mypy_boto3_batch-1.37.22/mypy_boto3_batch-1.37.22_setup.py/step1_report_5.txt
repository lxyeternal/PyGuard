{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the Python package 'mypy-boto3-batch' by providing metadata and configuration for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and uses hardcoded package metadata such as name, version, author, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the script mainly defines static configuration data for package setup.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; data is static configuration information used during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for a Python package, importing 'Path' and 'setuptools.setup', reading a README file for description, and calling setup() with package metadata. The only file I/O is reading the README.md, which is typical and safe. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
