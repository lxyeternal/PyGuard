  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for AWS Batch API client wrapper, facilitating type-safe interactions with AWS Batch services.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (kwargs) unpacked from request type definitions, used as inputs for API calls.",
  "sinks": "API request calls to AWS services; no data exfiltration or external sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into API request methods, with no suspicious data handling or external data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API client wrapper with comprehensive type annotations, overloads for paginators, and documentation links. It does not contain dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The use of kwargs aligns with standard SDK design, and no data leaks or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's nature, reflecting its role as a safe API interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-typed AWS Batch client wrapper with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
