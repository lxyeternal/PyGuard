  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`, with no external inputs, dynamic behavior, or obfuscation.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is standard for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, no reason to increase the risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is correct; the code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign version declaration.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.\n- The high confidence (1) in all reports is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
