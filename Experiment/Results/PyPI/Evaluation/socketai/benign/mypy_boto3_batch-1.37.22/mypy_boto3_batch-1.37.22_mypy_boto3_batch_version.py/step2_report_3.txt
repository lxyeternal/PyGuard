  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external communications, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code contains only a copyright comment and a static string assignment.\n\n2. **Potential for Malicious Behavior**:\n   - Given the code's simplicity, there is no evidence of malicious intent.\n   - No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The version string is hardcoded, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and typical for version declaration.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is justified.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n5. **Any Claims Based on Assumptions?**:\n   - No, all claims are based on the actual code content.\n   - The assumption that a version string assignment is benign is valid.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable assessments are evident.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: Should remain **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Should remain **0**.\n- **Risk Score**: Should remain **0**.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My personal estimate** aligns with the reports:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nNo further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
