  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data handling, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is a standard practice in Python packages for versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Malware**:\n   - No report detects any malicious code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and contains only a copyright comment and a version string.\n\n3. **Error or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code.\n   - The static assignment of a version string is common and not risky.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is benign.\n   - The risk scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n   - The confidence scores are rightly at 1, given the clarity and simplicity.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a straightforward version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, non-malicious version declaration. All reports are accurate, and no changes to the scores are necessary.",
