  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"1.37.22\"`) with a copyright notice. There are no inputs, no external data handling, no dynamic behavior, and no obfuscation. The code is standard in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign and typical for version declaration.  \n   - No report suggests any hidden malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk.  \n   - The analysis in each report is sound, with no logical flaws or assumptions that could be challenged.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, and scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all 0.  \n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.  \n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   - Since the code is purely a static version string assignment with no external inputs, no dynamic code, and no suspicious constructs, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.  \n   - The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward and human-readable.  \n   - The overall security risk is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's benign nature.  \n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed or implied.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's content.\n\n**Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risk present; this is a standard version declaration.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a typical, benign version string assignment in a Python package. All evidence points to it being harmless, with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nI agree with the existing scores. No adjustments are necessary. The code is perfectly safe and standard.",
