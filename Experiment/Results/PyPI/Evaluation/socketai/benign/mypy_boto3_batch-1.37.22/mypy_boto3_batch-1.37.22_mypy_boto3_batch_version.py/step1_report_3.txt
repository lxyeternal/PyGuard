  "purpose": "Define the version string for the package, serving as source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable with a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is simple, straightforward, and contains only a version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a copyright statement and a variable __version__ assigned with a static string '1.37.22'. There are no functions, external inputs, or dynamic behaviors. The code is typical for a version declaration file. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; it is a standard practice in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves solely to specify the package version and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It is a benign version declaration file.",
