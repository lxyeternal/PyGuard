  "purpose": "Declare the package version with a static string assignment.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; simple, straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, with no inputs, outputs, external data, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, standard practice for version declaration. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk features are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
