  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded version string is typical; no unusual code, secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a copyright comment, a version assignment, and a string with version info. No external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The version string appears static and unencrypted. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice for Python packages to define a version string this way.",
