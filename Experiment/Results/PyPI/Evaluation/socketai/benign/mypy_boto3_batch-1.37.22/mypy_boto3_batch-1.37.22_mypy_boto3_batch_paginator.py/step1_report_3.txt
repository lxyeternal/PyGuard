  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Batch service, providing structured and type-checked access to paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class method parameters via **kwargs",
  "sinks": "None explicitly involve untrusted data processing or external data sinks; the code mainly defines classes and type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; class methods accept kwargs for pagination, which are type-annotated and do not process untrusted input directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard for type annotations and paginator class definitions. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. Use of conditional import for 'Unpack' based on Python version is normal. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for AWS Batch with appropriate type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility. It employs standard practices for extending Paginator with specific response and request types. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The structure is clear, and all methods seem to follow expected patterns. No untrusted input handling or external communication is included within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type-annotated paginator class definitions for AWS Batch, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
