{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Batch service client to facilitate paginated API responses in Python with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class methods that accept **kwargs and return PageIterator objects.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept untrusted input via **kwargs, which are then passed to the underlying Paginator.paginate() method, returning an iterator over response data.",
  "flows": "Input through **kwargs flows into the Paginator.paginate() method, which outputs a PageIterator yielding response objects; no untrusted data directly impacts system state or sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code relies on standard AWS SDK patterns and static type annotations. No suspicious or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes extending base Paginator classes, each with a 'paginate' method that takes dynamic keyword arguments. These methods are wrappers around boto3's pagination, with type annotations for safety. The code includes conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions. No untrusted data sources, system calls, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK interface wrapper for type-safe paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless SDK wrapper providing type annotations for AWS Batch paginators. No malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or security risks are evident. The code's design is consistent with normal type-safe SDK usage, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
