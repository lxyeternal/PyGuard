{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations and paginator classes for boto3 batch service, enabling type safety and structured iteration over AWS Batch resources.",
  "sources": "Static imports, method parameters accepting kwargs, no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Method calls with kwargs, no data leaks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into boto3 paginator methods; no external data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for paginators with type annotations, using standard patterns like Unpack for flexible argument passing. It is well-structured, documented, and aligns with auto-generated SDK stub practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of kwargs with Unpack is typical but could be misused if external code supplies malicious data; however, this is inherent to boto3's design and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard implementation of boto3 paginator type annotations, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The slight elevation in risk score (0.1) in some reports appropriately reflects the flexible kwargs pattern but does not imply actual danger.",
