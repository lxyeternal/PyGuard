  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, structure, and purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely static type annotations and data structures for AWS Batch, with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- **Findings:** No external data sources, no executable code, no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is a standard type stub module, with no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature of the code, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No external data processing, no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that the code is purely type definitions, typical for SDK schemas.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code's purpose for type safety, with no runtime or external data handling.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or dynamic code.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's static, schema-like structure.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the static nature and absence of dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No external input processing, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code is purely type annotations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that the code consists solely of type definitions and imports, with no runtime logic.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is static and schema-focused.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static type annotations and data schemas for AWS Batch.\n- No external data processing, no dynamic code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The conditional imports are standard for compatibility and do not introduce any security issues.\n- The purpose is for type safety, documentation, and validation, not execution.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed reviews and the code's static, schema-like nature, I concur with the reports. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign type definition module for AWS SDK in Python, posing no security threat.",
