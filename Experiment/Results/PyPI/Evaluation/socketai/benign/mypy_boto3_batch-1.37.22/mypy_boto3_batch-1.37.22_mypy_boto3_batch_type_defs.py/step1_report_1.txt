{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Batch service types in Python, primarily used for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Static data definitions, imports, and type annotations. No external data inputs or untrusted sources are directly read in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only defines data types and structures. No data processing, output, or external connections are made.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic present. The code uses conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It includes only static, declarative structures for AWS Batch types, with no functions, external calls, or runtime logic that could be malicious. The initial docstring provides documentation link and license info. The structure and content are consistent with standard SDK or type stub generation for AWS services. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, static type definition module for AWS Batch service in Python. It contains no executable or dynamic code that could be malicious. The structure and purpose are solely for type safety and validation, posing no security threat.",
