  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code in detail, working through each aspect systematically.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a large collection of Python type annotations, TypedDict classes, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions.\n- It defines data structures for AWS Batch service models, likely used for static type checking, validation, or SDK schema definitions.\n- There are no functions, dynamic logic, external calls, or data processing routines.\n- The code is static, declarative, and purely structural.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, and the type annotations are consistent with Python typing standards.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No runtime code, dynamic execution, or external data handling present.\n- **Secrets or hardcoded credentials:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns:** None present; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The code relies heavily on conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility.\n- No apparent logical errors or mistakes in the type definitions.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated patterns.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is transparent, static, and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — The code is purely declarative, with no runtime behavior or external data handling.\n\n### Critical analysis of each report:\nAll five reports uniformly state that:\n- The code is solely static type definitions.\n- No external data processing, network calls, or dynamic code.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The purpose is for type safety, validation, or SDK schema.\n\nThe confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a static schema for AWS Batch types, intended for type checking and validation.  \n- It contains no executable logic, no external data handling, no secrets, and no obfuscation.  \n- The extensive use of type annotations and conditional imports is standard practice for SDK or type stub modules.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a legitimate, static type definition module for AWS Batch in Python. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe provided reports are accurate in their assessment. I agree with their conclusions that the code is safe, static, and free of malicious content. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
