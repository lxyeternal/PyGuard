{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Batch service interactions, providing type safety and clarity for SDK or API usage.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (sys, typing, builtins, collections.abc, typing_extensions); type definitions including NotRequired, Literal, Union, Dict, List, Sequence, Mapping; data sources are mainly type annotations for API request and response structures.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted input or data processing; data structures are for API communication, not executing or processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external API requests/responses into well-defined data structures, no execution or evaluation of dynamic code or untrusted input; type annotations enforce data integrity.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears solely as type definitions and imports with no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No code injection, dynamic code eval, or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of TypedDict definitions, conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, and type annotations for data structures used in AWS Batch SDK interactions. No executable logic, no input handling, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The purpose is to provide strong typing for API request/response objects. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are detected. The code is standard for SDK or API schema definition, with no indicators of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and data structure definitions intended for AWS Batch SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, purely declarative module for type safety. Overall security risk is very low.",
