  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Batch SDK in Python.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or external I/O is present.\n- The code uses standard patterns for compatibility across Python versions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The purpose appears solely to facilitate type checking, validation, and documentation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The data structures align with AWS Batch API models, indicating they are likely auto-generated or SDK schema files.\n- The reports consistently assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0. This code contains no malicious payloads, dynamic code, or executable logic.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques.\n- **Risk score:** 0. Given the static, declarative nature and absence of runtime or external interactions, the security risk is negligible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, static type definition module for AWS Batch in Python.\n- No security concerns or malicious intent are evident.\n- The high confidence scores across reports reinforce this assessment.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
