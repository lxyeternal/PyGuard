  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Batch service in Python, primarily used for type checking and data validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters for various functions and configurations, and imports from __future__, sys, typing, and local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed; the code primarily defines data types and constants.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to type definitions, with no runtime data processing, input/output operations, or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is purely type definitions and imports. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation features are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports based on Python version. It imports various type literals and uses Union to combine type options. There are no functions, runtime logic, or data manipulations that could be malicious. The structure indicates it's intended for static type checking and documentation. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are detectable in this static, declarative code.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a collection of type definitions for AWS Batch in Python, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured static code intended for type safety and clarity.",
