{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Batch service models, facilitating type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (__future__, sys, typing, typing_extensions, collections.abc) and internal literals modules; class definitions with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, external network calls, or sensitive data handling are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within data structure definitions, with no runtime data processing or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of type definitions, with no executable logic, external input handling, or dynamic code execution; no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a comprehensive set of TypedDict classes representing AWS Batch API models, with conditional imports for compatibility, and extensive use of type annotations. It does not contain executable logic, network operations, or security-sensitive functions. The purpose appears solely to facilitate static type checking and documentation. No indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscated code are observed. The structure and content are typical for a type stub or SDK data model definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of type definitions for AWS Batch service models. It does not perform any runtime actions, data processing, or external communication. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the provided content.",
