{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Batch SDK in Python, intended for type checking, validation, and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Purely static data definitions, class declarations, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility; no external data sources or runtime input.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data flow at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code consists solely of static type annotations and data schemas without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code detected; standard conditional imports are used for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of static TypedDict classes and type annotations for AWS Batch, with conditional imports based on Python version. It contains no executable code, external data handling, or dynamic behavior. The structure is straightforward, serving as a schema or type stub for SDK validation or static analysis. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's purpose is purely declarative, aimed at type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, static type definition module for AWS Batch in Python. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The high confidence in this assessment is supported by the absence of runtime logic, external data handling, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
