  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Batch service interactions, providing schema validation for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, typing, and literals; type definitions and class declarations, including potential data validation and structural logic.",
  "sinks": "None identified that directly process untrusted external input; all definitions are static type annotations and data schemas intended for validation or serialization.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code defines data structures and type annotations without dynamic input handling or data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is solely focused on type annotations, data schemas, and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and type extension libraries, then defines a series of TypedDict classes, Unions, and constants used for AWS Batch API schema validation. There are no functions, runtime logic, or external input processing. No indications of code injection, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be a straightforward static typing schema file for a Python SDK or API client. The use of type hints, version-specific imports, and data schemas is consistent with standard SDK design patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign schema and type definition module with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely provides static type annotations for AWS Batch API interactions, with no runtime or dynamic behavior that could be exploited.",
