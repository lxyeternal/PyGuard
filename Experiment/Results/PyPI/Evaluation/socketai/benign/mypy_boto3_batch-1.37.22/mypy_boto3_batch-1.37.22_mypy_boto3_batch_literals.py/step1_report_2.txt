  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service configurations and constants used in boto3-stubs for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module; conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; defining various Literal type aliases and constants.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code only defines type aliases and constants without processing untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only establishes type annotations and static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; only static definitions. The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future but not suspicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on Python version, then defines multiple type alias variables as string literals representing AWS resource names, statuses, and configuration options. The 'ALL' tuple contains all exported names. No functions, input handling, or data processing is present. No obfuscated code, external code execution, or dynamic behaviors are detected. The code appears to serve as a static type hints module for AWS SDK stubs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static definitions module providing string literal types for type hinting in boto3 stubs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious activities. All elements serve a documentation and typing purpose only.",
