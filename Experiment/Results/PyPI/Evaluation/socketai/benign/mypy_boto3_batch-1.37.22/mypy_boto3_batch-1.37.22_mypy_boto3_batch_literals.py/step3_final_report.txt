  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS SDK literals, providing static type hints for resource names, statuses, and configurations.",
  "sources": "Static string literals and type alias definitions; no runtime data or external input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data flow.",
  "flows": "None; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year 2025 is future-dated, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal for various AWS resource strings. No dynamic code, no data leaks, no network activity, and no obfuscation are present. The conditional import for 'Literal' is standard practice for compatibility. The extensive list of literals is typical for such type annotation modules. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS SDK literals, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, likely a placeholder, which does not impact security.",
