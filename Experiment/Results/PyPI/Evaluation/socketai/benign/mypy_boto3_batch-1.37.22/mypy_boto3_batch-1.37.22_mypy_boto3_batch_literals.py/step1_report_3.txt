  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS Batch and related service configurations to be used with type annotations in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys and typing/Literal, and the assignments of various Literal types for constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only defines type aliases and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward type definition for documentation and type checking purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version for conditional import of Literal, then defines numerous Literal type aliases for different AWS service configurations, constants, and resource names. No data input, output, or execution logic is present. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. All code is purely declarative, serving as type annotations for external use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured set of type alias definitions for AWS-related string literals, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely as type annotations for better code documentation and static analysis.",
