  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS SDK literals; no external data or runtime data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing, no external input or output.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; the copyright year (2025) is future-dated but not suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely static type alias definitions for AWS resource strings. No dynamic code, no network activity, no obfuscation, no secrets. The initial docstring with usage examples is standard documentation.\n\n**Malware & Security Risk:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious code detected.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is accurate. The code is safe, straightforward, and purely for type annotations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, defining string literal types for AWS configurations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No processing of untrusted data; only static definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; the future year (2025) is noted but not problematic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a static set of type aliases, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The extensive list of literals is typical for AWS SDK typings.\n\n**Malware & Security Risk:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is correct. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS Batch and related service string literals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing; only static type aliasing.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; the code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static definitions for type checking, with no dynamic or malicious code. The code is standard for type annotations.\n\n**Malware & Security Risk:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malware detected.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — no security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type alias definitions for AWS Batch and services.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; the code is purely declarative.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Serves as static type annotations, with no runtime logic or malicious intent.\n\n**Malware & Security Risk:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malware.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS SDK parameters and constants as literals; minimal input handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No processing of untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** Extensive hardcoded literals are typical; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type definitions for documentation and type checking. No malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior.\n\n**Malware & Security Risk:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malware detected.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — no security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static type alias definitions for AWS resource string literals.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0.0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Security Risks:** The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain secrets. The only notable aspect is extensive hardcoded literals, which are standard for such static definitions.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are correctly assigned as 0.0 across all reports.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the nature of the code, a security risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** The code is clear and straightforward; obfuscated scores of 0.0 are justified.\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose and content. The code is purely static type annotations for AWS SDK literals, with no malicious or security-threatening elements.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the assessments in the reports.",
