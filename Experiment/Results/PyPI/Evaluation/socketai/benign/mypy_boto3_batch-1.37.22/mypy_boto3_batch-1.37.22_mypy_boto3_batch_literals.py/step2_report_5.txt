  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code defines static type annotations for AWS SDK literals. No dynamic code, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Clearly states no malware or security risks, with a confidence of 1.0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The code is straightforward type alias definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly notes the code's role in defining string literal types for AWS services, with no data processing or external input.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No signs of malicious behavior; the future-dated copyright is not suspicious.\n- **Verdict:** Valid. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes the code as static type definitions for AWS Batch and related services, with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No malicious behavior or security concerns.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code's role as a static set of type aliases for AWS configurations, with no dynamic or external data handling.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Sound evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Appropriately describes the code as extensive hardcoded string literals for AWS parameters, used for type annotations.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** No malicious behavior or security risks identified.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports consistently recognize that this code is purely static type annotation definitions for AWS SDK literals. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — The code contains no malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — The code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risks are present.\n\n**Final note:** The only minor point is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a typo or placeholder and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, static collection of type annotations for AWS resource string literals, with no malicious or security-threatening components. It serves as a helpful documentation and type checking aid for AWS SDK usage in Python.",
