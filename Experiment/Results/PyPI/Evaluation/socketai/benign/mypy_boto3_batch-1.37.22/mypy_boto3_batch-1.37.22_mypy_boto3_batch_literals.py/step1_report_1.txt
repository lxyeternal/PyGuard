  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal types used in AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to enable type checking and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Type annotations are assigned directly to variables; no data input or external sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code is solely type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely type definition code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and consistent with type annotation practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports conditional typing extensions based on Python version and defines multiple string literal types for AWS resource identifiers and configurations. It contains no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, no network operations, and no obfuscated or malicious logic. All variables are static type annotations for documentation and type checking purposes only. The initial docstring includes example usage and documentation links, with no indications of malicious intent. Overall, the code is a standard set of type definitions for AWS SDK literals, with no signs of malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining type annotations and contains no malicious or security risks. It is safe for use and does not pose any threat.",
