{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS SDK parameters and configurations, primarily for type annotations and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string literals assigned to variables and imported modules. The only input-related element is the sys.version_info check for conditional import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely establishes type aliases using literals.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive hardcoded string literals for AWS resource names, regions, and configuration options. The initial comment mentions licensing and documentation but no malicious behavior. The conditional import based on Python version is standard and harmless. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a type definitions module for AWS SDK integration, providing clearly defined string literal types for various parameters. The presence of numerous hardcoded constants is typical for such configuration or annotation modules. The conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version is standard practice for compatibility and poses no security threat. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The code appears well-structured and intended solely for static type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign set of type aliases and constants used for documentation and type checking. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The extensive hardcoded literals are typical and do not indicate sabotage or malware.",
