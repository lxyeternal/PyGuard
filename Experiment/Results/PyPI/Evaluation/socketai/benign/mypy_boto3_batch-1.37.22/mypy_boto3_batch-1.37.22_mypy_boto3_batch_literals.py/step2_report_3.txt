  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims and ensure consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS SDK literals; no external data or runtime data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or transmission; purely static.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; the copyright year 2025 is in the future but not suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code consists of static type aliases for AWS resource names and statuses, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward static type definitions module with no security issues.\n\n**Risk & Malware Scores:** Both at 0.0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, defining string literal types for AWS service constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No unusual behavior; the future copyright year is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static definitions serving as type hints, with no malicious logic.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; the code is purely static and safe.\n\n**Scores:** Both at 0.0, consistent with the report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for AWS Batch and related services.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external input.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; the code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type alias definitions, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; no security risks or malware.\n\n**Scores:** Both at 0.0, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions for AWS Batch and services.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; the code is purely declarative.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Serves as static type annotations, safe and standard.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid; no issues detected.\n\n**Scores:** Both at 0.0, matching the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for AWS SDK parameters; extensive hardcoded literals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** The large number of hardcoded constants is typical for such modules.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type definitions, no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly notes the benign nature and standard purpose of the code.\n\n**Scores:** Both at 0.0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** The code is purely static type alias definitions for AWS SDK literals.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, indicating no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** None of the reports identify any security issues; the code is safe.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- The code contains no runtime logic, no external data handling, no network calls, no obfuscated code, or secrets.\n- The extensive use of hardcoded string literals is typical for type annotations and does not pose security risks.\n- The conditional import based on Python version is standard practice and harmless.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe static type definitions module for AWS SDK literals, with no malicious or security concerns.",
