{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal types used in AWS Batch and related services for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module to determine Python version; assignment of string literals to type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; code only defines type literals and does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code solely establishes type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to conditionally import Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, then defines multiple Literal type aliases for AWS Batch configurations and other service names. These are static definitions for type checking, with no runtime data processing or external data input. There are no functions, network calls, file operations, or other potentially malicious constructs. Overall, the code appears to be purely declarative and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for AWS-related string literals, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as documentation and type safety enhancement for AWS SDK usage, with no suspicious or harmful components.",
