{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface module for AWS Batch, importing paginator classes and the BatchClient, then exposing them for external use with documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal submodules (.client and .paginator), static documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, environment variables, or external inputs; no sinks that could leak data or execute code.",
  "flows": "Import statements and alias assignment; no dynamic data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward import/export structure; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured Python module that imports classes and functions from internal submodules, defines an alias, and exposes symbols via __all__. The documentation provides usage examples but contains no executable code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The existing scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
