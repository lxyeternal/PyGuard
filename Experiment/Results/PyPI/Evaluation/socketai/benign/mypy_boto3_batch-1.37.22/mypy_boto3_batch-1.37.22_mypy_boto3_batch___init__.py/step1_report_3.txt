{
  "purpose": "Main interface for batch service, providing imports and initializations for interacting with AWS Batch via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator) and standard library (though none used here).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this is a module defining classes and re-exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of import statements, type alias, and __all__ declaration. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific classes and functions from internal submodules, defines a Client alias, and specifies __all__ for export. The structure aligns with typical package interface design. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, hidden code, or malicious payloads. No external data is processed or transmitted. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code appears to be a standard, benign package interface module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that exposes classes and paginators for AWS Batch interaction. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment.",
