  "purpose": "Utility functions for image handling, model role generation, request parsing, and exporting topology data to XML format for visualization.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads for static images, request GET parameters, configuration settings, static URL and path manipulations.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem access during image encoding, URL string manipulations, XML data generation.",
  "flows": "Request parameters and configuration data influence filesystem reads and XML export; images are read from disk and embedded into XML.",
  "anomalies": "Use of version-dependent string removal functions; filesystem reads for static assets are standard; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions related to static content management and XML export for topology visualization. No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are present. Filesystem reads are limited to static assets, and request parameters are handled straightforwardly. No signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing typical static content handling and data export functions. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk reflects standard filesystem access and request handling without vulnerabilities.",
