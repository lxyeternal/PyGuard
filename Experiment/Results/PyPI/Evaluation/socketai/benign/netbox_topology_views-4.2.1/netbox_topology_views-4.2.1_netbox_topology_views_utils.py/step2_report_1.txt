  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and score appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for image handling, model roles, request parsing, and XML export. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis:** No code injection, reverse shells, or network activity. Filesystem reads are limited to static assets. No hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the benign nature. The risk score is low, acknowledging minimal potential issues like filesystem access.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, straightforward data handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No code injection or network activity. Base64 encoding images for embedding is standard. No secrets or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, filesystem image reads, XML export, no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** No injection, network activity, or secrets. Potential concern about reading images directly from disk, but standard for such features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility code, filesystem reads, no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No code injection, network activity, or secrets. Reading static images is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 (no risk). Slightly higher risk scores (0.2) in previous reports are acceptable; here, 0 is also fine.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, filesystem image reading, XML export, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No code injection, network activity, or secrets. Filesystem access is standard for static content.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 or 0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware=0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are straightforward, non-obfuscated code; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** The minimal risk scores (0 or 0.2) are reasonable given the code's functions—mainly filesystem reads and data formatting.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the filesystem reads and data handling, a conservative risk score around 0.1 to 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal potential for issues like directory traversal if paths are manipulated, but overall low risk.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk scores around 0.1–0.2.  \n- The code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious intent or significant security concerns.",
