  "purpose": "Define and configure a plugin for NetBox topology views",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks points identified; no untrusted data processing or external calls",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a plugin configuration class with static properties such as name, description, version, author info, and default settings. The 'ready' method imports a signals module, which is a common pattern in Django apps for initializing signal handlers. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are detected. The code appears to be a standard plugin configuration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward plugin configuration for NetBox without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
