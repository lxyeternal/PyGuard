  "purpose": "Defines a plugin configuration class for a NetBox plugin, setting metadata and default settings.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes, import of local signals module in ready() method",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, user input, or network interactions",
  "flows": "Initialization flow from class definition to import of signals during plugin setup",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django plugin configuration class with static metadata and default settings. The 'ready()' method imports a local signals module, which is typical for initializing signal handlers. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All signals and patterns are consistent with benign plugin setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard plugin configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and justified.",
