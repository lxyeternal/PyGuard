  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets configuration variables and imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The email address appears generic, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a plugin configuration class with static metadata and default settings. It imports a signals module during initialization, which is common for event handling. No user input, network communication, or sensitive data handling occurs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a standard plugin configuration without any malicious intent or security risks. It simply registers plugin metadata and defaults. No suspicious activity or malicious behavior detected.",
