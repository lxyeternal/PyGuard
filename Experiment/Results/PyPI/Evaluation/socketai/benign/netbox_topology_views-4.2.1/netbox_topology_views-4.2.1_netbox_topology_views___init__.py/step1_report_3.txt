  "purpose": "Define configuration for the netbox_topology_views plugin, including metadata and default settings.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Configuration class setup and plugin registration; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a plugin configuration class, defines a subclass with metadata and default settings, and initializes the plugin configuration. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling. The only dynamic action is importing signals within the 'ready' method, which is standard for plugin initialization. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard plugin configuration class without malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical pattern for plugin setup with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
