{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of choice options for node labels, likely used in a selection interface or form.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static class attributes and list defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted data; purely static data definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a module, then defines a subclass with class variables representing identifiers for node label choices. The CHOICES list pairs these identifiers with human-readable labels. All data is static and hardcoded. No external inputs, environment variables, or dynamic execution is involved. The structure appears to be standard for defining choice sets in many frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static class defining constants for choice options without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is normal application code with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
