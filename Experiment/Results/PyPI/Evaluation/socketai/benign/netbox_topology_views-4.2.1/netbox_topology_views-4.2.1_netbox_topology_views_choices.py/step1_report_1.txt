{
  "purpose": "Define a set of choices for node label items, likely used for selection or form options.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive points; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated parts, or hardcoded secrets. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class, defines a subclass with constants for different node labels, and creates a choices list pairing internal identifiers with display labels. There are no user inputs, network calls, or data processing that could lead to security issues. The structure appears typical for Django or similar frameworks for choice fields.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, static definition of choices for node labels with no malicious behavior detected. It is safe and contains no malware or security risks.",
