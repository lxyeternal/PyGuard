{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of label choices for node-related attributes, likely used for form selection or data categorization.",
  "sources": "Imports ChoiceSet from utilities.choices; class attributes for labels; CHOICES list.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not process untrusted input or write data externally.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static class definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class inheritance defining constant string values and a list of choice tuples. It imports a likely utility class, and the choices are human-readable labels mapped to internal string keys. There are no signs of data processing, external communication, or malicious intent. The structure appears typical for configuration or form choice options.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for defining choices in a Python application, and shows no malicious behavior or security risks.",
