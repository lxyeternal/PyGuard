{
  "purpose": "Define a set of labeled choices for node label items in a system, likely used for configuration or UI selection.",
  "sources": "Import from utilities.choices module; class attributes with predefined string values.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data processing or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static attribute definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class NodeLabelItems inheriting from ChoiceSet, with four class attributes representing different node labels. It also defines a CHOICES list pairing each attribute with a human-readable label. The code appears to be a straightforward enumeration of options for use elsewhere, with no external input, data manipulation, or side effects. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, safe enumeration of node label choices without any malicious intent or security issues. It is likely used for configuration or selection purposes within a larger application.",
