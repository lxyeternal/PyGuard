  "purpose": "Define a set of node label identifiers for use in configuration or UI choices.",
  "sources": "Static class variables within the code; no external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward static class with constants and choices list.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility class, defines constants for node labels, and creates a choices list pairing each constant with a human-readable label. It is static, with no user input, network activity, or dynamic behavior. The code is typical for configuration purposes, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, and assign scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these scores. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration class defining node label choices. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
