  "purpose": "Models for topology visualization, role images, coordinate groups, and user options management within a Django application, primarily handling static assets and device placement data.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths constructed from settings.STATIC_ROOT and model fields; URL generation via Django's static and reverse functions.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem access for images; URL references for static assets; database queries for model data.",
  "flows": "Model fields (e.g., 'image') used to build filesystem paths and URLs; filesystem existence checks; URL generation for static assets.",
  "anomalies": "Repetitive default group creation logic; no validation or sanitization of 'self.image' before filesystem access; standard Django patterns without obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Django models for managing topology visualization assets and device placement. Filesystem paths are constructed using static settings and model fields, with existence checks that raise errors if files are missing. URL generation uses Django's static and reverse utilities, which are standard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling is present. The repeated pattern for creating default coordinate groups is safe but could be refactored for DRYness. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django ORM and utility code for topology visualization, with safe filesystem and URL handling. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The low risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
