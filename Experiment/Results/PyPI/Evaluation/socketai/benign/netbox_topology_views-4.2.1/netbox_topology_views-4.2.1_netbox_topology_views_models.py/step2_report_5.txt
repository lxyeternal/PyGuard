  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, focusing on the key points: code presence, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and potential malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines Django models for role images and coordinate groups, with functions for filesystem paths, static URLs, and default image fallbacks.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity. The filesystem path handling with `Path(settings.STATIC_ROOT) / self.image` is standard, and the fallback mechanisms are safe.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe and standard is justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on model definitions for topology visualization, filesystem access, and URL generation.\n- **Findings:** Repetitive default group creation logic is noted but is a common pattern. No malicious code or network activity detected.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no changes required.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focus on coordinate models, device placements, and user options. Filesystem and URL handling are standard.\n- **Findings:** Repetitive code for default group creation, but no malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is typical for such applications.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** Valid conclusion; no modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar focus on topology models, filesystem paths, and URL generation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious logic or malicious activity. Path and URL handling are standard. No signs of obfuscation or hidden backdoors.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, fitting the description.\n- **Assessment:** Correct assessment; no changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focus on topology models, coordinate placement, and role images, with standard filesystem and URL operations.\n- **Findings:** No malicious indicators or suspicious behavior. The code is typical for such a plugin.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as Django models for topology visualization.\n- **Logic & Flaws:** No logical flaws or security issues are evident. Repetitive default group creation logic is noted but is standard and safe.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign `malware` and `obfuscated` scores as 0, which is consistent with their findings.\n- **Potential Malicious Behavior:** No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or external data exfiltration.\n- **Data Flows & Sinks:** Filesystem paths, static URLs, and database queries are handled securely, with appropriate error handling.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minimal, mainly due to filesystem path handling, but within normal bounds for such code.\n\n**In conclusion**, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured Django implementation for topology visualization, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Recommended final scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**  | **0**       | **0.2** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
