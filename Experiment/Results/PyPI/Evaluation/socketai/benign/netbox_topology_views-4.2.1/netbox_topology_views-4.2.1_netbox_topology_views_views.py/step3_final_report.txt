{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Django-based visualization tool for network topology, generating nodes and edges from device, circuit, power, and wireless data, and rendering HTML content for display.",
  "sources": "Data is read from database models (Device, Circuit, PowerPanel, PowerFeed, WirelessLink, etc.), user input via GET parameters, and model fields (e.g., role, serial, IP).",
  "sinks": "Generated JSON data for topology visualization, HTML embedded in node titles, external URLs via get_absolute_url(), and image URLs.",
  "flows": "User input influences visualization parameters; data flows from models into JSON nodes/edges; HTML content is generated for node titles; URLs are constructed for navigation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, eval or exec, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity. Potential XSS risk exists due to HTML in node titles, but this is typical in such applications and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django application that retrieves data from models, processes user options, and constructs JSON structures for visualization. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or backdoors are present. HTML embedded in node titles could pose XSS if model fields contain malicious HTML, but this is a common web app concern. The code is clear, maintainable, and uses conventional patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Django visualization backend with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor security concern is potential XSS in HTML content, which is a standard web security issue, not malicious. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified and consistent.",
