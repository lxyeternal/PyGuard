  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Django visualization backend with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor security concern is potential XSS in HTML content, which is a standard web security issue, not malicious. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified and consistent."
