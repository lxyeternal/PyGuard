  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; package metadata from setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of package metadata without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The reports provided are empty, containing only 'Empty response' errors, and do not offer any evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The code reads a README file, defines package info, and calls setup(), all standard practices. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or external network interactions are present. Given the lack of evidence, the code appears safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is standard and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. Therefore, the package is considered safe, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to 0.",
