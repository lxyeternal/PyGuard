  "purpose": "This code defines a static plugin menu structure for NetBox, including menu items, buttons, icons, and permissions, with no dynamic or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded links, icons, permissions, and static class instances within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of menu items and buttons; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration for a plugin menu, using predefined classes and data. It contains no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All signals point to benign, standard UI setup. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The permissions and links are internal references, and the structure aligns with typical plugin menu definitions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static plugin menu configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
