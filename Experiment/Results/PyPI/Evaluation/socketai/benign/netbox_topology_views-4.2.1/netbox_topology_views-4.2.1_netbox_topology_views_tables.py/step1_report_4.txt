  "purpose": "Define data table structures for various coordinate-related models in a Django-based application, primarily for rendering tabular views with linkified columns.",
  "sources": "Import statements for django_tables2, netbox.tables, and models from netbox_topology_views.models",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks; table columns are configured for display and linking, not data processing or storage",
  "flows": "The code defines table classes and fields; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no runtime data processing observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines several table classes inheriting from NetBoxTable. Each class specifies columns with linkify options and associated Meta classes for model mapping. There are no input/output data processing, user input handling, or dynamic code segments. The code appears to be straightforward, standard Django table definitions, without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines table structures for display purposes within a Django application. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. It appears to be a standard, benign implementation.",
