{
  "purpose": "Define several Django table classes for visualizing coordinate-related models in a web interface.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules and models, defines classes and fields, uses linkify to generate hyperlinks.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input; linkify is used for displaying data with links.",
  "flows": "Data from models is displayed through tables with linkified fields; no data flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. No dynamic code execution or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines several table classes inheriting from NetBoxTable, and specifies model fields and linkify options. No user input handling, no data manipulation, and no external network interactions are present. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard Django practices for table display. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django table definitions for model display, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical implementation for rendering model data in a web interface.",
