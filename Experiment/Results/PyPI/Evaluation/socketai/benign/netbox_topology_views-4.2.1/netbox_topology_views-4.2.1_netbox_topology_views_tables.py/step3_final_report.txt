  "purpose": "Define Django table classes for displaying coordinate-related models with linkified fields in a web interface.",
  "sources": "Model fields such as 'name', 'group', 'device', 'x', 'y' used in table columns with linkify=True.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data is displayed via linkify, which depends on model data but does not process external input.",
  "flows": "Model fields flow into table columns; linkify converts field data into hyperlinks for display.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard Django table class definitions and no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and models, then defines multiple table classes inheriting from NetBoxTable. Each class specifies columns with linkify=True for related model fields. No user input handling, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The code is static and purely for rendering data. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified. The only minor concern is the 'securityRisk' score of 0.1 in one report, which is unwarranted given the static, display-only nature of the code. Therefore, the overall assessment is that the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of Django tables for model display, with no malicious or security issues. The scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0, aligning with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
