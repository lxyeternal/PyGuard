  "purpose": "Define and configure various table views for coordinate-related models in a NetBox topology visualization plugin.",
  "sources": "Imports from django_tables2, netbox.tables, and models from netbox_topology_views.models.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Models are used to generate table columns, with linkify options for displaying related objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines table classes for visual representation, using standard Django Tables2 and model fields. It employs linkify for URLs. No user input processing, network activity, or sensitive data handling appears. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of table definitions for a Django application, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a purely functional purpose without any malicious intent.",
