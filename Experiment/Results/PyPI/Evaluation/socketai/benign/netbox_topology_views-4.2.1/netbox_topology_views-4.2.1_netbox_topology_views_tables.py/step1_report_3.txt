  "purpose": "Define Django tables for various coordinate-related models in a network topology application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external libraries and models, class attributes defining table columns.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model data to table columns; no external untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is straightforward model-to-table mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines multiple table classes extending NetBoxTable. Each class configures columns, mostly with linkify attributes for URL linking. All classes specify model associations and field selections. There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, or suspicious logic. The code is typical for a Django application implementing admin tables and does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Django table definitions for models related to network coordinates. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and does not perform any operations that could compromise system security.",
