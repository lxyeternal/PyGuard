  "purpose": "Define tables for displaying coordinate-related models in a Django web application using django-tables2.",
  "sources": "Imports django_tables2 and models from netbox.tables and netbox_topology_views.models.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; code primarily defines table schemas with linkify properties.",
  "flows": "Import statements → Table class definitions and Meta configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries and models, then defines multiple table classes for different coordinate models. Each table uses linkify to turn certain fields into hyperlinks. The Meta classes specify model associations and visible fields. No user input handling, network operations, or code injection mechanisms are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward, intended for displaying database models in tabular format within a Django app. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this code segment.",
