  "purpose": "This code defines a signal handler to delete associated RoleImage objects when a DeviceRole instance is deleted.",
  "sources": "ContentType.objects.get_for_model(sender) and RoleImage.objects.filter(...).delete()",
  "sinks": "RoleImage.objects.filter(...).delete() potentially deletes data based on model instance deletion",
  "flows": "pre_delete signal triggers delete_hanging_role_image, which then queries ContentType and deletes RoleImage objects linked to the DeviceRole instance",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, straightforward signal handling; no unusual or obfuscated code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code listens for the pre_delete signal on DeviceRole. When triggered, it retrieves the content type for the sender model and deletes related RoleImage entries. The logic is clear, standard, and does not perform any network activity or system modifications beyond database cleanup. No malicious behavior or backdoors are present. It is a typical Django signal handler for maintaining data integrity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django signal handler intended to clean up related data upon deletion of a DeviceRole instance. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
