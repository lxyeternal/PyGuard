  "purpose": "Automatically delete associated RoleImage records when a DeviceRole instance is deleted to maintain database consistency.",
  "sources": "ContentType.objects.get_for_model(sender), RoleImage.objects.filter(content_type=ct, object_id=instance.id).delete()",
  "sinks": "Database queries that delete RoleImage objects based on ContentType and object_id",
  "flows": "On pre_delete signal, retrieves ContentType for sender, then deletes RoleImage entries linked via content_type and object_id",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or unusual patterns; standard Django ORM usage",
  "analysis": "The code uses Django signals to perform cleanup tasks during deletion of DeviceRole instances. It retrieves the ContentType for the sender model and deletes associated RoleImage records based on content_type and object_id. No user input handling, no external network calls, and no dynamic code execution are present. The logic is straightforward and follows common Django patterns for maintaining referential integrity.\n\nThere are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden operations. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose within the application’s data model management.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard cleanup operation upon deletion of DeviceRole objects without any malicious intent. There are no security risks or malware indications. It is a typical Django signal handler ensuring data consistency.",
