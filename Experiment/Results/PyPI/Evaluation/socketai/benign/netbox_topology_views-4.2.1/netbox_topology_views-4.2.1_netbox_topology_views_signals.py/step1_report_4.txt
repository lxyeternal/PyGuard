  "purpose": "Automatically delete RoleImage objects associated with a DeviceRole when it is about to be deleted, to prevent hanging references.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code interacts with Django ORM to access the database.",
  "sinks": "Database delete operations via RoleImage.objects.filter(...).delete().",
  "flows": "Pre-delete signal from DeviceRole triggers deletion of related RoleImage entries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard Django signals and ORM methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a signal receiver for the pre_delete signal of DeviceRole. When a DeviceRole instance is about to be deleted, it retrieves the ContentType for the model and deletes all RoleImage objects associated with that content type and object ID. The logic is straightforward, utilizing standard Django ORM features. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The deletion process appears safe and intended for cleanup. The code does not process untrusted input directly, and no unsafe operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a safe cleanup operation upon deletion of DeviceRole instances. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The logic is clear, standard, and intended for data integrity.",
