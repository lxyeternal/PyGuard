{
  "purpose": "To automatically delete related RoleImage objects when a DeviceRole instance is deleted, maintaining database integrity.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sender class (DeviceRole), the instance's ID, and the ContentType for the sender.",
  "sinks": "The filter and delete operations on RoleImage objects based on content_type and object_id.",
  "flows": "pre_delete signal is triggered when a DeviceRole instance is deleted, leading to retrieval of ContentType and deletion of related RoleImage entries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, and no signs of malicious behavior. Usage of Django signals and ORM appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a signal receiver for the pre_delete event of DeviceRole. Upon deletion of a DeviceRole instance, it fetches the corresponding ContentType and deletes associated RoleImage entries. All operations rely on Django ORM and signal mechanisms, which are standard practices. No external inputs, environment variables, or external network activity are involved. The code's intent seems to be data cleanup and maintaining referential integrity. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward, standard cleanup task using Django signals. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is a typical application of Django ORM and signals with no evident security risks or obfuscation.",
