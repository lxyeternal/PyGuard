  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Django signal handler.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or external inputs are involved.\n- The purpose is data cleanup, which is a common pattern.\n- The code relies on Django ORM and signals, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code appears correct and straightforward. No issues or bugs are identified.\n   - The logic is sound: on pre_delete of `DeviceRole`, delete related `RoleImage` objects based on content type and object ID.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no flaws are evident.\n   - They correctly identify the code as standard, safe, and without malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The \"securityRisk\" scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n   - The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The \"confidence\" scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is safe, the risk scores should remain low.\n   - No justification exists for increasing malware or security risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - Confirmed as 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on direct analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies noted.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — the code performs a standard cleanup operation with no security concerns.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe Django pattern for cleaning up related data upon deletion of a model instance. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
