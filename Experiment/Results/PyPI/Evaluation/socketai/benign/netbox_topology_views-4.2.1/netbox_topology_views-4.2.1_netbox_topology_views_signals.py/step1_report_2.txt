{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Django signal receiver that deletes associated RoleImage records when a DeviceRole instance is deleted.",
  "sources": "The code reads the DeviceRole instance during pre_delete signal handling and retrieves ContentType information based on the sender class.",
  "sinks": "The code performs deletion on RoleImage objects filtered by content type and object ID, which could potentially lead to unintended data removal if misused or misconfigured.",
  "flows": "When a DeviceRole instance is about to be deleted, the signal handler retrieves its content type and deletes all RoleImage entries linked to that instance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual language features, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard Django ORM patterns; no suspicious or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a Django pre_delete signal to automatically clean up related RoleImage records when a DeviceRole is deleted. It uses ContentType to identify the model type and filters RoleImage objects accordingly. The implementation appears straightforward and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. There are no external inputs or untrusted data sources, and the code does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration. The approach reduces the risk of orphaned RoleImage records but does not introduce any security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django signal handler for cleanup of related records upon deletion of a DeviceRole. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears correct and safe.",
