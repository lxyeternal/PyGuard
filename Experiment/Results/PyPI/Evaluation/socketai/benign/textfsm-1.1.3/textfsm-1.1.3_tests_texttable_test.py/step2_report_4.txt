  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for the 'texttable' module.\n   - The code only imports standard libraries and the 'textfsm' package, which is a known open-source module.\n   - The code contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, file system modifications, or use of untrusted input sources beyond controlled test data.\n   - No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are evident.\n   - The code's purpose is solely to verify the correctness of table and row manipulations, formatting, sorting, filtering, and display.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent in the analysis.\n   - The reasoning that the code is safe and purely for testing purposes is sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the absence of malicious behavior, the risk score should be 0.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The code is strictly for testing; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are based on untrusted input or external dependencies.\n   - The 'textfsm' and 'texttable' modules are open-source and well-known, with no evidence of compromise.\n   - No code patterns suggest malicious intent or supply chain attack.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.\n   - No need to adjust scores based on the analysis.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign, well-structured test suite.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** The scores are appropriate given the nature of the code. If any score higher than 0.5 were assigned, it would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, open-source unit testing suite with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. All reports are accurate and consistent with this conclusion.",
