{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'terminal' module, primarily testing ANSI escape sequences, terminal size detection, line wrapping, and pager behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), system input/output, and data passed as function arguments (e.g., text strings).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to sys.stdout via the FakeTerminal class, but no untrusted input is directly written to system or network resources.",
  "flows": "Input data (text strings or environment variables) flows into formatting functions, which then produce ANSI-encoded strings or formatted output. No external data sources are directly used for security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code behaviors. It uses standard library functions, no hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests for terminal-related functionalities, including ANSI text formatting, terminal size detection, line wrapping, and paging behavior. It uses mock classes and functions to simulate terminal behaviors. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. All data flows are within the scope of testing and do not interact with external systems in a suspicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing the terminal module's functionality and does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It does not process or transmit untrusted data beyond standard test data, and no security vulnerabilities are evident.",
