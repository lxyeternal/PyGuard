{
  "purpose": "Provide a workaround for a Python 2.6 bug related to copying regex objects, enabling regex objects to be copied and deep-copied.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only initializes regex patterns and compiles them within the class constructor.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows, as the code does not process external data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the class simply encapsulates regex compilation and copying functionality.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or unusual code patterns. The purpose is clear, and no suspicious activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class to make regex objects copyable, addressing a Python 2.6 limitation. It imports the re module, defines a class with methods for matching, substitution, copying, and deep copying. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no network activities, and no handling of sensitive information. The code appears as a utility component, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility to enable copying regex objects in Python 2.6. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and is a standard, well-understood pattern. Overall, the code is safe and purely functional.",
