{
  "purpose": "Provide a workaround for a Python 2.6 bug related to copying regex objects by creating a copyable regex wrapper class.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'pattern' parameter during initialization and the 're' module for regex compilation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Pattern input flows into the re.compile function; the class methods utilize this for matching and substitution. No external data flow to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The code implements a straightforward workaround for a known bug without obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'CopyableRegexObject' which wraps around Python's regex object, enabling copying by reusing the pattern. It only interacts with standard library modules and performs no file I/O, network communication, or data processing beyond regex operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, and no evident attempts at obfuscation or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, straightforward workaround for a known Python 2.6 issue with regex object copying. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and is safe for use.",
