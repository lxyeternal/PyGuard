{
  "purpose": "Provide a workaround for a Python 2.6 bug related to copying re.RegexObject instances.",
  "sources": "The code reads the regex pattern during initialization and compiles it; no external input is processed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code only creates regex objects and copies them internally.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a compatibility utility for regex objects; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The presence of 'from builtins import object' suggests code compatibility adjustments but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class to enable copying regex objects in Python 2.6, addressing a known bug. It only involves regex pattern compilation and object copying. There are no input/output operations, no data leaks, no environment variable manipulations, and no network activity. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious code segments. Overall, this appears to be a benign utility module intended for internal use within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply facilitates copying regex objects, which is a standard programming task. There is no evidence of malware, data leaks, or security threats.",
