  "purpose": "A utility class to make regex objects copyable, addressing a Python 2.6 bug that renders re.RegexObject uncopyable.",
  "sources": "The pattern string provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "The pattern is stored and compiled; match and sub methods operate on inputs but do not process untrusted data or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard regex operations and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that stores a regex pattern, compiles it, and provides match and substitution methods. It implements copying methods to address a known bug in Python 2.6. It uses only standard modules and has no external data handling, network activity, or side effects. The code is simple, clear, and purpose-specific, with no security flaws or malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified based on the benign nature and lack of external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, compatibility utility with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
