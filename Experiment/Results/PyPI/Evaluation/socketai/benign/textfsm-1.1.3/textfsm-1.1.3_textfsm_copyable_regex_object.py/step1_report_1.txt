  "purpose": "Provides a workaround for a Python 2.6 bug by creating a copyable regex object class.",
  "sources": "The class __init__ method reads the pattern parameter; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only manipulates regex objects internally.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no unusual language features, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to allow copying regex objects, primarily for compatibility reasons. It uses standard Python 're' module functions and the built-in 'object' class. There are no indications of malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate regex object copying, with no side effects or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended as a compatibility workaround, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
