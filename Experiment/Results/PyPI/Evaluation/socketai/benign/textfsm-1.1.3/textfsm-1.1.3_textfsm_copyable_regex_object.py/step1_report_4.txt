{
  "purpose": "Provides a workaround for a Python 2.6 bug by creating a copyable regex object wrapper.",
  "sources": "The code reads static pattern strings during object initialization.",
  "targets": "The class methods operate on the regex object but do not interact with untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Pattern strings are stored internally and used to compile regex objects, with no data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that encapsulates regex compilation, providing copy and deepcopy methods. It relies solely on provided pattern strings and standard library functions. No external data inputs, network interactions, or sensitive data handling are involved. The purpose is to work around a known Python 2.6 bug; no malicious intent or suspicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility to enable copying regex objects in Python 2.6. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
