{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'textfsm' Python package, intended to configure and install the package including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (setuptools, textfsm, codecs, os), reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; package configuration uses static data and controlled inputs.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content as long_description; uses static package metadata; no flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated patterns detected. The code follows standard setup.py structure. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README file securely, and calls 'setup()' with static, well-defined parameters. It references a package 'textfsm' and sets up command-line entry points. The usage of static data and standard Python packaging practices suggest no malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
