  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks; no untrusted data is processed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the README file into the long_description variable, and module attributes are used to configure setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The script follows standard setup procedures.",
