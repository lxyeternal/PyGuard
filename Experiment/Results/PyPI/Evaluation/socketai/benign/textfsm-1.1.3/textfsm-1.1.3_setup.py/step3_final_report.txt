  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'textfsm' Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, imports 'textfsm' for version info, static package data and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from local files and package attributes to setup configuration; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with typical practices. The relative path '../testdata/*' in package_data is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured setup.py script for a Python package. It imports modules, reads local files, and calls setup() with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The version is obtained from the package itself, which is standard. The package data references a relative path, which could be a packaging concern but not security-related. All indicators point to a benign, legitimate package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code.",
