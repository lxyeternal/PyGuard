  "purpose": "Setup script for the textfsm Python module, used for parsing semi-structured text into tables.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long_description; imports textfsm module for version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are static or derived from trusted sources.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md to obtain long_description; uses static package and dependency information; references textfsm for versioning.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python module. It imports 'textfsm' for version info and reads a README file for description. The setup parameters are static and well-defined. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code adheres to typical packaging conventions and does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard, static, and does not perform any unsafe operations.",
