{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'textfsm' Python package, used to configure and install the package along with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, importing 'textfsm' for version info, and package data files.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Importing package, reading file for description, calling setup() with static parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily uses static configuration for package setup with no input validation, user data processing, or code execution. The only dynamic element is fetching the version from 'textfsm.__version__', which is standard and non-malicious. All data is statically defined or read from local files. No suspicious behaviors such as network access, command execution, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious actions.",
