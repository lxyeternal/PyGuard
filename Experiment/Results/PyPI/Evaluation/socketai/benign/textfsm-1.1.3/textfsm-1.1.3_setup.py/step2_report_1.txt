  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious activities are detected.\n- The code relies on static configuration, reading a README file, importing the package for version info, and setting up package metadata.\n- No untrusted data, dynamic code execution, network activity, or secrets are involved.\n- The package appears to be a legitimate open-source project maintained by Google.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The version is obtained via `textfsm.__version__`, which is standard practice.\n- The package data includes `'../testdata/*'`, which could be scrutinized for potential issues, but in a setup context, referencing relative paths is common and not inherently malicious.\n- Entry points and dependencies are typical and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious code or behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate. No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified given the absence of any security concerns.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or overestimations:**\n- All reports are consistent and conservative, which is appropriate for a standard setup script.\n- No reason to increase scores based on the provided code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The setup script is benign and follows best practices.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis. No modifications needed.",
