  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Behavior**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a standard `setup.py` script for the `textfsm` package. The code imports necessary modules, reads the README for description, and calls `setup()` with static, well-known parameters. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \nNo errors or logical flaws are evident. The code follows typical Python packaging conventions. The only minor note is that `package_data={'textfsm': ['../testdata/*']}` may not resolve correctly depending on the package structure, but this is not a security concern—more of a potential packaging issue.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities where none exist.\n   - They note that the version is obtained from `textfsm.__version__`, which is standard and safe.\n   - No untrusted data handling or external calls are present.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity or code present.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports**. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \nNo further action needed. The package appears safe based on this setup script.",
