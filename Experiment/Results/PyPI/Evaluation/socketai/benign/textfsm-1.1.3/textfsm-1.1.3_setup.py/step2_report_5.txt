  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for the 'textfsm' package.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious activities are identified.\n- The code reads a README file, imports the package to get version info, and calls setup() with static parameters.\n- No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted data is present.\n- The package data and dependencies are static and well-defined.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code appears legitimate and follows common Python packaging practices.\n- The only dynamic element is `version=textfsm.__version__`, which is standard for setup scripts.\n- The `package_data` includes `'../testdata/*'`, which could be a relative path outside the package directory, but this is a common pattern for including test data and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0.\n- This aligns with the analysis: no malicious or obfuscated code detected, and no security risks apparent.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Given the absence of any suspicious activity, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate.\n- The confidence level is high (1), which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the `'../testdata/*'` path in `package_data`. If the package is installed in a different directory, this relative path might not resolve correctly, but this is a packaging detail, not a security concern.\n- No claims or evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (standard setup script, no security risks)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, legitimate Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reported scores are accurate and should remain at zero.",
