  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file I/O, network calls, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, dynamic code execution points, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into functions like eval/exec, network requests, or data storage points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, obfuscation patterns, inconsistent code structure, incomplete code sections.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 shows benign code with no suspicious patterns, justified by low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 2 contains indicators such as eval/exec, suspicious URLs, and hardcoded credentials, warranting higher scores (malware=0.6, obfuscated=0.6, securityRisk=0.6). Report 3 and 5 are straightforward utility or data processing scripts with no suspicious activity, scores at zero or minimal. Report 4 lacks code but is cautiously scored low due to incomplete information. The suspicious patterns in Report 2 justify increased malware and obfuscation scores, aligning with typical malicious indicators. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described code behaviors, with Report 2 being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, with Report 2 showing signs of obfuscation and malicious patterns, justifying higher malware and security risk scores. The assessments are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Slightly increasing the malware score for Report 2 to 0.6 enhances accuracy. Overall, the code review indicates low to moderate risk, with specific suspicion in Report 2.",
