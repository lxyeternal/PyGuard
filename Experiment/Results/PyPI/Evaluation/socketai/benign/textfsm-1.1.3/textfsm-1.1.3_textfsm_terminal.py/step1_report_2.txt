{
  "purpose": "Provides terminal-related routines including ANSI escape sequences, terminal size detection, line wrapping, and a pager interface for displaying text in the terminal.",
  "sources": "Reads input from stdin or specified files, reads user key presses via terminal (tty) device, retrieves terminal size via os.environ or ioctl on tty device.",
  "sinks": "Outputs text and ANSI sequences to stdout, reads user keystrokes from tty or stdin, reads files specified as command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from files or stdin to the Pager's Page() method, user keystrokes flow from _GetCh() to _AskUser(), output (including ANSI codes) flows to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; code uses standard libraries and handles missing modules gracefully. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed. The pager implementation is typical and does not include any hidden or malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The script is a terminal utility providing ANSI formatting, terminal size detection, line wrapping, and a pager interface. It imports standard modules with exception handling to support multiple platforms. The functions handle terminal output formatting and user interaction securely within the scope of terminal I/O. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior are present. The code's logic and flow are consistent with a benign terminal utility, and there are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal utility for text display and user interaction, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions as expected for a pager-like interface with ANSI support, and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.",
