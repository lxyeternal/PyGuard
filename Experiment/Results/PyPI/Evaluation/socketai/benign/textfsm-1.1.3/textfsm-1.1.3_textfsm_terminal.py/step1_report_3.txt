{
  "purpose": "The code provides terminal utility functions for ANSI escape sequences, terminal size detection, line wrapping, and a simple text pager for displaying large texts on the terminal.",
  "sources": "Data is read from files specified via command line arguments or standard input.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout for displaying paged text and ANSI escape sequences; reading terminal input for user commands.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from file or stdin to the Pager for display; user input is captured from the terminal to control paging; terminal size information is read for formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard modules and safe practices for terminal I/O; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a terminal utility for displaying large texts with pagination and ANSI styling. It uses standard libraries and handles user input for navigation. No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity, are present. The code appears to be well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious code sections. The only external interactions are reading from files or stdin and writing to stdout, consistent with terminal utilities. There are no hidden backdoors, malicious code, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal utility module for displaying text with styling and pagination. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided code, and it performs expected functions without malicious intent.",
