{
  "purpose": "The code provides terminal utilities for text styling, line wrapping, terminal size detection, and paging through text interactively.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments, stdin, environment variables, and user keystrokes from /dev/tty or stdin.",
  "sinks": "Outputs styled text to stdout, reads user input for paging control, and accesses environment variables for terminal size.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (stdin, files, environment) through processing functions, with user interactions controlling paging behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments; standard library usage with fallback handling.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward terminal utility module implementing ANSI escape sequences, terminal size detection, line wrapping, and an interactive pager. It employs standard libraries and practices, handles cross-platform considerations, and does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications. The code structure is clear, and no suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of /dev/tty for user input is typical for terminal applications. No obfuscation or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured terminal utility library with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments in the provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
