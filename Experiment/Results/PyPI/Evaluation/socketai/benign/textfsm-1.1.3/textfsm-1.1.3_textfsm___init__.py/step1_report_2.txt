{
  "purpose": "To provide a text parsing utility that converts human-readable command output into structured data using a template language.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'textfsm.parser' module, which may involve external code execution depending on how 'textfsm.parser' is implemented.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports from 'textfsm.parser' could potentially execute code if 'textfsm.parser' is malicious or compromised, but no such execution is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code is straightforward and appears to only import a module and define a version.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a docstring describing the module's purpose, an import statement from a third-party library, and a version string. There are no indications of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. The import depends on 'textfsm.parser', which could be malicious if compromised, but that is external to this code snippet. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup for a text parsing utility. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks itself, but it relies on an external library that could potentially be malicious if compromised. Overall, the code is safe based on this snippet.",
