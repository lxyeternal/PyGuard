  "purpose": "To implement a template-based text parser for converting human-readable text into structured data records.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing everything from textfsm.parser",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; the code only imports a module",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input or output; the code is solely import-based",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module documentation and import statement. It defines a version number and imports from a third-party library. There are no dynamic code execution, data processing, or other suspicious activities. The imported library 'textfsm.parser' is a known package for parsing templates, and nothing indicates malicious behavior. The code's structure and content are minimal and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, containing only documentation, version declaration, and a safe import statement. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are present.",
