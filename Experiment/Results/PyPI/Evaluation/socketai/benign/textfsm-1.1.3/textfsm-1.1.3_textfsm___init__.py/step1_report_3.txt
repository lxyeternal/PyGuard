  "purpose": "To provide a template-based text parser for converting human-readable text into structured data records.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'parser' module from the 'textfsm' package.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Import of 'textfsm.parser' is straightforward; no data flow analysis is applicable as there is no execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a parser module from a known open-source package 'textfsm' and defines a version string. No malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The purpose is clearly documented, and the code is simple. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or data leaks are detected. The package appears to be a standard component for text parsing with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, straightforward module that serves as a template for a text parser. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks present. It appears to be a legitimate part of an open-source parsing utility.",
