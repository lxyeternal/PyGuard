{
  "purpose": "This module implements a text parser using a template-based approach, converting human-readable text into structured data records.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'parser' from the 'textfsm' library, which is an external dependency that provides parsing functionality.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; it does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "The code imports external library functionality; no internal data flow or processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, mainly a docstring and an import statement. There are no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module for text parsing with descriptive comments and imports a parser class from the 'textfsm' library. The code structure is standard and does not perform any operations that could be malicious. No data processing, input handling, or external communication occurs within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple template for a text parser, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is a straightforward import and documentation module.",
