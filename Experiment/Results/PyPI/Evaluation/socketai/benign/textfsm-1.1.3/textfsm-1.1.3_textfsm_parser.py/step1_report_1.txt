{
  "purpose": "This code implements a template-based text parser using a finite state machine (FSM) to convert human-readable text into structured data, primarily for command output parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files specified via command-line arguments, including template files and CLI output examples. Also reads template and input files for parsing.",
  "sinks": "Outputs parsed results to standard output; no explicit data sinks such as network connections or file writes other than input/output files; no code executes external commands or writes sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Reads template files -> parses and constructs FSM -> reads input text -> processes input through FSM -> outputs parsed data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code segments detected. The code strictly adheres to template parsing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of a text parsing FSM with clear separation of concerns, error handling, and modular design. It does not include any network operations, system modifications, or malicious behaviors. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. It processes files provided as input, uses regex for parsing, and outputs results locally. No external code or dependencies appear to perform harmful actions beyond expected parsing logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, open-source style text parsing utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It functions solely as a template-driven FSM parser for command output. No malware or security risks are identified based on the code provided.",
