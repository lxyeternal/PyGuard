{
  "purpose": "This code implements a template-based text parser using a finite state machine (FSM) to convert human-readable text into structured data, mainly for parsing command output from network devices.",
  "sources": "Reads input from files specified via command line arguments; reads template definitions; reads CLI output text; reads optional reference output file.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes parsed data to standard output; no other sinks such as network or file writes are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads template file -> Parses FSM structure -> Processes input text through FSM -> Outputs parsed table or comparison result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code primarily performs parsing operations. The use of 'sys.argv' for command line input is standard; no obfuscated or unusual code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a well-structured FSM-based parser for converting text based on user-defined templates. It carefully handles template parsing, state transitions, and data extraction. Error handling is implemented via custom exceptions. The code does not contain any suspicious imports beyond standard libraries and 'six' for compatibility. No indications of malicious code such as network activity, hidden backdoors, or data theft. The initial comments and licensing information are standard and unrelated to malicious intent. No suspicious anomalies or obfuscated code are detected. The command line interface is straightforward for parsing templates and input files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, open-source FSM parser for text processing with no signs of malicious behavior. It functions solely for parsing and validating structured text, with no indicators of malware or malicious supply chain compromise.",
