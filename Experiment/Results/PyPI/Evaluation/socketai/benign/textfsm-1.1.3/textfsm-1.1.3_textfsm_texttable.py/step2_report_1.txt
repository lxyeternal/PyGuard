  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate tabular data utility, handling CSV parsing, display, sorting, filtering, and row/column operations. No external sources or network activity, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation. The confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code appears standard, with no malicious patterns or suspicious behavior. The analysis correctly notes the absence of external or untrusted code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard CSV reading, data manipulation, and formatting. No network or external effects, no dynamic code, no obfuscation. High confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1. The reasoning is appropriate; the code is a typical data handling module with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard CSV parsing and table formatting module. No network, no code injection, no obfuscation. High confidence (0.95), malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard table handling, CSV parsing, no external or malicious effects. High confidence (0.95), malware 0, risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with previous reports; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with prior assessments—no external effects, no malicious code, standard data handling, no obfuscation. Confidence 0.95, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### **My own evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — standard utility code, minimal attack surface, no external interactions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured utility for tabular data manipulation with no signs of supply chain or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's functionality.",
