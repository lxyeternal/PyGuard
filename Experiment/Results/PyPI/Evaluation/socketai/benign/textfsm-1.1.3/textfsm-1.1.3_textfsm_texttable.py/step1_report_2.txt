{
  "purpose": "This module provides classes and functions to manipulate and display tabular text data, including reading from CSV, sorting, filtering, and formatting tables.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input buffers in CsvToTable(), and accesses internal attributes of table and row objects, especially in methods like CsvToTable(), Append(), and property getters/setters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs via __str__, FormattedTable(), or CsvToTable(). No explicit data leaks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input buffers into table rows via CsvToTable(), then through various methods that modify or retrieve data, such as Append(), Filter(), Map(), and formatting functions like FormattedTable().",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code primarily manipulates data structures and formats output. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for handling tabular data, including reading CSV, sorting, filtering, extending, and formatting. It uses common Python patterns and libraries. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or privacy violations evident. All methods operate on provided data, with no external calls or data exfiltration. The code appears consistent with legitimate data handling functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of tabular data manipulation and formatting. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It is safe for use from a security perspective.",
