{
  "purpose": "To provide character encoding detection functionality using the cchardet library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters in functions 'detect' and 'feed', and from properties accessing 'self._detector.result'.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data internally and returns results; no direct data leakage or external effect points are present.",
  "flows": "Input data ('msg' in 'detect' and 'data' in 'feed') flows into the cchardet detection functions, and results are returned as dictionaries. No external sinks or network operations are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are observed. The code is straightforward and relies on an external library.",
  "analysis": "The script imports cchardet, a third-party encoding detection library, and defines functions and classes that wrap its detection methods. The 'detect' function calls '_cchardet.detect_with_confidence' on input data, decoding byte results to strings. The 'UniversalDetector' class wraps '_cchardet.UniversalDetector', exposing methods for feeding data, resetting, closing, and retrieving detection results. All operations are confined to data processing with no suspicious code behavior, no network operations, no data leaks, and no backdoors. The code appears to be a standard wrapper around cchardet's API.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, straightforward wrapper around the cchardet library for encoding detection. It performs no malicious actions or suspicious behaviors. The code is benign and does not pose security threats.",
