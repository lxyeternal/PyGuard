{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes for detecting character encoding of a given message using the cchardet library.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'msg' parameter in detect() and 'data' parameter in feed() method.",
  "sinks": "Returns detection results as a dictionary; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (msg or data) flows into cchardet detection functions, with results processed and returned as structured data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No indirect or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a private module '_cchardet' from 'cchardet', and a version string. It defines a detection function that calls a detection method on input string, handling bytes decoding. The UniversalDetector class wraps cchardet's detector, providing context management, reset, feed, close, and property methods. All operations rely on cchardet's standard API; no external or malicious actions are performed. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward utility for character encoding detection using cchardet, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The implementation is standard, with safe data handling practices. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
