  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured wrapper around a third-party encoding detection library. There is no malicious, suspicious, or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on an external library, which is standard practice. The scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence."
