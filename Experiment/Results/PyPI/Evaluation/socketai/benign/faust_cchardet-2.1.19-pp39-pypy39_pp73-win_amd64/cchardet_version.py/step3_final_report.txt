{
  "purpose": "This code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a package version indicator in Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a static assignment of a string value.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the assignment is a simple static operation with no source-to-sink data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard practice in Python for defining a package's version. It involves a single string assignment with no inputs, outputs, or logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns, and the confidence in benignity is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. All reports accurately reflect this, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
