  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version declaration with a static string. There are no inputs, no outputs, no function calls, and no data processing. No obfuscated code, no credentials, or other suspicious patterns are present. This is standard practice for package versioning in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply defining a version number. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk evident.",
