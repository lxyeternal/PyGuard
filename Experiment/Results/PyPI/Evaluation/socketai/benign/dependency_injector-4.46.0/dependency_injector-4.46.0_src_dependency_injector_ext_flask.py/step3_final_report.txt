  "purpose": "Provides dependency injection providers for Flask applications, wrapping Flask request object and facilitating view creation via dependency_injector.",
  "sources": "Reads from flask_request object and provider configurations; no external untrusted input processing.",
  "sinks": "Creates view functions via as_view(), invoking provider methods; no untrusted data flows into critical sinks.",
  "flows": "Provider objects are transformed into view functions; no data leaks or malicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard patterns, and contains no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask extension leveraging dependency_injector for app components and views. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. The deprecation warning is benign. The view creation functions invoke provider methods safely, with no untrusted data processed in a harmful manner. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The existing assessments are accurate; no modifications needed.",
