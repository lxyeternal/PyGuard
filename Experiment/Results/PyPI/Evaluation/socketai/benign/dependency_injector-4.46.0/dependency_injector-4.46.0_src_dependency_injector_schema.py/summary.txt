  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate dependency injection framework that uses dynamic import and reflection, which can be exploited if schema data is untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary concern is ensuring schema data is validated to prevent remote code execution. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation at 0, and a high security risk score due to the reflection-based dynamic execution pathways."
