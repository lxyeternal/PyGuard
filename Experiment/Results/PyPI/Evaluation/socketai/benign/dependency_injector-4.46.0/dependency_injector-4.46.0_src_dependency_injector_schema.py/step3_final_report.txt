  "purpose": "Dependency injection schema processing and provider instantiation based on schema data.",
  "sources": "Schema data strings specifying provider classes, arguments, and provides fields.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import via _import_string, getattr calls, provider instantiation, set_provides, add_args, add_kwargs.",
  "flows": "Schema data -> _import_string / getattr -> provider class -> instantiation -> set_provides / add_args / add_kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and getattr with untrusted input, commented-out code for 'provides' import, no validation of schema data.",
  "analysis": "The code relies heavily on dynamic import and attribute access based on schema strings, which can lead to remote code execution if schema data is malicious. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The reflection mechanisms are standard but pose security risks if inputs are untrusted. The malware score is 0, as no malicious payloads or backdoors are detected. The obfuscation score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is high (around 0.6-0.75), justified by the potential for code injection via untrusted schema data. Proper validation of schema inputs is essential to mitigate these risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate dependency injection framework that uses dynamic import and reflection, which can be exploited if schema data is untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary concern is ensuring schema data is validated to prevent remote code execution. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation at 0, and a high security risk score due to the reflection-based dynamic execution pathways.",
