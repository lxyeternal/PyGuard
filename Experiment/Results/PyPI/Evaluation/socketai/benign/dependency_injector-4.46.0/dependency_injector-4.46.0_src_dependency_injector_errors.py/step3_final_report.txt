{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes related to dependency injection errors, serving as error handling mechanisms within a larger dependency injection framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from class instantiations and attribute assignments, primarily during error handling and exception raising.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include error message outputs or logs that may inadvertently expose sensitive information if error details are not sanitized. However, in this code, error messages are generic and do not leak sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves raising specific exceptions during dependency injection failures, with data flowing from the point of error detection to exception instantiation and message generation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with clear class definitions and no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a base error class and specialized subclasses for specific dependency injection errors. The 'NonCopyableArgumentError' stores context attributes and provides a custom string representation. There are no network operations, data leaks, or dynamic code execution. The code is clean, well-structured, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. The error messages are generic, reducing risk of information leakage. Overall, the code appears benign with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of custom exception classes for dependency injection error handling. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are empty, providing no additional insights, but based on the code alone, the security risk is negligible and malware likelihood is zero.",
