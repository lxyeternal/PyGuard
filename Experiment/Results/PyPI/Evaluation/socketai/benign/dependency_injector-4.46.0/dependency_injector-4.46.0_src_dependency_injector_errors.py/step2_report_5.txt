  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n\n- The code defines a set of custom exception classes related to dependency injection errors.\n- The classes appear straightforward, with `NonCopyableArgumentError` storing relevant context and providing a custom `__str__` method.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- The code seems clean, with no obvious vulnerabilities or suspicious logic.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n\n- All reports show `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with no `raw_response` content.\n- This indicates that the reports are either incomplete or not providing any meaningful details about potential issues.\n- Without detailed report content, it's impossible to identify specific vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or logical flaws.\n\n3. **Evaluation of the Scores:**\n\n- Since the reports contain no detailed information, any risk, malware, or obfuscation scores assigned are likely based on assumptions rather than evidence.\n- The malware score should be 0 unless there's evidence of malicious activity, which there isn't.\n- The risk score should be low (near 0) because no issues are described.\n- The obfuscated score should also be 0, as there's no indication of obfuscation.\n\n4. **Potential Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**\n\n- The main flaw is the lack of detailed information in the reports. This makes any assessment speculative.\n- The reports should include actual findings, code snippets, or descriptions to enable proper evaluation.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Recommendations:**\n\n- Based on the available data, **the scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should all be 0**.\n- The reports are incomplete; they do not provide enough information to justify higher scores.\n- If these reports are meant to flag issues, they need to include specific details.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code appears benign and well-structured.\n- **Errors or flaws in the report:** The reports are empty and lack detail.\n- **Scores:** Should be all zero (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0).\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or risk based on the provided reports.\n\n**Overall, I recommend disregarding the current scores due to insufficient data and setting all to zero until more detailed reports are available.**",
