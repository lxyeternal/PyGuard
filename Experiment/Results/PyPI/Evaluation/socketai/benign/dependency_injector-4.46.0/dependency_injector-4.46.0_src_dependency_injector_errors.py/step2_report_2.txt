  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Security Implications:**\n   - The code defines custom exception classes related to dependency injection errors.\n   - There are no embedded malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n   - The code is straightforward and primarily for error handling.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code appears clean, with proper inheritance and descriptive docstrings.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious behavior are evident.\n   - The only potential concern could be if error messages leak sensitive information, but here they are generic and do not seem to do so.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports contain only \"Empty response\" messages with no additional details.\n   - Without further context or raw responses, it's impossible to determine if there are issues or malicious activity.\n   - The reports seem to be placeholders or incomplete, not providing actionable information.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - Since the reports are empty and provide no evidence of issues, the malware score should be 0.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be 0, as there's no obfuscation present.\n   - The risk score should be minimal, likely 0 or close to it, given the lack of evidence.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious activity can be made based on empty responses.\n   - It’s important to request more detailed reports or raw responses to properly assess any risks.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code itself is benign.\n   - The reports are incomplete, providing no evidence of issues.\n   - Based on the available information, the security risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should all be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: **0**\n  - Obfuscated: **0**\n  - Risk: **0**\n\n- **Additional steps:**\n  - Request more detailed reports or raw responses to perform a thorough analysis.\n  - Verify if the reports are correctly generated or if there's an issue with the reporting system.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe and free of malicious content. The reports are empty and do not indicate any issues. Therefore, all scores should be zero, reflecting no risk or malicious activity.",
