  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no raw response or details.\n- Since no specific issues, vulnerabilities, or anomalies are described, I cannot confirm any actual problems in the code based on these reports.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues are explicitly reported or evidenced in the code snippet.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary**\n\n- The reports are empty, providing no details about the nature of the problem.\n- Without descriptive responses, it's impossible to verify or refute any claims.\n- The reports lack context, making their validity or relevance questionable.\n- **Conclusion:** The reports are invalid or incomplete; they do not contain actionable information.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores and suggest changes**\n\n- No scores are provided, only \"Empty response\" messages.\n- Without scores, I cannot evaluate their reasonableness or suggest modifications.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since no issues are identified, and the reports lack details, there is no basis for assigning any risk score, especially high ones.\n- **Conclusion:** Risk scores should be minimal or zero unless further information suggests otherwise.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n- The code appears to be standard exception class definitions for dependency injection errors.\n- No malicious behavior or malware indications are present.\n- The reports do not suggest any malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should be zero.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports do not provide any claims or assumptions, only empty responses.\n- Without additional context, I cannot challenge or validate any supposed vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- No scores are provided, so consistency cannot be assessed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code review:** The code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes. No issues are evident.\n- **Report validity:** The reports are empty, providing no useful information.\n- **Scores:** Cannot be assigned meaningfully due to lack of data, but in absence of issues, they should be minimal.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no issues reported or confirmed)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nGiven the complete lack of detailed responses and the straightforward nature of the code, there is no evidence of vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are incomplete or invalid, and thus, the risk remains negligible.\n\n**Final note:** For a more accurate assessment, detailed reports with specific issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior are necessary.",
