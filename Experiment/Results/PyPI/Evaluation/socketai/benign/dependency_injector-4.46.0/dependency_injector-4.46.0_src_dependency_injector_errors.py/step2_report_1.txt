  "review": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a straightforward set of custom exception classes related to dependency injection errors.\n   - There are no indications of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities within this code snippet.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution that could be exploited.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports contain only \"Empty response\" messages with no raw response content.\n   - Without additional details, there's no evidence of a security incident or suspicious activity.\n   - The absence of details makes it impossible to verify if the reports are valid or if they reference issues within this code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - Since no specific scores are provided in the reports, I cannot evaluate their reasonableness.\n   - Given the lack of detailed information, any high scores would be unjustified.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - The code itself does not exhibit any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n   - Malware score should be very low or zero.\n   - Risk score should also be minimal unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made in the reports, only \"Empty response.\"\n   - Without additional context, it's unreasonable to assume any vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - Not applicable here due to lack of score data.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code appears benign and free of vulnerabilities or malware.\n- The reports lack content, so no issues can be confirmed.\n- Any suspicion of a security incident based solely on \"Empty response\" reports is unfounded.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Without further details, I would assign:\n  - **Malware score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n  - **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are empty, so no further analysis is possible. No changes to scores are warranted at this time.",
