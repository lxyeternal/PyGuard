{
  "purpose": "Define a Lifespan handler class for managing resource initialization and shutdown in a Starlette application, utilizing dependency injection containers.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, typing, typing_extensions, dependency_injector.containers, and standard Python modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present; the code does not perform any network I/O, file I/O, or data leakage operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly manages resource lifecycle within a container.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Usage of conditional import based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class Lifespan that manages resource lifecycle via dependency_injector. It uses standard Python features, conditional imports for compatibility, and standard async context management. No external data input, no data exfiltration, no network activity, and no code injection mechanisms are present. The class is intended for resource management in web applications and does not perform any malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate resource management utility for a Starlette application using dependency injection. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It is safe based on the provided code.",
