{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Lifespan handler class for Starlette applications, managing resource initialization and shutdown via a dependency injection container.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, dependency_injector, starlette, and typing_extensions; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Methods calling container.init_resources() and container.shutdown_resources(); these are controlled calls to container methods with no direct data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external inputs to sensitive functions; the code initializes and shuts down resources through the container, which is supplied during object construction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of conditional import based on Python version is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a resource management class for Starlette apps, relying on dependency_injector for resource lifecycle. It includes version-dependent imports, class initialization, and async context management methods. No input/output or data processing from untrusted sources. The container is injected and used solely for resource handling. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate resource management utility for web applications, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard patterns and libraries for dependency injection and resource lifecycle management.",
