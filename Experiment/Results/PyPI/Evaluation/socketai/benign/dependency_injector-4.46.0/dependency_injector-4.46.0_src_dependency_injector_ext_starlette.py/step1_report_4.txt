{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Lifespan class for managing resource initialization and shutdown within a Starlette application using dependency injection.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, dependency_injector.containers, and typing_extensions; the constructor and methods of the Lifespan class.",
  "sinks": "Calling init_resources() and shutdown_resources() on the container, and awaiting their results.",
  "flows": "Constructor assigns container; __call__ returns self; __aenter__ calls init_resources and awaits; __aexit__ calls shutdown_resources and awaits.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed. Usage of standard lifecycle methods and dependency injection appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a lifecycle handler for a web framework, utilizing dependency injection to manage resources. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code relies on well-known libraries and performs resource management functions only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate resource management component for a Starlette application, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
