  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard implementation of a resource lifecycle handler for Starlette applications, utilizing dependency_injector.\n- They confirm that the code performs resource initialization and shutdown via container methods (`init_resources()` and `shutdown_resources()`), with no data flow from untrusted sources.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign very high confidence (0.9 to 1.0) that the code is legitimate and free of malicious intent.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1), indicating minimal concern, mainly due to the potential for container methods to execute code, but no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are identified in the code. It is a clean, standard pattern for resource management.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are apparent. The code correctly implements async context management and dependency injection patterns.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are consistent; no flawed reasoning or suspicious claims are present.\n- The container's `init_resources()` and `shutdown_resources()` are called in a typical manner, with no indication of malicious code within this snippet.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** The scores are uniformly low (0.1), justified by the fact that the container methods could theoretically execute arbitrary code, but there's no evidence of such here.\n\n### Potential Assumptions and Challenges:\n- The reports assume that container methods are safe, which is reasonable given they are standard library calls.\n- No claims are based on unfounded assumptions; all findings are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical resource lifecycle handler with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The container's methods (`init_resources()` and `shutdown_resources()`) are external, but their invocation here is safe and standard.\n- The overall security posture is very good; no significant risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to potential container method execution, but no actual risk demonstrated)\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured resource management utility for Starlette applications, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores accurately reflect the low threat level.",
