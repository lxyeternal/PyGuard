  "purpose": "Defines a Lifespan handler class for managing container resource initialization and shutdown in a Starlette application.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, dependency_injector.containers.Container, container parameter, sys, typing, dependency_injector.ext.starlette.Lifespan",
  "sinks": "Methods that invoke container.init_resources() and container.shutdown_resources()",
  "flows": "Container is passed to Lifespan, which uses it during application lifespan events (enter and exit) to initialize and shut down resources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. Uses standard library and dependency_injector features appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a lifecycle handler for a dependency injection container in a web application context. It conditionally imports typing extensions based on Python version, manages container resource lifecycle with init and shutdown calls, and implements async context manager protocols. No signs of data leakage, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate resource management utility for Starlette applications using dependency_injector. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
