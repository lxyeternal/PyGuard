  "purpose": "Resource lifecycle management for a Starlette application using dependency_injector containers.",
  "sources": "Container's init_resources() and shutdown_resources() methods invoked during application startup and shutdown.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Container methods called during __aenter__ and __aexit__, managing resources without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an async context manager for resource initialization and shutdown, utilizing dependency_injector. It conditionally imports typing extensions, defines a Lifespan class with container attribute, and manages resources via container methods. No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code follows standard patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The container methods are external but invoked safely within the lifecycle hooks. All signals indicate benign, well-structured code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard resource lifecycle handler for Starlette applications, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
