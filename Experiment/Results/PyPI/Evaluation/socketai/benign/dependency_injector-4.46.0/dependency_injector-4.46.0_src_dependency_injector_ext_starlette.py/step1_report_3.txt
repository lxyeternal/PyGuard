{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Lifespan handler class for managing resource initialization and shutdown within a Starlette application, utilizing dependency injection containers.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and dependency_injector libraries; class methods accessing container's init_resources and shutdown_resources.",
  "sinks": "Calling container methods init_resources and shutdown_resources, which could potentially execute code within those methods.",
  "flows": "The Lifespan class is instantiated with a container, and its call method is used within an app context, leading to potential invocation of container's resource methods during app startup/shutdown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code indicators. The container's resource methods are invoked in an expected manner.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a lifecycle handler for a web application, utilizing dependency injection for resource management. It conditionally imports typing extensions based on Python version, and defines an asynchronous context manager to initialize and shut down resources via container methods. No code injection, malicious behaviors, or security-sensitive anomalies are present. The use of dependency_injector is standard for managing dependencies, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, legitimate implementation of a resource management lifecycle handler for a web app. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, and poses no evident security threats.",
