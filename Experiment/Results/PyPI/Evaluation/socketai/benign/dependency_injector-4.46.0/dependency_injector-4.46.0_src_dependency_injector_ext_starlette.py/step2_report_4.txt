  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's security implications, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of a resource lifecycle handler for a Starlette application, utilizing dependency_injector for resource management.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The container's methods (`init_resources()` and `shutdown_resources()`) are invoked during application startup and shutdown, which is standard practice.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n- The code uses standard libraries and patterns, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The logic is correct, and the code performs expected resource management functions.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or flaws are evident.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** No malware or malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation.\n- **Security risks:** The overall security risk is minimal, primarily because the code only manages resources via well-known container methods.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\n- The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, as the code is clear.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The risk scores are set at 0.1 in most reports, which is acceptable given the code's nature, but since the code is purely resource management with no external inputs or outputs, a risk score of 0 or 0.05 could be more appropriate. However, 0.1 is reasonable for a minimal risk.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n\n- None of the reports justify a risk score higher than 0.5; all are very low.\n- Malware scores are zero, which is justified given the absence of malicious activity.\n\n### Consistency check:\n\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- No contradictions or suspicious claims.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 to 0.1 (minimal risk, standard resource management code)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a resource lifecycle handler for Starlette applications, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe, with no malicious intent.\n- The current scores are appropriate, but could be slightly lowered to reflect the minimal risk more accurately.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with a slight note that risk could be considered as 0 or 0.05 for even lower risk.",
