  "purpose": "Setup script for compiling Cython extensions with optional debugging features.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DEPENDENCY_INJECTOR_DEBUG_MODE', file paths 'src/**/*.pyx'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Environment variable affects compiler directives; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The code primarily configures Cython compilation.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up Cython compilation with optional debugging based on an environment variable. It uses standard libraries and well-known tools (setuptools, Cython). There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The environment variable controls debugging features; this is typical for development, not malicious behavior. No suspicious code paths or obfuscation are present. The extension source paths are broad ('src/**/*.pyx'), but this does not indicate malicious intent—just a pattern for source files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build configuration script for Cython modules, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely conditionally enables debugging options during compilation. There are no anomalies or suspicious activities detected.",
