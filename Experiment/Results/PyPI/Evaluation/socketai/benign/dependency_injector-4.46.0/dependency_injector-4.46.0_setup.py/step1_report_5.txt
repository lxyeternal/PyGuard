  "purpose": "Setup script for compiling Cython extensions with optional debugging features.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DEPENDENCY_INJECTOR_DEBUG_MODE'; files matching 'src/**/*.pyx' during cythonize.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leakage.",
  "flows": "Environment variable determines debugging macros; these macros influence Cython compilation but do not affect runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; use of environment variables to toggle debugging features is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up Cython compilation with optional debugging based on an environment variable. It defines macros for tracing and profiling if debug mode is enabled. The setup function compiles all '.pyx' files under 'src/' directory. There are no dynamic code executions, no data leaks, no hardcoded secrets, or network activity. The code is straightforward build configuration code with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a typical build setup for Cython extensions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
