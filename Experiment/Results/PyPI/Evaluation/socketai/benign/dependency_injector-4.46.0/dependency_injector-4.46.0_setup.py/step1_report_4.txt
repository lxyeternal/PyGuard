  "purpose": "Setup script for compiling Cython extensions for the dependency injector project.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DEPENDENCY_INJECTOR_DEBUG_MODE', file paths in 'src/**/*.pyx'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent data sinks or untrusted data outputs; primarily configuration and build steps.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'DEPENDENCY_INJECTOR_DEBUG_MODE' influences build macros and directives.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. Use of wildcard '*' in Extension could be considered unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script reads an environment variable to set debug mode, configures Cython compilation options accordingly, and defines macros for tracing if debug mode is enabled. It then invokes cythonize on source files with specified directives. There are no external data leaks, suspicious network calls, or backdoors. The code primarily handles build configuration without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build setup script for Cython extensions with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
