  "purpose": "Standard setup script for building Cython extensions with optional debugging features controlled via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DEPENDENCY_INJECTOR_DEBUG_MODE' for toggling debug macros; broad source path 'src/**/*.pyx' for Cython source files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network or external data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences macro definitions; macros affect compilation directives; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad wildcard in source files ('src/**/*.pyx') is typical but could include unintended files; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional build setup for Cython extensions, employing environment variables for debugging, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of macros and source patterns aligns with standard practices. No external data flows or network activities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard build configuration script with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scoring is appropriate.",
