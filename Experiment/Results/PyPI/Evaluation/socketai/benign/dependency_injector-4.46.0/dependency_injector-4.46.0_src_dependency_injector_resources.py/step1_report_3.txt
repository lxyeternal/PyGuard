  "purpose": "Definition of generic resource management classes with abstract methods for initialization and shutdown.",
  "sources": "Import statements (abc, typing), class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; abstract methods have no implementation here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two generic abstract classes for resource management, one synchronous and one asynchronous. It employs standard Python features like abc for abstract base classes and typing for generics. There are no code injections, malicious behaviors, or security-sensitive operations within this snippet. The methods are abstract and meant to be implemented elsewhere, and the code does not perform any data processing or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign definition of resource management classes with no malicious intent or security issues.",
