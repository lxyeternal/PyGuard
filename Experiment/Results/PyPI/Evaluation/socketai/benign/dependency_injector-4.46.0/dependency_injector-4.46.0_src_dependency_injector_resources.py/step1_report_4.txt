{
  "purpose": "Define generic resource management classes with asynchronous and synchronous initialization and shutdown methods.",
  "sources": "No external data input; class and method definitions are static and do not read untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or execute untrusted data or perform network/file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines abstract classes for resource management.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes abstract base classes for resource handling using generics, ABCMeta, and abstract methods. It includes both synchronous and asynchronous resource management methods, but contains no actual implementation, data processing, or external calls. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a straightforward framework for resource lifecycle management.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, benign framework for resource management with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not process untrusted input or perform any actions that could be exploited maliciously.",
