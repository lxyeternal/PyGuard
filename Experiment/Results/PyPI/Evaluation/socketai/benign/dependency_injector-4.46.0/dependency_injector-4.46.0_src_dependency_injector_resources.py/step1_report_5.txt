{
  "purpose": "Defines generic abstract resource classes for synchronous and asynchronous resource management.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; class method parameters may accept data at runtime, but no specific sources are hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or sensitive information leakage observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class methods are abstract and intended for extension, with no implementation shown.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains standard class definitions with abstract methods; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines generic resource management classes using Python's abc module and typing, facilitating resource initialization and shutdown. No external data sources, no sensitive data handling, and no dynamic code execution or network activity are present. The structure is standard and appears intended for modular resource handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of resource management classes with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended for extension in larger projects.",
