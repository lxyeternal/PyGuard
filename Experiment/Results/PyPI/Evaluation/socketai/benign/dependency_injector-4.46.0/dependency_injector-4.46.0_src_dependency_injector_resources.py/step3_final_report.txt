{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract base classes for resource management, providing synchronous and asynchronous interfaces for initialization and shutdown procedures.",
  "sources": "The abstract methods 'init' which accept *args and **kwargs, intended to be implemented by subclasses.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data outputs; the code does not process untrusted input or perform external calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to subclass implementations of 'init' and 'shutdown'; no actual data flow occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, uses standard Python idioms, and contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two abstract classes with abstract 'init' methods and optional 'shutdown' methods, designed for extension. It employs standard modules 'abc' and 'typing', with no data processing, external interactions, or security-sensitive operations. The absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code indicates a benign purpose. All signals point to a structural framework for resource management, with no malicious or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard abstraction layer for resource management with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
