{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for resource management with synchronous and asynchronous init and shutdown methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method parameters (*args, **kwargs) during init methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exfiltrated.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; method parameters are standard for abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes generic abstract classes for resource handling, utilizing Python's abc module and type hints. It defines a Resource class and an AsyncResource class, both with abstract init methods and optional shutdown methods. There are no suspicious function calls, data processing, or external interactions. The use of *args and **kwargs is typical for flexible initialization and does not indicate malicious intent. No external inputs or outputs are directly handled here, and the code does not include any network or system operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, harmless abstraction layer for resource management. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
