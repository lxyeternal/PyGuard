{
  "purpose": "Define abstract generic resource management classes with initialization and shutdown methods for synchronous and asynchronous use.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present; the code does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines class structures and abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two abstract generic classes, Resource and AsyncResource, each with abstract methods for init and optional shutdown, designed for resource management. There are no input points, data processing, or external calls. The code strictly adheres to standard Python class and type annotations without any suspicious constructs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward template for resource management classes. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears safe and typical for interface definitions in Python.",
