  "purpose": "This module provides dependency injection, module wiring, and auto-loading functionalities for Python applications, particularly for frameworks like FastAPI and Starlette. It manages container providers, patches functions/classes for injection, and handles module loading hooks.",
  "sources": "Code reads modules, classes, functions, and their members through inspect.getmembers and related reflection methods. It also reads environment variables indirectly via imported modules (e.g., fastapi, starlette, werkzeug) and uses importlib to load modules dynamically.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include setattr for injecting dependencies into class attributes or modules, and dynamic function patching for injection purposes. It modifies functions, classes, and module attributes to embed dependency injection logic.",
  "flows": "Sources (module and class members) flow into functions that patch or unpatch code, injecting or removing dependency injection wrappers. The injection functions modify attributes, functions, and class methods via setattr, potentially affecting runtime behavior. Dynamic import and module loading can also be flows if malicious code is loaded via importlib.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code dynamically patches functions and classes for dependency injection, which is a legitimate pattern but could be misused if dependencies or modules are maliciously injected. The presence of module import hooks and dynamic patching could be exploited for malicious injection if malicious modules are loaded. No obfuscated code or suspicious language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements dependency injection, module wiring, and auto-loading features. It uses reflection and dynamic module importing to inject dependencies into functions, classes, and modules. It does not contain any suspicious hard-coded secrets or malicious commands. The module patches functions and class methods to inject dependencies, which is a common pattern in dependency injection frameworks. The use of import hooks for module loading is standard, but if an attacker controls the modules or containers, they could execute malicious code during import. No evidence of hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity was found. The code is complex but appears to be a legitimate DI framework with potential misuse if dependencies or modules are compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a dependency injection and module auto-loading framework. No malicious behavior or malware signals are evident. The use of dynamic patching and module import hooks could be misused if compromised modules are introduced, but the code itself does not contain malicious intent or dangerous operations. The overall security risk is low, assuming trusted modules and dependencies.",
