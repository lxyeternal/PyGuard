{
  "purpose": "Declare the package version information as a simple string assignment.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only a static string assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module-level string variable __version__ assigned '4.46.0' with an accompanying docstring. There are no functions, input/output, external data, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code is typical for package metadata, and no security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
