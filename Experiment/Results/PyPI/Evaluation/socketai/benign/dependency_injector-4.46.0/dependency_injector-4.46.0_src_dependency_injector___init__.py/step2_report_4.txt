  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze whether the conclusions are justified and if the scores align with the code's content.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a very simple code snippet: a module-level string variable `__version__` assigned a version number, accompanied by a docstring.\n- There are no functions, input/output, external data sources, or any logic beyond the static assignment.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issue presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code only defines a version string with no functional or malicious code.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Logical and scoring review:\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and justified; the code is straightforward and standard for package versioning.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all cases, which seems reasonable given the simplicity and clarity.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- No issues are present in the code, and the reports reflect that accurately.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are claimed or implied.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nThe reports are thorough, accurate, and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the code snippet, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are appropriate, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustment needed.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
