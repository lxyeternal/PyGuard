  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a test exclusion plugin with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It solely manages configuration data and applies filtering logic. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is effectively 0, with only a minimal cautious risk score (~0.1) due to reading external files. All reports correctly reflect this benign nature, and no adjustments are necessary."
