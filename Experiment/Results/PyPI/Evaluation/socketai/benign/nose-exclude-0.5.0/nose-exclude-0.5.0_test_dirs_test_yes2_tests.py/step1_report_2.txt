  "purpose": "The function appears to be a simple test function returning a boolean value, likely used for testing or placeholder purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input, or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; function is straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'test_fish_dont_run' is unusual but does not indicate malicious intent; the code itself is trivial.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that returns False, with no inputs or external interactions. There are no suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no code injections, and no data leakage points. The function seems to be a placeholder or a simple test case. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a minimal test function with no security concerns.",
