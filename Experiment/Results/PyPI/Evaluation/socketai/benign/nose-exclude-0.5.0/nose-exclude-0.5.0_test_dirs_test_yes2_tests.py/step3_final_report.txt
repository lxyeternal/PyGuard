  "purpose": "A trivial placeholder function returning False, likely used for testing or as a stub.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or data reads; function is self-contained.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; function simply returns a constant value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static function with no inputs, outputs, or side effects. It does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or external communications. The function name is unconventional but not suspicious. All indicators point to benign, placeholder code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies support a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
