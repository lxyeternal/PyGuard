  "purpose": "A minimal placeholder function with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function simply returns a constant value.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single, simple function that returns False, with no external inputs, outputs, or side effects. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence, no obfuscation, and no malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain any security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, placeholder function with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
