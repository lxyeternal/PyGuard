{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to perform some form of data processing or communication, but without context, the exact goal is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'input_data' variable, environment variables, and potentially from network sources or files (depending on undefined parts of the code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or system commands, which could lead to data leaks or system manipulation if fed untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or user input towards network functions, file operations, or system commands, but specific paths are unclear due to missing code sections.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious API usage are detected; however, incomplete code prevents full assessment.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal and lacks detailed implementation. Without more context, it's difficult to identify specific malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or unusual language features are visible. The structure appears standard but incomplete, making full analysis impossible.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided fragment, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. However, due to incomplete information, low confidence is assigned. The code does not show malicious intent but should be reviewed in its full context for a definitive assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
