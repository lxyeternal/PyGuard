{
  "purpose": "A simple placeholder/test function that returns True, with no input, output, or side effects.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the function simply returns a constant value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward function with no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. It does not perform any malicious activity, data leakage, or security-sensitive operations. The code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign scores accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial placeholder function with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, and confidence: 1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
