  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code content, imported modules, hardcoded strings, network calls, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), input/output operations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variables, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as hardcoded strings or network inputs flow into functions like eval/exec or network send/receive, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded URLs or credentials, unusual import patterns, dynamic code execution, inconsistent or hidden data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code with no content or benign structure shows no malicious activity, justified by zero malware and obfuscation scores. Suspicious code employing eval/exec, obfuscation, and hardcoded credentials indicates high likelihood of malicious intent, justified by elevated malware (0.6) and obfuscated (0.8) scores, with a corresponding high security risk (0.65). The reasoning aligns with observed indicators. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that benign code is correctly scored with zero malicious and obfuscation scores, while suspicious, obfuscated code is appropriately rated higher. The scores reflect the evidence, with high suspicion in code exhibiting obfuscation and dynamic execution. No further action required.",
