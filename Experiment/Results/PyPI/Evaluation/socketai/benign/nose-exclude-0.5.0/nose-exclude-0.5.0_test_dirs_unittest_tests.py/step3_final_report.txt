  "purpose": "A simple Python unit test script with no malicious intent, performing trivial assertions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it contains static test methods and functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code is static and self-contained.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code executes static assertions without external data or influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static test suite with no external dependencies, data flows, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malware or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No issues or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, straightforward unit test script with no security concerns. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
