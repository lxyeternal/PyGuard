{
  "purpose": "Defines a simple set of unit tests using the unittest framework to verify basic assertions.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static test functions with hardcoded assertions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or external communications present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only performs static assertions within test functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the unittest module and defines a class with two test methods, as well as a standalone test function. All tests perform simple assertions on True, which are benign. No input reading, no data transmission, no malicious behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to standard testing patterns. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic unit test suite with no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It appears to be a harmless test setup.",
