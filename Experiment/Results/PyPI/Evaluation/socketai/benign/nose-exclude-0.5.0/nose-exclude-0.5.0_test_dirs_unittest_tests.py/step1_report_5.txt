  "purpose": "Define basic unit tests using the unittest framework in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external data or input sources; it solely contains hardcoded test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause a security issue.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only executes static assertions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple unittest.TestCase class with two test methods and a standalone test function. All tests assert True, indicating they are placeholders or trivial tests. There are no external inputs, no network activity, and no complex or unusual code constructs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be for testing purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing setup with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
