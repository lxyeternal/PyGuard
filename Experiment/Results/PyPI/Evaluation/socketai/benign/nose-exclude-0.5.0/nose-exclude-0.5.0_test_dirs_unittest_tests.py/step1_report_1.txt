  "purpose": "The code defines basic unit tests using Python's unittest framework, intended for testing functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains static assertions within test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; tests are simple assertions with no data manipulation or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script includes a standard unittest.TestCase class with two methods and one standalone function, all asserting True. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code appears to be a simple test suite with no external dependencies or dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test module with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
