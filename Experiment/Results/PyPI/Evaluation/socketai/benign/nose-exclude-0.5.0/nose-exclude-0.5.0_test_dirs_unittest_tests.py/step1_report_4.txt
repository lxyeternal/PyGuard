  "purpose": "This code is designed to define and run unit tests using Python's unittest framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the test definitions and the imported unittest module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks, system commands, or other vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input is received via test functions, but there are no untrusted data flows or external data processing involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code strictly defines test cases without any malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the unittest module, defines a test class with two test methods, and a standalone test function. All tests assert True, indicating placeholder or trivial tests. No data input handling, external communication, or sensitive operations are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite with no malicious intent, security issues, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a benign testing script.",
