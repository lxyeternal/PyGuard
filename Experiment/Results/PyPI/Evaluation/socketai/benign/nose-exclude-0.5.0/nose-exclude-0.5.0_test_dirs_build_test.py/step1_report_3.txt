{
  "purpose": "A test function that asserts a false condition, likely used for testing or intentional failure.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "The function purposefully causes an assertion failure; it is unusual outside of testing contexts but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function intended to fail an assertion, which suggests it is for testing purposes or to indicate a failure state. There are no suspicious imports, data reads, or external interactions. It does not contain any malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The function's simplicity and lack of external data handling indicate no malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple test function designed to fail intentionally, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
