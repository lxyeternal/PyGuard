  "purpose": "The function appears to be a test case designed to deliberately fail, likely for testing or placeholder purposes.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the function simply asserts False.",
  "anomalies": "The function purposefully asserts False, which is unusual in production code but common in test cases to ensure failures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that always fails an assertion. It does not import modules, handle data, or perform any operations beyond the assertion. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a placeholder or a deliberate failure test case.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple test function meant to fail intentionally, likely for testing purposes.",
