  "purpose": "This code defines a test function that is designed to fail intentionally.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code contains no input reading or data fetching.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output any data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input-output flows, or source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "The function purposefully asserts failure, which is unusual for production code but common in test cases. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple test function that will always fail due to 'assert False'. It contains no external dependencies, no suspicious behaviors, and no malicious constructs. The function appears to be a placeholder or a deliberate failing test case, not an attack or malicious code. It does not invoke external data, perform network operations, or manipulate system resources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal test case that is designed to fail and contains no malicious intent or security risk. It is typical in testing environments and poses no threat.",
