  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing and validating data, including regex creation, type conversion, and IP resolution checks.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'value', 'item', and 'action'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data outputs or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through type checks and string manipulations; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. Functions perform straightforward data validation and transformation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: one checks if a dictionary is resolvable based on predefined constants; another converts a value to a list; a third creates regex patterns from string templates; the last checks if an input is not an IP network. All functions perform standard, safe operations without external system interactions, data leaks, or malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a safe, utility-focused module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is designed for data validation and transformation tasks, with no external or suspicious operations.",
