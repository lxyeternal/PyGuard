  "purpose": "Utility functions for data validation and pattern matching, including IP resolution check and regex construction.",
  "sources": "Constants import from pycfmodel.constants, function arguments",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data sinks such as network, file, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through functions to produce boolean checks or regex objects; no external data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Regex patterns are constructed from input strings with standard replacements; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: is_resolvable_dict checks if a dict has a specific structure based on IMPLEMENTED_FUNCTIONS, convert_to_list ensures input is returned as a list, regex_from_cf_string creates regex patterns from string actions by replacing wildcards, and not_ip verifies if an object is not an IP network. All functions perform straightforward, safe operations with no side effects, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of sensitive data. The import of IMPLEMENTED_FUNCTIONS from a constants module appears standard and benign. No data leaks, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of benign utility functions for pattern and data structure validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
