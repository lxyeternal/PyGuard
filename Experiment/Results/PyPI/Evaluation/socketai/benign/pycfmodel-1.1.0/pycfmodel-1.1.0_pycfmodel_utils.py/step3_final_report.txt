  "flows": "Input data flows into regex_from_cf_string and is_resolvable_dict, with regex patterns being compiled from potentially untrusted strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward. The regex pattern creation could be misused if fed malicious input, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple utility functions performing data validation, list conversion, regex pattern creation, and IP type checking. All functions rely solely on standard libraries and external constants. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The regex function replaces wildcards with regex equivalents, which could be misused if given malicious patterns, but this is a standard approach. The functions are clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. External constants are assumed benign. The overall behavior is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal risk associated with regex pattern compilation is theoretical and typical for such functions. The scores are consistent with the benign analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
