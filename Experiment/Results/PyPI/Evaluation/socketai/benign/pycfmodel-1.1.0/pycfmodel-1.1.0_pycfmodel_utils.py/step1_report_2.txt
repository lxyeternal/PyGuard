{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for data validation, regex pattern creation, and type checking, likely used in a larger application dealing with network data and CloudFormation templates.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; functions operate on passed arguments and constants imported from pycfmodel.constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; functions return boolean, list, or compiled regex objects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; functions mainly process and transform inputs locally.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: 'is_resolvable_dict' checks for specific dict structure, 'convert_to_list' ensures list output, 'regex_from_cf_string' generates regex patterns from strings with wildcard support, and 'not_ip' verifies if an object is not an IP network instance. All functions perform simple, well-understood operations with no signs of malicious intent or malicious side effects. No external network communication, data leakage, or code injection mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as helper functions without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
