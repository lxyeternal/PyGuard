{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to parse a CloudFormation template using the CFModel library.",
  "sources": "The input 'template' parameter passed to the parse function.",
  "sinks": "The CFModel.model_validate function, which processes the template data.",
  "flows": "Input 'template' -> CFModel.model_validate(template) -> output of parse function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears straightforward without unusual constructs or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports CFModel from an external library and defines a parse function that calls model_validate on the provided template. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is minimal and focused on data validation using a known library. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper around a model validation method, with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
