{
  "purpose": "A simple wrapper function that validates a CloudFormation template using CFModel's model_validate method.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'template' passed directly to CFModel.model_validate",
  "sinks": "CFModel.model_validate processes the input; potential risk depends on its implementation, but not evident here",
  "flows": "Input 'template' flows into CFModel.model_validate, which processes and returns validation results",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward delegation without suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports CFModel, defines a parse function that delegates validation to CFModel.model_validate. It is a minimal, clear wrapper with no obfuscation or malicious code. Security implications depend on CFModel's implementation, which is external. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or data leaks are present in this snippet. The code's simplicity indicates low malware likelihood and minimal security risk, primarily reliant on the external library's security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward validation wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Security risks are minimal and depend on the external CFModel library. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low security risk (~0.1).",
