{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to parse a template using the CFModel class for validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'template' to the parse function.",
  "sinks": "The return statement calls CFModel.model_validate with the template, which may process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input 'template' -> CFModel.model_validate -> return output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code observed. The code relies on an external library for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports CFModel from a library and defines a simple parse function that validates the input template through CFModel.model_validate. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of model_validate suggests a schema or template validation process, which is typical for configuration parsing. The code itself is minimal, straightforward, and uses a well-defined API. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard validation wrapper that leverages an external model for schema validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet.",
