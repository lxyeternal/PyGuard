{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a simple function to parse a CloudFormation template using the CFModel library.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'template' passed to the parse function.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no output, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'template' flows into CFModel.model_validate() for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a model class from a known library, then defines a function that calls a model validation method on the input template. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections, or obfuscated logic. The code's simplicity suggests it's a utility function for validating CloudFormation templates, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for parsing templates with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is low risk overall.",
