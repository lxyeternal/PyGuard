  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Clarifies the code is for resolving CloudFormation templates.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard data flow; no suspicious sinks.\n- Anomalies: Placeholder functions for `GetAtt` and `GetAZs` are incomplete but benign.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity, just incomplete features.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, low risk, no malware.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to above, resolving CloudFormation functions.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard; potential for misuse if input is malicious but no evidence.\n- Anomalies: Placeholders again, no malicious intent.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior; incomplete functions are not suspicious.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate utility.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard; no network or code execution.\n- Anomalies: Warnings for unimplemented functions, not malicious.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Purely a resolver, safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same purpose.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard; no external access.\n- Anomalies: Logging parameter names could leak info but is standard debugging.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same purpose.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard; no network or external modifications.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports or the code snippets show signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, with no obfuscated constructs.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor concerns are:\n  - Placeholder functions (`resolve_get_attr`, `resolve_get_azs`) that are incomplete but benign.\n  - Logging warnings that could potentially leak parameter names if logs are exposed—this is a standard debugging practice, not malicious.\n  - The `resolve_ssm` function retrieves parameters from a provided dictionary, which could be misused if the dictionary contains secrets, but this is expected behavior for such a resolver.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n| Aspect             | Score / Justification                                                                                  |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**       | 0 — No malicious code, payloads, or behaviors detected.                                              |\n| **Obfuscated**    | 0 — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.                                                          |\n| **Risk**          | 0.2 — Slightly elevated due to incomplete functions and logging practices, but overall low.          |\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\nThe code is a legitimate, standard CloudFormation template resolver with no malicious intent. The minor issues are typical in incomplete or debugging code and do not pose security threats.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese align with the reports' findings and the overall code review.",
