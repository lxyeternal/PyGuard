  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Legitimate template resolution functions for CloudFormation.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard data flow; no suspicious data handling.\n- Anomalies: Placeholder functions for unimplemented features (`GetAtt`, `GetAZs`) only log warnings.\n- Analysis: No malicious code, no external network calls, no secrets. The functions are typical for template processing.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate utility. Risk score: **0.2** (standard low risk).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, resolving CloudFormation functions.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard; potential output of base64 or string substitution.\n- Anomalies: Placeholders for unimplemented functions only log warnings.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity; functions process data securely.\n- Conclusion: Safe, with incomplete features but no malicious intent. Risk score: **0.2**.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: CloudFormation template resolver.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard data flow; no external calls.\n- Anomalies: Warnings for unimplemented functions, no secrets or malicious code.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious behavior; functions are for template resolution.\n- Conclusion: Safe, straightforward, low risk. Risk score: **0.2**.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: CloudFormation-like template resolution.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard; logs warnings for missing data.\n- Anomalies: Placeholder functions only log warnings.\n- Analysis: No malicious code or obfuscation; typical template resolver.\n- Conclusion: Safe, low risk. Risk score: **0.2**.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: CloudFormation parameter resolution.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard; no external network activity.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets, only benign warnings.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard implementation. Risk score: **0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The functions are standard for template resolution.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Consistently low (0.2), justified by the standard nature of the code, placeholder functions, and absence of malicious activity.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical CloudFormation template resolver, with no network calls, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs.\n- Placeholder functions (`resolve_get_attr`, `resolve_get_azs`) are only warnings, not malicious.\n- The use of logging warnings for missing parameters or unimplemented features is standard practice.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk (including security risk):** 0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain security risk for this code is very low. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility for CloudFormation template resolution, with no malicious intent or activity.",
