{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to resolve AWS CloudFormation intrinsic functions and parameters, supporting dynamic template processing and parameter resolution.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (`params`, `mappings`, `conditions`), and functions invoked during resolution (e.g., `resolve`, `resolve_ssm`, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Resolved values returned by functions, potentially injected into templates or configurations; notably, `resolve_ssm` accesses external parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through resolution functions, with dynamic resolution based on intrinsic functions and parameter lookups.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. Use of logger warnings for unresolved parameters is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code handles various AWS CloudFormation intrinsic functions, performing parameter resolution, conditional logic, and string manipulations. The functions primarily operate on input data and internal mappings, with some functions intended for external data (e.g., `resolve_ssm`). The code does not perform network access, file modification, or other malicious actions. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, and no hidden backdoors are evident. The logger warnings are benign and standard for template resolution issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for resolving CloudFormation templates with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It handles parameter resolution, conditional logic, and string manipulation securely without dangerous side effects.",
