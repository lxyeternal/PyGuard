{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to resolve various CloudFormation intrinsic functions and parameters, facilitating the processing of infrastructure templates.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (`params`, `function`, `function_body`, `mappings`, `conditions`), external libraries, and logger warnings.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage occurs if untrusted input is processed and outputted without validation; logger warnings could reveal sensitive information if misused. No direct code execution or command invocation found.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through resolve functions, resolving parameters, references, mappings, and conditions into final values. Resolved data can be returned as strings, lists, or dicts, depending on the function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of logger warnings to indicate missing or undefined parameters or mappings; placeholder return values for unimplemented functions (`Fn::GetAtt`, `Fn::GetAZs`) which could be exploited if misunderstood. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily resolves CloudFormation-like intrinsic functions, handling parameters, mappings, conditions, and various functions such as join, split, find_in_map, etc. No evident malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The logger warnings for unimplemented functions might be indicative of incomplete features but do not constitute malicious activity. The functions process data based on trusted input and do not execute external commands or code injection. The code does not include obfuscated constructs or hidden payloads. All functions appear to perform legitimate resolution tasks, with potential minor security considerations in handling missing or undefined parameters, which are mitigated via warning logs and placeholder returns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a resolver for CloudFormation-like templates, with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors detected. It appropriately processes various intrinsic functions and parameters without executing arbitrary code or leaking sensitive data. The only minor concern is the unimplemented functions that return placeholder strings, which are not inherently malicious but could be exploited if the placeholders are misinterpreted in a broader context.",
