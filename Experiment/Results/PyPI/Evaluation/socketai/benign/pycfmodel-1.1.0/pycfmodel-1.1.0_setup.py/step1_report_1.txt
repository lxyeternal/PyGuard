  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup for 'pycfmodel', including dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining dependencies; calling setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Reading file content for description, then passing data to setup(), which is standard behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads the README file for the long description, defines dependencies for installation, development, and documentation, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. No use of untrusted input or insecure practices detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious or security risks detected. It adheres to typical patterns used in Python packaging without any suspicious elements.",
