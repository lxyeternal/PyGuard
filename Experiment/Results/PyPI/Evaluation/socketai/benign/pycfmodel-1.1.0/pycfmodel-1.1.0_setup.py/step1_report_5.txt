{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package including dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package dependencies specified as strings.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic input or untrusted data sources; no sink points for untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; dependency specifications are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; dependencies are standard, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles static package setup information using standard setuptools functions. The dependencies are explicitly listed as strings, with no user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, malicious patterns, or anomalies are detected. The code adheres to common setup conventions and does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for a Python project.",
