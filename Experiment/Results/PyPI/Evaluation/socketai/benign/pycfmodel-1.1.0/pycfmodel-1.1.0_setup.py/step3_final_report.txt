  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; defines dependencies; uses find_namespace_packages to discover packages; calls setuptools.setup() with metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or external data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script; no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package, performing static configuration tasks. It reads a local README file, defines dependencies explicitly, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code, user input, network calls, or obfuscated constructs are present. All dependencies are version-locked and explicitly listed. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detected. The code follows standard practices and is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, standard, and free of security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identified it as a typical setup script with no anomalies. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. Confidence in this assessment is 1.",
