  "purpose": "Define custom Pydantic models with specific configuration constraints and validation logic.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pydantic and pycfmodel.utils; class definitions; the is_resolvable_dict function.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data handling outside validation functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the models, particularly through the check_if_valid_function validator, which invokes is_resolvable_dict.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom validator that checks if a dictionary is 'resolvable'; the is_resolvable_dict function is imported but not defined here, raising questions about its implementation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models, CustomModel with 'forbid' extra fields, and FunctionDict with 'allow' extra fields. The FunctionDict includes a 'before' mode model validator, check_if_valid_function, which uses is_resolvable_dict to validate the input dictionary. This function likely checks if the dict has a specific structure (e.g., exactly one key representing a function). There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The validator simply enforces structural constraints on the input data, and no external network or system modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard for schema validation with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It enforces data structure rules within the application context. No malware, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
