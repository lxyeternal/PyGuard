  "sources": "Import statements from pydantic and pycfmodel.utils; class methods accessing input data",
  "sinks": "Validation functions that process input data; potential data flow in model_validator",
  "flows": "Input data fed into CustomModel or FunctionDict → validation via model_validator → potential exception if validation fails",
  "anomalies": "Use of is_resolvable_dict suggests validation based on external utility; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models, CustomModel and FunctionDict, with different configurations. FunctionDict uses a pre-validation method to check if its input is a resolvable dictionary with a single key-function structure, via the is_resolvable_dict utility. The code's purpose is to enforce data validation rules. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or malicious flow is evident. The models perform standard validation tasks, and no external communication, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. The import from pycfmodel.utils is legitimate and relevant to validation. Overall, the code appears safe, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines validation models for specific data structures using Pydantic. It employs standard practices and utility functions for validation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is safe and intended for data validation within a larger application context.",
