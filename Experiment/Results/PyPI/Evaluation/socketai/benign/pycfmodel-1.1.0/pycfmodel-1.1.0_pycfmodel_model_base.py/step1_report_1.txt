  "purpose": "Define data models using pydantic with custom validation for function-like dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Imports from pydantic and pycfmodel.utils, class attributes, and the check_if_valid_function validator method.",
  "sinks": "Potential validation flow where untrusted data could trigger exceptions or validation errors.",
  "flows": "Input data fed into CustomModel or FunctionDict, validated by model_validator, specifically check_if_valid_function for FunctionDict.",
  "anomalies": "Use of is_resolvable_dict suggests validation of specific dictionary structure; no apparent suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pydantic models with different configurations: CustomModel forbids extra fields, FunctionDict allows extra fields but validates that input is a resolvable dictionary with a single key, intended as a function. The code relies on an external utility is_resolvable_dict for validation. No data is read from untrusted sources directly, and no code injection or malicious behavior is apparent. The validator enforces structural constraints on the input, and no suspicious or malicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of data validation models using pydantic, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It enforces specific data structures for configuration purposes, relying on external utility for validation. Overall, it presents low security concern.",
