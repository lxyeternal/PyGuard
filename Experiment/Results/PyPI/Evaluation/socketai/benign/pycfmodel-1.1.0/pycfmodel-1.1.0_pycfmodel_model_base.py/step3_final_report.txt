  "purpose": "Define Pydantic models with specific validation rules for configuration schemas.",
  "sources": "External utility function 'is_resolvable_dict' used within the validation method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; validation occurs internally.",
  "flows": "Input data passes through model_validator, then 'is_resolvable_dict' for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of Pydantic features; reliance on external utility without internal implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models with configuration constraints. 'CustomModel' forbids extra fields; 'FunctionDict' allows extra fields but validates that the dictionary structure is resolvable as a function via 'is_resolvable_dict'. No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The external utility's benign nature is assumed, and no network or data exfiltration occurs. The validation logic is standard, and the code is clear and well-structured. The reliance on an external utility does not inherently introduce risk unless malicious, which is not indicated here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The external utility 'is_resolvable_dict' is assumed safe. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code is suitable for use in configuration validation scenarios.",
