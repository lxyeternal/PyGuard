{
  "purpose": "Defines two Pydantic models, CustomModel and FunctionDict, with specific configuration constraints and validation logic for FunctionDict.",
  "sources": "Imports from pydantic and pycfmodel.utils; no data input or external data sources within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is written or sent to external systems, no untrusted data handling beyond validation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; validation is internal and limited to model configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of @model_validator with mode='before' is valid; no unusual or suspicious code features. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data models with specific configuration options: CustomModel forbids extra fields, while FunctionDict allows extra fields and validates that it contains only one key and that this key represents a resolvable function. The validation relies on the external is_resolvable_dict function, which likely checks if the dictionary represents a valid function. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The code is straightforward, uses standard practices, and does not include any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Pydantic models with custom validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured snippet intended for data validation.",
