{
  "purpose": "Define Pydantic models with specific validation rules and configurations.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from external libraries: pydantic and pycfmodel.utils. The function is_resolvable_dict is used within the validator.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks, such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications. The validation logic is limited to checking the structure of input data.",
  "flows": "Input data is received as 'values' in the check_if_valid_function method, passed from external sources when creating instances of FunctionDict. The function is_resolvable_dict assesses the data, potentially influencing validation flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself appears straightforward, with no obfuscated constructs or suspicious patterns. Usage of is_resolvable_dict could be scrutinized if its implementation is malicious, but as imported, it seems to be a utility function. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models with distinct configurations: CustomModel forbids extra fields, while FunctionDict allows extra fields and includes a validator to ensure that the input is a resolvable dictionary, likely representing a function. The validation depends on an external utility, but no suspicious behavior is evident from its usage. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or system modifications. It is a typical validation setup with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of Pydantic models with validation, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. It appears to be part of a larger schema validation system without harmful intent.",
