{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define constants and regular expressions related to AWS CloudFormation templates and parameter resolution, likely used for parsing or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Constants and regular expressions defined for use within the code, including pattern matching for template parameters and special values.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs; no processing or data handling that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident; the code mainly defines patterns and constants without dynamic processing or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants and regex patterns for recognizing specific AWS CloudFormation template features and parameters. It includes regex patterns for detecting wildcard characters, CloudFormation parameters, and SSM parameters. The constants like 'AWS_NOVALUE' and zero IP ranges are standard placeholders or default values. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic behaviors that could be malicious. The code appears to serve as a utility or configuration module for other components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting solely of constants and regex pattern definitions used for parsing or validation tasks related to AWS CloudFormation templates. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
