{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define constants and regular expressions for processing AWS CloudFormation templates or similar infrastructure-as-code configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads constants and regex patterns used for pattern matching and string comparisons related to AWS CloudFormation and SSM parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code snippet; it primarily sets up patterns and constants. No untrusted data flow or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident in this snippet; it only prepares regex patterns and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code are present. The regex patterns are straightforward and serve configuration parsing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module, defines constants for AWS-specific values, and compiles regex patterns to detect certain placeholders or parameters within strings. These patterns identify wildcard characters, CloudFormation parameters, and SSM parameter references. The constants seem to be used for infrastructure template validation or parsing. No data manipulation, external calls, or suspicious logic are present. The overall structure is simple and focused on pattern matching and constant definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as setup for processing AWS CloudFormation or similar templates. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks are identified.",
