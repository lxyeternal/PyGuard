  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining constants and regex patterns for AWS CloudFormation template parsing or validation.\n- No external data handling, execution, or dynamic processing is mentioned.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are identified.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward setup for pattern matching, with no evidence of malware or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is simple, defining constants and regex patterns. There are no evident errors or flaws.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No input handling or processing that could be exploited.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n  - **Security risk:** All assign 0, justified by the lack of dynamic or sensitive operations.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The regex patterns are standard for detecting wildcards, CloudFormation parameters, and SSM parameters.\n- Constants like `AWS_NOVALUE`, `IPV4_ZERO_VALUE`, and `IPV6_ZERO_VALUE` are typical placeholders.\n- No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware and obfuscated, securityRisk at 0, confidence at 1 or 0.9) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- Since all reports agree on benignity, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional note:** Given the simplicity and clarity of the code, I concur with the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign setup for pattern matching in AWS CloudFormation templates, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are needed.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's nature.",
