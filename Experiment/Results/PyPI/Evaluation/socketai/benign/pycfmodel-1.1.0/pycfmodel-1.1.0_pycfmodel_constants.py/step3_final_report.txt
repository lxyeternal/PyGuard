  "purpose": "Define constants and regex patterns for AWS CloudFormation template validation and parameter detection.",
  "sources": "Constants such as AWS_NOVALUE, IPV4_ZERO_VALUE, IPV6_ZERO_VALUE; regex patterns CONTAINS_STAR, CONTAINS_CF_PARAM, CONTAINS_SSM_PARAMETER.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process input or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "The regex patterns are compiled for pattern matching but are not applied to untrusted data within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines constants and regex patterns related to AWS CloudFormation templates. No dynamic logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. The regex patterns are standard for detecting wildcards, parameters, and SSM references. Constants are typical placeholders. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign setup code for AWS CloudFormation validation, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, standard configuration snippet.",
