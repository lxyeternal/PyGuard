{
  "purpose": "Define constants, regular expressions, and a set of AWS CloudFormation functions for later use in processing or validation.",
  "sources": "Constants and regex patterns are defined directly in the code; no external data input is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are detected. The regex patterns and constants are standard for template processing.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up constants for special values (like 'NoValue' and zero network addresses) and compiles regex patterns to detect wildcards, CloudFormation parameters, and SSM parameters. These are typical for configuration or template validation scripts. No external data handling or execution logic is present that could be malicious. There are no suspicious or obfuscated code patterns, nor signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard configuration or validation setup with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
