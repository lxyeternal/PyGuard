  "purpose": "Define constants and compile regex patterns for parsing and recognizing specific AWS CloudFormation templates and parameters.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines constants and regex patterns, not input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or transmitted to external systems.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow is evident as the code only sets up constants and regex patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be straightforward setup of constants and regexes without suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module, defines constants for AWS-specific values, and compiles regex patterns likely used for parsing CloudFormation templates or parameter strings. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The regex patterns target common template parameters and IP address ranges, and constants denote placeholder or default values. The overall structure is typical for configuration or parser setup, with no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as setup for parsing or processing AWS CloudFormation templates and parameters. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
