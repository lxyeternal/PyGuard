{
  "purpose": "Define constants and compile regex patterns likely used for parsing or validating CloudFormation or similar templates.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; regex patterns may be used to match input data later in the code.",
  "sinks": "None directly, but regex patterns could be used on untrusted data to identify specific patterns.",
  "flows": "Potential flow involves matching untrusted input against regex patterns, but no direct input processing or data flow is shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to define constants and regex patterns for template parsing or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, a set of implemented functions related to CloudFormation, and regex patterns to identify wildcards, parameters, and SSM parameters. No input handling, data processing, or sensitive operations are present. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be part of a larger validation or parsing utility.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet contains only constants and regex pattern definitions for parsing or validation purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified based on this code alone.",
