  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is solely defining constants and regex patterns related to AWS CloudFormation templates.\n- No input processing, data handling, or execution logic is present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are detected.\n- The regex patterns and constants are standard for configuration or validation scripts.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows from untrusted sources are evident.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers are certain of their benign assessment.\n- Malware scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  **Yes.** The reports correctly identify that the code only defines constants and regex patterns, with no malicious or suspicious logic.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  **No.** The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code content.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports assign malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, and obfuscated = 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- **Are any scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  **No.** All are 0 or 0.9 for confidence, which is justified.\n\n### Malware score:\n- **Is the malware score accurate?**  \n  **Yes.** The code does not perform any malicious actions; the malware score should be 0.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  **No.** The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's content.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  **Yes.** The scores align with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since it's just configuration constants, minimal risk)  \n\n**Note:** While the code itself is benign, if it were part of a larger system that processes untrusted input using these regex patterns, potential risks could emerge. However, based solely on this snippet, the risk remains negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is purely setup for pattern matching and constants related to AWS CloudFormation. No malicious or security-critical issues are present. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there is no evidence to justify higher risk or malware scores.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware = 0  \n- Keep obfuscated = 0  \n- Set overall security risk to 0 or very close to it, given the context.",
