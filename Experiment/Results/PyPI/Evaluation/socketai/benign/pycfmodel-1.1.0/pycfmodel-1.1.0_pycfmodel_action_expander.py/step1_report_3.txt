{
  "purpose": "This code appears to process AWS CloudFormation policies, specifically expanding 'Action' and 'NotAction' fields based on patterns, likely for validation or transformation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the 'obj' parameter passed to 'expand_actions', and within that, it reads keys 'Action' and 'NotAction'. It also references 'CLOUDFORMATION_ACTIONS' and calls 'regex_from_cf_string' for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "The code updates the 'obj' structure in-place, modifying 'Action' and 'NotAction' values. No external data or system calls are directly involved. No data leaks or external communication are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into 'expand_actions' -> traverses into nested dicts/lists -> triggers '_expand_actions' and '_expand_action' -> uses regex matching against 'CLOUDFORMATION_ACTIONS' to expand or exclude actions -> modifies the input object in-place.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code uses regex matching to filter actions, which appears standard. No obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns, no malicious code or backdoors are evident. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to expand or exclude AWS CloudFormation action strings based on regex patterns. It relies on external references like 'CLOUDFORMATION_ACTIONS' and 'regex_from_cf_string'. There are no system calls, network communication, or sensitive data handling. The logic is consistent with pattern matching and set operations. No anomalies or malicious constructs are detected. The use of regex and list/set operations are standard and do not introduce risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for expanding AWS policy actions based on patterns. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
