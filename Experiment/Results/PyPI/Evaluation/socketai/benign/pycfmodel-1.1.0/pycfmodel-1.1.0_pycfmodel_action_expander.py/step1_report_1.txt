{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to expand AWS CloudFormation actions and not-actions into specific permission strings based on pattern matching, facilitating policy validation or generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters 'action', 'actions', and 'obj', which can contain strings, lists, or dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Data is modified in-place within dictionaries and lists; no external data sinks are explicitly present. No system commands, network calls, or sensitive data access are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into pattern matching functions, and the results replace original data structures; no external outputs or side-effects are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The functions perform standard pattern matching and list/set operations. No obfuscation or malicious intent appears evident.",
  "analysis": "The code uses pattern matching to filter or exclude specific cloud formation actions based on regex patterns generated from input strings. It safely handles input types (str, list, dict) with type checks, raising exceptions for unsupported types. Data transformations are straightforward and do not include external system interactions. There are no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for expanding CloudFormation actions based on patterns. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its operations are confined to pattern matching and data restructuring without external effects or sensitive data handling.",
