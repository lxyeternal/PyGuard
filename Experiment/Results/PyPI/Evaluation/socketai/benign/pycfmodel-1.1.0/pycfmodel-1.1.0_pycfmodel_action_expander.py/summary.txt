  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for expanding AWS CloudFormation actions based on regex patterns. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the safety of the external 'regex_from_cf_string' function. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk is conservatively estimated at approximately 0.1, reflecting the low but non-zero potential for pattern injection if inputs are untrusted. The existing reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with this analysis."
