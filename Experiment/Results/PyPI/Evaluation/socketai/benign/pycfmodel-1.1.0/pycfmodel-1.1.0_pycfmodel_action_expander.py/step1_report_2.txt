{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to expand AWS CloudFormation action strings or lists into their full set of actions, possibly filtering out certain actions based on patterns.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: 'action', 'actions', and 'obj', which can be strings, lists, or dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the input 'obj' in place by replacing 'Action' and 'NotAction' keys with expanded lists of actions, but does not involve external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings, lists, dicts) flows into functions, where pattern matching occurs to filter actions, then the data is expanded and stored back into the 'obj' structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code relies on external 'pycfmodel' library for regex and action list. No obfuscated code or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The functions use standard Python type checks and set operations to expand action patterns based on regex matching. The code handles nested structures recursively, updating the input object. No external network, file I/O, or sensitive data handling is present. The use of external library 'pycfmodel' is for pattern matching and is not suspicious. No malicious code or malware patterns are found. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to CloudFormation permissions expansion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for expanding CloudFormation actions and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs pattern-based expansion safely. No security threats or malware indications are present.",
