{
  "purpose": "A data model representing CloudFormation parameters with a method to compute parameter values based on input and internal attributes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'provided_value', class attributes such as 'Default', 'NoEcho', and 'Type'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in 'get_ref_value' method, potentially returning constant strings or stringified values.",
  "flows": "Input 'provided_value' flows into 'value' variable; depending on 'NoEcho' and 'Type', different return paths are taken, including splitting or string conversion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of constant strings like 'NO_ECHO_WITH_VALUE' for 'NoEcho' scenarios; no external calls or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data class modeling CloudFormation parameters. The 'get_ref_value' method handles input values and internal attributes to determine the output. No external network calls, code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The handling of 'NoEcho' with constant strings is standard for CloudFormation. The splitting of list types assumes string input, which is typical. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The logic is simple, well-structured, and aligns with expected behavior for such a model.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the low threat level. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
