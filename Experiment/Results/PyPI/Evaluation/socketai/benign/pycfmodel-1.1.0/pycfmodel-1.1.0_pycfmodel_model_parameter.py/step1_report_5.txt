  "purpose": "Defines a CloudFormation Parameter model with methods to compute parameter reference values based on various properties.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as provided_value argument in get_ref_value method, class attributes Default, NoEcho, and Type.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in get_ref_value method, particularly returning constant strings or transformed input values.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into get_ref_value, where they are processed based on NoEcho, Type, and Default properties, resulting in output values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious external calls or obfuscated code present. Usage of constants and straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data model for CloudFormation parameters, including validation and a method to compute parameter references. The method only processes input data and returns string or list values, with no external network or file operations. It does not contain any code that could be used maliciously or malicious behavior, nor any obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data model with a utility method for parameter value calculation. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The logic is straightforward and safe.",
