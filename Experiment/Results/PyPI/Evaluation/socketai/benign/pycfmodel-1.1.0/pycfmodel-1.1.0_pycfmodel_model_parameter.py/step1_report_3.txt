  "purpose": "Define a CloudFormation Parameter model with methods to compute parameter reference values based on properties.",
  "sources": "None identified; no external data input sources are used in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no external data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The class primarily manages data representation and simple logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data model for CloudFormation parameters using pydantic, with a method to determine parameter reference values based on properties like NoEcho, Default, and Type. The method uses straightforward conditional logic without executing untrusted input as code, nor does it perform network operations or data leaks. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The only noteworthy aspect is the handling of NoEcho scenarios, which is standard for CloudFormation parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model implementation with logic for parameter value determination. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
