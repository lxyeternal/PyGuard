{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class for an optional named policy document, encapsulating a name and a policy document object.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (dataclasses, typing) and a specific model (pycfmodel.model.resources.properties.policy_document).",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or untrusted data handling; no data leaks or unsafe operations identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code merely defines a data structure without processing input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class with optional fields, importing only necessary modules. No user input handling, external data fetching, or dynamic execution is present. The imported PolicyDocument appears to be a model class, likely used for data modeling rather than malicious activity. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data structure definition with no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks detected. It appears safe and standard.",
