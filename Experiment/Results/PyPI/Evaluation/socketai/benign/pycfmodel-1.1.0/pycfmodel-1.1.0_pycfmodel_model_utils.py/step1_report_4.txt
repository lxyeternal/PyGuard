  "purpose": "Define a data structure for an optionally named policy document object",
  "sources": "No input sources; imports and class attributes",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external output",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines a simple data class with an optional string and a PolicyDocument object. There are no input/output operations, no code execution, and no manipulation of untrusted data. It appears to be a straightforward data container without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic data class definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply models a policy document with an optional name.",
