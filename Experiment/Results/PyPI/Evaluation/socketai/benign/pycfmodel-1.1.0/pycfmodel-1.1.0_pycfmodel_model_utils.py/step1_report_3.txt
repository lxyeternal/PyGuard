{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class for an optional named policy document, likely used as a data structure in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, and an external module 'pycfmodel.model.resources.properties.policy_document'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process or execute data in a way that could lead to leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code only defines a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data class definition with optional string attribute and a policy document object. It imports only standard modules and a specific class from an external library. There are no input handling, no data processing, and no external network or system commands. No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign data class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply structures data for use elsewhere in an application.",
