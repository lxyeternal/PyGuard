  "purpose": "Define a data structure to optionally associate a name with a PolicyDocument object.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dataclasses, typing, and PolicyDocument class; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines a class structure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple data class definition with optional naming, importing only standard and external library modules. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling or security-sensitive processing. It appears to serve as a straightforward data container without any malicious intent or malicious behavior. The class structure is clean and typical for modeling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a standard data class definition used for holding a policy document and an optional name.",
