  "purpose": "Defines a data class representing an optional named policy document for use in a larger security or configuration management system.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (dataclasses, typing) and a third-party module (pycfmodel). No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no data output, network activity, or external resource interaction.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares a data structure without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a data class with an optional string and a PolicyDocument object. There are no runtime operations, data validation, external input handling, or side effects. It appears to be part of a configuration or policy management system, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data class definition without any malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. It is safe and standard in structure.",
