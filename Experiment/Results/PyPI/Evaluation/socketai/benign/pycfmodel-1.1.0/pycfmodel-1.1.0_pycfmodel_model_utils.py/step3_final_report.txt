  "purpose": "Defines a data class for an optional named policy document, serving as a configuration or data container.",
  "sources": "Import of PolicyDocument class from pycfmodel.model.resources.properties.policy_document",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, external input, or output present",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares a data structure without runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward data class with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a data model, then declares a simple data class with optional name and policy document fields. It contains no functions, runtime logic, external data processing, or network activity. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators. The code serves as a configuration or data container in a larger system, with no evident security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data class with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. It is safe for use in production environments.",
