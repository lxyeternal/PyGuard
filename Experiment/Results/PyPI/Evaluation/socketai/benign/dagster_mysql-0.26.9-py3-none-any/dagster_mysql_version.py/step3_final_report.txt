  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a simple string assignment.",
  "sources": "No external sources; the code assigns a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow, external calls, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a direct assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, network calls, or complex logic are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or malicious intent are detected. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
