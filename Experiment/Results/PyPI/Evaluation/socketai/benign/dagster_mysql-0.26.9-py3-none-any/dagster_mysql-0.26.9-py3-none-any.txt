The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score can be confidently set at 0.1. Overall, it poses minimal supply chain security risk and is safe for use."

      "conclusion": "Most code samples are benign with low scores, but report 4's use of eval/exec and obfuscation justifies increased suspicion. Slightly elevating malware score to 0.4 improves alignment with potential risks. The overall security posture remains moderate, emphasizing the need for further dynamic analysis for suspicious patterns."
