  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the findings are accurate, consistent, and justified, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions for MySQL connection management, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. It uses standard libraries, handles retries, and parses URLs securely.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The confidence is high (1.0), and the malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is sound, and the security risk score (0.1) is reasonable given the nature of connection handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no suspicious logic, and safe handling. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code’s straightforward connection management and retry logic. No malicious indicators or obfuscation are detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The scores are consistent with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard connection utility functions with retry logic, no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and safe handling of configuration data.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The mention that the code relies on external configuration and URL parsing is accurate. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The security risk score (0.2) seems appropriate for a connection utility, which could be misused if configuration is compromised, but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical MySQL connection utility with proper error handling, retries, and URL parsing. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes that the code is standard, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The handling of sensitive data via URL components is appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The security risk score (0.1) is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing standard connection management, retries, and configuration handling. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent, with no red flags. The confidence is high, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No. All reports agree that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None detected. The analyses are consistent, detailed, and justified.\n\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk around 0.1-0.2) are reasonable given the code’s nature.\n\n- **Potential risks:** The only minimal concern is that connection parameters come from external sources, which could be misused if the configuration is compromised. But this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** None detected or suggested by the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, typical for connection utilities, mainly due to external configuration handling)\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, well-implemented database connection utility with robust retry logic, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**The code is safe, standard, and free of supply chain or malicious concerns.**",
