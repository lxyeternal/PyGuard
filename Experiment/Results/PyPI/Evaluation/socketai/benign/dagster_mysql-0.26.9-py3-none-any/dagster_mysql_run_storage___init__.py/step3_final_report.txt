  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources are read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; the code does not contain sinks that could leak data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports a class, with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious syntax detected. The import is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing a class from an external package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code. The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty that the code is safe. The package imported is a known component used in data orchestration workflows, and the import alone does not pose security risks. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments across the reports are appropriate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted based solely on this import statement.",
