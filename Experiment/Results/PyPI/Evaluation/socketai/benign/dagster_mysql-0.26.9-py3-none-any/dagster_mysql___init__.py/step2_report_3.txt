  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is straightforward import and registration; no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The confidence is perfect (1). These seem appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malware or obfuscation; the code is purely structural.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, standard import and registration.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Slightly above zero, but given the code's simplicity, this might be an overestimation. The confidence is 1.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the minor securityRisk score could be a default or conservative estimate but seems unwarranted here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, purely import and registration; no dynamic or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Similar to previous, perhaps slightly overestimating.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of risk beyond standard package setup.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same conclusion—standard setup code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely for module setup.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with a malware score of 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation; score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's nature as a simple import and registration script, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is justified. The slight 0.1 in some reports likely reflects a conservative default; I would set this at 0 for accuracy.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, standard package setup code with no security concerns. The scores should reflect that.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent in their assessment; I concur with their conclusions that there is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk in this code snippet.",
