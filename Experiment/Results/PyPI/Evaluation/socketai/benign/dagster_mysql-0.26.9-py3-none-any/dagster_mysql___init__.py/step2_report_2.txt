  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a straightforward import and registration script with no malicious behavior. The confidence score is 1, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5 (or lower). The report assigns 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code is standard setup code with no suspicious activity. The confidence is 1, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.5 or less. The report assigns 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still concludes benign intent. The securityRisk is 0.1, which might be slightly high given the code's nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. This is acceptable, but perhaps a risk score of 0.1 is marginally high; the code is purely static imports.\n- **Recommendation:** A risk score of 0 or 0.05 might be more appropriate, but 0.1 is not unreasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity. Confidence=1, scores all zero.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. This aligns well.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, with high confidence and no suspicious behavior. Risk score is 0, which is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is correct given the static import and registration code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly zero or very low, which is appropriate. The only minor point is Report 3's risk score of 0.1, which might be slightly high for such benign code.\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or 0.05 for most; 0.1 in one case (Report 3). I would suggest standardizing to 0 for such static import code, unless there's a reason to consider minimal risk.\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical setup script for a Python package, involving static imports, registration, and exposure of classes. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior is present. The scores in the reports are reasonable, with minor adjustments possible for the risk score in Report 3.\n\n**My final assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.05 if considering minimal, inherent risks in static import code)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code.",
