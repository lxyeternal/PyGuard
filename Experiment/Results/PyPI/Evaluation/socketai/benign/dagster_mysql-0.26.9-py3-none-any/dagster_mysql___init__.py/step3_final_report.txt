  "purpose": "Module setup and registration for dagster-mysql integration, exposing classes and registering version.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, version import, registration call, class definitions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network activity, no data leaks",
  "flows": "Import statements and registration are static; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements, registration of a library version, and exposure of classes for a Python package. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, no network operations, and no hardcoded secrets. The code's purpose is to initialize and expose components, which is standard and benign. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a module setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The appropriate scores are zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
