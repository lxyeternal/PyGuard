  "malware_score": 0.4,
  "security_risk": 0.55,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "Most code samples are benign with low scores, but report 4's use of eval/exec and obfuscation justifies increased suspicion. Slightly elevating malware score to 0.4 improves alignment with potential risks. The overall security posture remains moderate, emphasizing the need for further dynamic analysis for suspicious patterns."
