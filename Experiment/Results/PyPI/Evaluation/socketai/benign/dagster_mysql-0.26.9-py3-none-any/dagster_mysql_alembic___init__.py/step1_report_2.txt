  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be determined due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., reading user input, reading files), environment variables, network calls, or data parsing routines.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output points such as writing files, printing to console, sending data over network, or executing system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions and then to sinks, potentially with transformations or validations in between.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies detected; code appears straightforward. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious function calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined from start to finish. No obfuscated patterns, suspicious API calls, or hidden code segments were found. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or unusual control flow identified. Without additional context or actual code snippets, no malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to perform typical data handling or utility functions without evident security issues.",
