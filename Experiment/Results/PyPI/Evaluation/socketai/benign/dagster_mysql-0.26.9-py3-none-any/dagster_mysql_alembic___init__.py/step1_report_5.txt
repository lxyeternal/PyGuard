  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to involve data processing or utility functions based on the structure.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include user inputs, environment variables, and imported modules that could read external data or configurations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands which could be exploited if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user inputs or environment variables through processing functions and potentially into sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. No malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration or system modification are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python with typical imports and functions. There are no indications of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms. The structure is straightforward, and no suspicious patterns emerge upon review. The absence of obfuscation or hidden code suggests a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It appears to be a benign utility or application code with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
