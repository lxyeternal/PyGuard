  "purpose": "Provides MySQL-backed storage for Dagster, managing schema, heartbeats, key-value pairs, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Database connection, schema creation, heartbeat data, key-value pairs, version queries.",
  "sinks": "Database insert/update operations for heartbeats and key-value pairs, schema migration.",
  "flows": "Source: input data from heartbeat or key-value inputs; Sink: database insert/update statements; Flow: data flows from method calls to database operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages database connections securely, uses parameterized queries, and handles schema migrations properly. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. Connection handling via context managers and proper schema management indicate a standard, secure implementation. No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured backend component for Dagster's MySQL storage, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate given the context and implementation.",
