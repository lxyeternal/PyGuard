  "purpose": "Import the MySQLScheduleStorage class from the dagster_mysql.schedule_storage module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the package dagster_mysql.schedule_storage.schedule_storage.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; the code only imports a class.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads the class into the namespace; no data flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, syntactically correct import statement importing MySQLScheduleStorage from an external package. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The import is from a known package, and the code does not perform any dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence level of 1 is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and require no adjustments.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
