  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward import statement.\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code is a simple import with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, with obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores all at 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The code is a benign import statement; thus, the risk should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they focus solely on the code presented.\n   - They do not speculate beyond the provided snippet.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code snippet is a standard import statement importing a class from an external package. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The environment and context are typical for dependency imports in Python projects.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports and the nature of the code.",
