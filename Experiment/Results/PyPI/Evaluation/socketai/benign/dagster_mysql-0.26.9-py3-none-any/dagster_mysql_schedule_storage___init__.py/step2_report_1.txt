  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the validity of their conclusions, the scoring, and whether any issues are present.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a straightforward import statement importing `MySQLScheduleStorage` from `dagster_mysql.schedule_storage`.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the assessments.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, consistent with the simplicity of the code.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The import statement is syntactically correct and appears to import a class from an external package.\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are detected; the code is standard and does not contain any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n### Logical and reasoning review:\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior.\n- No false positives or over-scoring is evident.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are justified.\n\n### Scores:\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about supply chain risks, which are not evident here.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (simple, clear import)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The code snippet itself is benign; the focus should be on the package's trustworthiness, but that is outside the scope of this import statement alone.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are needed.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.**",
