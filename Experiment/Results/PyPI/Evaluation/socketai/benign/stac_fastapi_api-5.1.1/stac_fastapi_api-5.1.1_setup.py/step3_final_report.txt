  "purpose": "Package setup configuration for the Python project 'stac-fastapi.api'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for description; static dependency lists; package metadata defined directly in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Static data used in setup() call; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and static with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script that reads a static README file, defines dependencies, and calls setuptools.setup() with fixed metadata. No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The dependencies are typical, and the code structure is conventional. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified given the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
