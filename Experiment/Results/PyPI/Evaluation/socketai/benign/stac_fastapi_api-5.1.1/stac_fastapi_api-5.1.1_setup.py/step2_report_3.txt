  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` configuration script for a Python package.\n- All reports agree that there are no suspicious behaviors, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no network activity, and no malicious logic.\n- The code reads a README file, defines static dependencies, and calls `setuptools.setup()` with package metadata.\n- The dependencies are typical for a Python package, including development, testing, and documentation extras.\n- No untrusted input sources, data sinks, or external code execution points are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and functions as intended for package setup.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code only handles static configuration data.\n\n### Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are found.\n- The code is typical for package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The dependency lists are static and do not involve dynamic code execution or external data fetching.\n- The code does not process untrusted input or perform any network operations.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough reviews and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The package setup code is safe, standard, and free from security concerns.",
