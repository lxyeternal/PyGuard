  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'stac-fastapi.api' Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup and find_namespace_packages from setuptools; defining dependency lists; reading package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains untrusted data sinks; no execution of external commands, network operations, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only processes static data for setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is standard setup script with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools functions, reads a markdown file for description, defines dependency lists, and calls setup() with static metadata. All operations are typical for package setup. No input validation, no dynamic execution, no external data processing or network activity is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely configures package metadata and dependencies.",
