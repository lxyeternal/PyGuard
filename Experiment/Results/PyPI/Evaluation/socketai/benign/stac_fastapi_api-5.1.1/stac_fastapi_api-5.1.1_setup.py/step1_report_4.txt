  "sources": "Reading README.md file; user-provided dependency lists; package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data sinks identified).",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setup configuration; defining dependencies and package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No obfuscated code or unusual runtime behaviors. No network connections or data exfiltration points present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It reads a README file, defines dependencies, and sets package metadata. All code appears to serve legitimate purposes related to package setup. The dependencies are typical for development, testing, and documentation, with no signs of malicious code or suspicious behavior. There are no input sources that could be exploited or data sinks that could leak information. No code injection, obfuscated logic, or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for package installation and distribution.",
