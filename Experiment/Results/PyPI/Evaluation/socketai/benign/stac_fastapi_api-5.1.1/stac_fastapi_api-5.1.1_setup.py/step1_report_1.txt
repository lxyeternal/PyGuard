{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'stac-fastapi.api', including dependencies, metadata, and package discovery settings.",
  "sources": "File reading for README.md, static lists for dependencies, and setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; the code only processes static configuration data.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily handles package setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors detected. All code appears standard for a setup.py configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README.md file for the long description, specifies dependencies and extras, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no user input handling, no network operations, or credential management. The dependencies are static strings, and all package metadata is hardcoded. No evidence of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for a Python package distribution configuration.",
