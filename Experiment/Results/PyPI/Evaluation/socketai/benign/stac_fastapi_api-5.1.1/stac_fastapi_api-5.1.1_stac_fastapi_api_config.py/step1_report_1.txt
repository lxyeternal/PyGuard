  "purpose": "Define enumerations for STAC API extensions and third-party add-ons.",
  "sources": "The enum class definitions with string values.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or between components; static enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is straightforward and appears to be configuration constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports enum and defines two enumeration classes: ApiExtensions and AddOns, each containing string constants representing different features or extensions. There is no dynamic code, user input handling, or external data processing. The comment indicates future plans to move to a schema-based approach but does not affect current behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign definition of enums used for configuration purposes. It contains no malicious or security-sensitive content.",
