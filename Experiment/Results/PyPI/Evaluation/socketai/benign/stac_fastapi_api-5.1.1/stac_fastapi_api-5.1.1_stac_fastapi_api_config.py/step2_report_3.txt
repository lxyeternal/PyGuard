  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is straightforward enum definitions for API extensions and add-ons. There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, network operations, or data processing. The code is static and purely declarative.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior. They also note the TODO comment indicating future refactoring, which is a standard development practice. No logical flaws or errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. These scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code contains no dynamic or executable logic, no external data handling, and no security-sensitive operations, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted. The reports' scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct given the code's nature. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as static enum definitions serving as configuration constants.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of enum constants for configuration purposes. No security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative in their scoring.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates** align with the reports:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code is safe and unremarkable from a security perspective.",
