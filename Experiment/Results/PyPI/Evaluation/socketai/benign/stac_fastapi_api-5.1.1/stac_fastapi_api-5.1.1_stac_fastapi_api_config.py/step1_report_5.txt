  "purpose": "Define enumerations for STAC API extensions and third-party add-ons",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external interactions are present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions for API extensions and add-ons, with descriptive comments. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or network interactions. The structure is straightforward and uses standard Python enum syntax. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of enumeration definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
