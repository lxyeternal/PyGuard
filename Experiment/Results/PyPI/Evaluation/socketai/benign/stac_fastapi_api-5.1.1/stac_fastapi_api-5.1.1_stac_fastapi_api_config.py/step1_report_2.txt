  "purpose": "Defines enumeration classes for API extensions and third-party add-ons related to a STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or data leaks occur in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only declares enums.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. Comments indicate potential future refactoring, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two enum classes for categorizing API extensions and add-ons, with no external data handling, user input, or network operations. The presence of comments suggests ongoing development but does not introduce any security concerns or malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and uses standard enum definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a configuration or constant declaration for API extensions and add-ons.",
