  "purpose": "Define enumerations for STAC API extensions and third-party add-ons",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static enum definitions",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output involved",
  "flows": "No data flow; static code with enum definitions",
  "anomalies": "Presence of TODO comment indicating future refactoring, but no malicious or suspicious code activities",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple enum class definitions for API extensions and add-ons with descriptive docstrings. No input handling, data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. The TODO comment suggests ongoing development or refactoring but does not introduce malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward, static, and typical for configuration or constant definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. It serves as a configuration or reference for enumerations. No anomalies or malicious indicators detected.",
