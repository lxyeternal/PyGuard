{
  "purpose": "Defines enumeration constants for available STAC API extensions and third-party add-ons.",
  "sources": "Static enum class definitions; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static constants only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward enum definitions with comments for future refactoring.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum classes with string constants, serving as configuration constants. There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, network communication, or data processing. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. Comments indicate future refactoring but do not introduce security concerns. The code is static and benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static declaration of enums for API extensions and add-ons. There are no security issues, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
