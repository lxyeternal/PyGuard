  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\n- The code consists solely of two enum classes: `ApiExtensions` and `AddOns`, each defining string constants.\n- There are no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, network communication, or data processing.\n- The comments indicate future refactoring plans, but currently, the code is static and straightforward.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The code is typical for configuration or constants definition.\n\n**Assessment of Reports:**\n\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security-sensitive content.\n- They note the absence of data flows, input handling, or external interactions.\n- The comments about future refactoring do not introduce any security concerns.\n- The confidence score is 1 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. The code is purely static enum definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0. The code does not pose any security risk; it’s a simple configuration.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n\n- No discrepancies are apparent; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is not dynamic or input-driven.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the static, benign nature of this code, the scores are appropriate. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard enum declaration for configuration purposes, with no security concerns.",
