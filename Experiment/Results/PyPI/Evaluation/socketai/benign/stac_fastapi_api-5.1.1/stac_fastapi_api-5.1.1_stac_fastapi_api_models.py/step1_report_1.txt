  "purpose": "Define API request/response models and utility functions for creating request models dynamically.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and functions that generate request models based on extensions and base models.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code creates models from extensions and base models, but does not process or handle untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code appears to be standard API model definitions and utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data models and functions to generate request schemas dynamically based on extensions and base models. It imports external libraries safely with fallback options. No dynamic execution of untrusted input, network activity, or system modifications are present. There are no obfuscated elements or signs of malicious intent. The code follows typical patterns for API schema definitions with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate API schema definition module with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is well-structured and uses standard libraries for model creation. No signs of malware or security issues are identified.",
