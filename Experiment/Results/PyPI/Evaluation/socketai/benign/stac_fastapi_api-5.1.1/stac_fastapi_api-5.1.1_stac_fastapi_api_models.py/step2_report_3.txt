  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines API models and utility functions for dynamic request model creation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The confidence is high (0.95), with malware score 0, and security risk very low (0.1).\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard for API schema definitions, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The reasoning appears sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the safe use of dynamic model creation, optional import of `orjson`, and extension-based models. No malicious behavior or security issues are identified. Confidence is 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough, correctly noting that external extension models could be a point of concern but are not inherently malicious. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on geospatial data models, extension models, and dynamic creation. No malicious code or suspicious patterns are found. External extensions could influence behavior but are not shown. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious intent is evident. The dynamic creation via extensions is standard and safe in this context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, highlighting safe model creation, extension handling, and no malicious activity. External extensions are noted but not malicious. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is appropriate; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is standard API modeling code with no malicious behavior. Confidence 0.95, malware 0, risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior findings; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is primarily data model definitions and utility functions for dynamic model creation. No direct execution of untrusted code, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's content. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the clear and straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns mostly related to external extensions influencing model creation, which is a common pattern in plugin architectures.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only theoretical concern is the external extension models influencing request schemas, but this is a typical pattern and does not inherently introduce malicious behavior unless the extensions themselves are malicious, which is outside the scope of this code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, mostly related to external extension trust)\n\n**The code appears safe, well-structured, and typical for API schema definitions. No signs of supply chain security issues or malicious behavior are present.**",
