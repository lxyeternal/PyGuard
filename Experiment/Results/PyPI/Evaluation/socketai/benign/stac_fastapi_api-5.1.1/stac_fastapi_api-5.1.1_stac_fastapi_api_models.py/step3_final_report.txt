{
  "purpose": "Defines API request/response models and utility functions for dynamic model creation, with no malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Path and query parameters, extension request models, optional 'orjson' import.",
  "sinks": "Potential extension models influencing request schemas, but no direct untrusted data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Extension models influence create_request_model, but no code executes untrusted input or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unsafe dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries (pydantic, attr, fastapi) for defining data models and dynamic creation functions. It safely uses optional 'orjson' for performance. Extension models are external and influence schema creation but are presumed trusted. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscated patterns are present. The dynamic model creation is based on predefined models and extensions, with no evidence of malicious payloads or behavior. The overall structure is typical for API schema modules, with minimal risk primarily due to external extension influence, which is a common pattern in plugin architectures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe API schema definition module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk score reflects potential external extension influence but does not indicate malicious intent.",
