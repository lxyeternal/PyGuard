{
  "purpose": "The code sets up error handling for a FastAPI application, defining how exceptions are caught and returned as JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.",
  "sources": "Exception classes imported from stac_fastapi.types.errors; exceptions passed into add_exception_handlers; exceptions handled within exception_handler_factory.",
  "sinks": "JSONResponse creation which outputs error details; logger.error call for exception logging.",
  "flows": "Exceptions occur during API request processing; caught by handlers; details are logged and returned in JSON format to clients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code properly handles exceptions and logs errors. No suspicious data flows or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines structured error responses, exception handling, and logging for a FastAPI application. It creates handlers for various custom exceptions and standard validation errors, returning JSON responses with status codes. No dynamic code execution, insecure data handling, or malicious behavior present. Logging is standard, and no suspicious external communication is evident. Overall, this appears to be a straightforward error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides standard, well-structured error handling for a FastAPI app without any signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It focuses on capturing and reporting errors properly, following best practices.",
