{
  "purpose": "This code provides exception handling and error response formatting for a FastAPI application, aligning with the STAC API spec.",
  "sources": "Reads from incoming HTTP requests (implicitly via FastAPI exception handling) and exception objects during runtime.",
  "sinks": "Generates JSON responses containing error codes and descriptions; logs errors.",
  "flows": "Exceptions raised during request processing are caught and mapped to JSON error responses with appropriate status codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code detected. The code handles exceptions gracefully and securely.",
  "analysis": "The code defines error handling functions and maps specific exceptions to HTTP status codes, then registers handlers with FastAPI. It logs errors securely without exposing sensitive data. The exception handlers produce JSON responses consistent with API specifications. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is present. The code does not perform any untrusted data processing, code injection, or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides standard and safe exception handling for a FastAPI application without any signs of malicious behavior. It operates solely within the expected bounds of error handling and logging, following best practices.",
