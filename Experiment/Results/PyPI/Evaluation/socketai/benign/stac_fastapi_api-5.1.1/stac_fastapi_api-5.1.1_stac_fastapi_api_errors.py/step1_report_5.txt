{
  "purpose": "Define and add exception handlers for a FastAPI application to standardize error responses according to the STAC API specification.",
  "sources": "The code reads exception classes, request data, and error details during exception handling.",
  "sinks": "The code returns JSON responses containing exception information; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks like system commands or files.",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught by handlers generate JSON responses with exception class names and messages; handlers are registered for specific exception types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a standard error handling mechanism for a FastAPI app, mapping exceptions to HTTP status codes. Exception handlers log errors and return JSON error responses with exception class names and messages. The request validation handler customizes validation error responses to align with API specifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data leaks. The code operates as expected for a typical error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward error handling module for FastAPI, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It correctly manages exceptions and error responses according to API standards.",
