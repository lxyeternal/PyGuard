  "purpose": "Establishes exception handling for a FastAPI application, mapping exceptions to HTTP status codes, logging errors, and returning structured JSON error responses.",
  "sources": "Exception objects, Request object, error messages, exception class names.",
  "sinks": "Logging errors, returning JSONResponse with error details and status codes.",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> exception handler logs error -> handler returns JSONResponse with error info.",
  "anomalies": "Exposes exception class names and messages, which could leak internal details but is common in error reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured error handling setup for FastAPI. It maps specific exceptions to HTTP status codes, logs errors, and returns JSON responses containing exception class names and messages. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The exposure of exception class names/messages could leak internal info but is a typical trade-off for detailed error responses. The implementation aligns with best practices, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe error handling module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor information leakage concern does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, it is a secure, well-implemented component suitable for production.",
