  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Standard exception handling setup with a factory function for handlers.  \n- Sources & sinks: Uses exception objects and request info; returns JSON responses with exception class names and messages.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns.  \n- Analysis & conclusion: Straightforward, safe, standard implementation. Minor concern about exposing exception class names, but this is common in API error responses and not malicious.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low, due to potential info leakage but not malicious).  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose & flow: Similar, with focus on error handling and exposing exception class names.  \n- Anomalies: Potential info leak via exception class names/messages.  \n- Analysis & conclusion: No malicious code, just standard error handling with minor info leakage concern.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose & flow: Standard error handling, logs errors, returns JSON responses.  \n- Anomalies: No malicious activity or suspicious patterns.  \n- Analysis & conclusion: Safe, aligned with best practices.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose & flow: Same as above, with proper exception mapping and logging.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard implementation.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose & flow: Standard error handling with exception-to-status code mapping.  \n- Anomalies: No malicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, straightforward.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.  \n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Minor info leakage by exposing exception class names and messages, but this is common in error responses and not inherently malicious.  \n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports.  \n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly related to information disclosure, not malicious intent.  \n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal info leakage and standard implementation, a risk score of around 0.1–0.2 is appropriate. The reports already assign 0.1–0.2, which seems reasonable.  \n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured error handling module for FastAPI, aligning with best practices.  \n- The only concern is the exposure of exception class names/messages, which is a common trade-off for detailed error reporting but not malicious.  \n- No evidence of backdoors, malicious code, or suspicious external calls.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is safe, standard, and does not contain malicious elements. The minor info leakage is a typical concern but not a security breach or malicious activity.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, reflecting minor info disclosure concern but no real security threat)",
