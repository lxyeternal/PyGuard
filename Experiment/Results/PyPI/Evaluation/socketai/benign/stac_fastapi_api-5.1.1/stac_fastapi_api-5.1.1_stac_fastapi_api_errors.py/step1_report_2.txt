{
  "purpose": "The code defines error handling mechanisms for a FastAPI application, including custom exception handlers and response formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads exception classes, request objects, and exception details from the runtime environment.",
  "sinks": "The code returns JSONResponse objects containing error details, potentially exposing exception class names and messages.",
  "flows": "Exception classes are mapped to status codes; upon exceptions, handlers generate JSON responses with exception class names and messages.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes the exception class name in the error response, which could leak internal implementation details. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. No evidence of malicious activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides structured error handling for a FastAPI app, translating exceptions into JSON responses with error details. It uses logging for exceptions, and custom handlers for specific error types. The exception handler factory generically logs and returns exception info, which could potentially leak sensitive internal exception names or messages if exceptions contain sensitive data. However, it does not include any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code is standard for error handling in web frameworks and does not appear to be obfuscated or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard, safe error handling for a FastAPI application. The only minor concern is exposing exception class names and messages in responses, which could leak internal details but does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears benign and not malicious.",
