  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of exception handling in a FastAPI app.\n- It maps custom exceptions to HTTP status codes, logs errors, and returns JSON error responses.\n- The error responses include exception class names and messages.\n- The code appears clean, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code.\n- The exception class name exposure could leak internal implementation details, but this is a common practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n\n- The code matches the description; no anomalies or suspicious logic are present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, code injection, or obfuscated code.\n- Exception handling is straightforward and standard.\n- The only minor concern is exposing exception class names and messages, which could leak internal info but is not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues or vulnerabilities detected in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, safe, and does not contain malicious behavior.\n- They note that exposing exception class names/messages could leak internal info but is not malicious.\n- No report claims malicious intent or malicious code, which aligns with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No logical flaws in the reports.\n\n---\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n\n- All reports assign `malware` score as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low (~0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the minimal information leakage concern.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- The `confidence` scores are high (0.9-1), appropriate for the clear, benign code.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem consistent and reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The only concern is information leakage via exception class names/messages, which is a common and generally acceptable practice.\n- The overall `securityRisk` is low (~0.1-0.2), aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No justification for higher risk scores; current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**5. Malware score:**\n\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- No dynamic code execution, external calls, or suspicious data handling.\n- The reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Malware score is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n\n- All reports avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they recognize standard error handling.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious activity are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n**Verdict:** No unwarranted assumptions detected.\n\n---\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score (Malware / Obfuscated / Risk) | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                                   | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                                   | Code is clear and straightforward.                            |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1 - 0.2                           | Minor info leakage concern, but generally safe.             |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of exception handling.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident.\n- The existing scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. No changes are necessary. The overall security posture of this code is benign.",
