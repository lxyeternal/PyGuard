{
  "purpose": "This code defines exception handling for a FastAPI web application, including custom handlers for various error types and a factory function to generate exception handlers.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from exception objects (exc), request objects, and the JSON encoder; no external or untrusted data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The exception handlers generate JSON responses that include exception class names and error messages. These could potentially leak internal exception details if untrusted input causes exceptions, but the message content is derived from exception objects, not user input.",
  "flows": "Exceptions raised during request processing are caught by handlers, which generate JSON responses containing exception class names and messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or malicious backdoors are present. The code properly logs errors, does not perform unsafe operations, and uses standard libraries for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes exception handling for a FastAPI application, with a factory function creating handlers that log errors and return JSON responses. The exception mappings are standard and do not contain suspicious data. The custom validation error handler returns validation errors without exposing sensitive data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or security bypasses. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of error handling conforming to API specifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and safe implementation of exception handling for a web API, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It correctly manages error responses and logs exceptions for debugging.",
