{
  "purpose": "Modify the OpenAPI route in a FastAPI application to ensure the response content-type header complies with the STAC API spec.",
  "sources": "Reads the app's routes, accesses the openapi endpoint, and calls the original openapi endpoint function.",
  "sinks": "Sets the 'content-type' header in the response to a specific value.",
  "flows": "Retrieves the original openapi endpoint -> calls it to get a response -> modifies the response headers -> returns the response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the header modification appears straightforward and intended.",
  "analysis": "The code locates the existing openapi route in the FastAPI app, wraps its endpoint to modify the 'content-type' header, and replaces the route's app with this patched version. No untrusted data handling, no system commands, no network activity, or obfuscated code present. The code's purpose is a simple middleware modification to ensure compliance with a specific API spec. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign modification of the OpenAPI route response headers. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard practice for API header adjustments.",
