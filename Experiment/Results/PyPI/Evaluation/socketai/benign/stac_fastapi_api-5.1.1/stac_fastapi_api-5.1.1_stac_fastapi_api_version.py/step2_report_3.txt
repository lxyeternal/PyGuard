  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. The code is straightforward and typical for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign and only serves as metadata declaration. No logical errors or suspicious reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is not obfuscated.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no external dependencies, inputs, or dynamic code, a security risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious activity—no obfuscation, no code injection, no network activity, or suspicious behavior. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that this is standard version declaration code.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; this code is benign.",
