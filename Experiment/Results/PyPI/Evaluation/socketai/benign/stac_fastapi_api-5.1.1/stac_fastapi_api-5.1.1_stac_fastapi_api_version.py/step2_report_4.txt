  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the simplicity of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The conclusion that this is a benign version declaration is correct.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is extremely simple, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n   - The risk score of 0 is justified; no reason to increase it.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code content.\n   - No malicious behavior detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code as standard metadata declaration.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, standard version string assignment.\n- No security issues, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's benign nature.",
