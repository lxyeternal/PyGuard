  "purpose": "Declare the version of the library/package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice for version declaration. It contains no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern indicate benign intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and have high confidence in this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
