  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code; only a version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment setting __version__ to '5.1.1'. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external calls, or any suspicious constructs. It is a typical pattern for Python packages to declare version info in this manner. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
