  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to the `__version__` variable. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. The code is minimal and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious activity. No logical errors or flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct, code is clear)\n   - `malware`: 0 (correct, no malicious code)\n   - `securityRisk`: 0 (appropriate, no security concerns)\n   - `confidence`: 1 (justified, straightforward assessment)\n\n   These scores are reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are 0, there's no need to justify higher risk scores. The code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign `malware` = 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   No suspicious claims are made; the analysis is based on observable code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (code is clear, straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard version declaration, a common pattern in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Summary**:  \nI agree with the assessments provided. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Security risk score: **0**",
