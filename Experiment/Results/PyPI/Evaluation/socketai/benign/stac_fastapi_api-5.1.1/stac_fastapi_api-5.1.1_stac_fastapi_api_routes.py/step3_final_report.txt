  "purpose": "Utility functions for route creation, dependency injection, response wrapping, and async handling in FastAPI.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, request objects, route configurations, and dependency injection points.",
  "sinks": "Execution of run_in_threadpool, dependency injection into routes, and response generation.",
  "flows": "Input data from request or dependencies flows into endpoint functions; responses are wrapped and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard FastAPI and Starlette patterns for async execution, dependency injection, and route management. No external network activity, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The functions are straightforward, with clear intent and safe practices. Dependency injection is handled via established methods, and response wrapping is standard. No anomalies or obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard utility code for FastAPI applications, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use, with a very low security risk primarily due to the potential for misuse in untrusted contexts, but no evidence of malicious intent.",
