  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions for route creation, dependency injection, and response wrapping. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — justified as low, given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence based on thorough review.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusions are reasonable and consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard FastAPI utilities, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — justified as very low.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code, which is standard utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard FastAPI route and dependency management, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — still low, considering the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for async endpoints and route dependencies, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusions are sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for route creation, dependency injection, response wrapping, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The malware score should be **0** across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; scores are appropriate at **0**.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the consistent findings and the code's straightforward utility purpose, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no signs of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal risk, mainly due to potential misuse in untrusted contexts, but inherently low)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The code is standard FastAPI utility code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are, with perhaps a slight reduction in the overall risk score to reflect the very low inherent risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Confirm the scores as they are, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1).",
