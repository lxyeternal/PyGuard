{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for creating FastAPI endpoints, managing route dependencies, and handling request/response wrapping.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from function parameters, request objects, and route configurations.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to run_in_threadpool, dynamic dependency injection into routes, and return of endpoint responses.",
  "flows": "Input data (via request parameters or models) flows into endpoint functions, which may be run asynchronously. Data from dependencies is integrated into route handling. Responses are wrapped and returned to clients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The use of run_in_threadpool is standard for async wrapping. Dependency injection is handled via standard FastAPI methods. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for wrapping synchronous functions into async ones, creating API endpoints with flexible request models, and adding dependencies to routes. It leverages standard FastAPI and Starlette mechanisms without any suspicious or malicious modifications. No hardcoded secrets, external network connections, or code injection points are evident. The approach appears to be standard and intended for flexible API route management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, standard FastAPI utility code for route and dependency management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this code segment.",
