{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for creating FastAPI endpoints, managing routes, and adding dependencies dynamically.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, request objects, and route scopes. It also inspects function types and class hierarchies.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the invocation of functions with untrusted input data, dynamic injection of dependencies into routes, and execution of potentially user-controlled functions.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input data (request_data) flows into endpoint functions via dependency injection; route dependencies are dynamically inserted into route objects; function type inspection influences execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspiciously obfuscated code. Usage of async wrappers and dynamic route dependency injection appears standard for FastAPI applications. No malicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard FastAPI route and dependency management functionalities, including wrapping sync functions for async execution, creating endpoints with flexible request models, and adding dependencies post route definition. The use of 'inspect' for type checking and deep copying scopes is typical. No obfuscated code, hidden network calls, or malicious data handling observed. The dependency injection logic aligns with FastAPI best practices. There is no evidence of code designed to perform malicious activities such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage. The code appears to facilitate flexible API route configuration securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for FastAPI route management and dependency injection without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities based on this review.",
