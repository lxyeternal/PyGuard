{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for creating FastAPI endpoints, handling route dependencies, and converting sync functions to async, primarily to facilitate API route setup and request handling.",
  "sources": "Input sources include incoming HTTP requests, function parameters, and dependency injection via FastAPI's Depends.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are function executions (which could execute malicious code if the functions are malicious), and the extension of route dependencies which could inject malicious dependencies.",
  "flows": "Input from HTTP requests flows into endpoint functions through dependencies; data is processed within endpoint wrappers; dependencies are added to routes; function calls may execute with these data inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors observed. The use of copy.deepcopy and dependency injection aligns with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for wrapping responses, converting sync functions to async, creating endpoints with flexible request models, and adding dependencies to routes. The functions use standard Python and FastAPI patterns without suspicious constructs. No indications of malicious behavior such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code's dependency injection and route modification logic are typical for web frameworks. Overall, it appears to be standard utility code for API route management, with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a typical implementation of FastAPI route utilities without any malicious behavior. It provides flexible endpoint creation and route dependency management. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code is safe based on the provided snippet.",
