  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports CreateContextCallback from pytest_playwright and exposes it via __all__ for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pytest_playwright.pytest_playwright",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external system interactions present",
  "flows": "Import of CreateContextCallback (source) to module namespace (sink), then exported via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, includes licensing comments, and performs a simple import/export",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a class from an external library and exposes it. It contains no dynamic code, data processing, or system calls. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is to set up a test environment, and all signals indicate benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of security issues or malicious intent. The existing reports correctly assess it as safe, with no need for modifications. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
