  "purpose": "The code exports a single class or function related to pytest-playwright, likely used for creating or managing browser contexts in tests.",
  "sources": "Imports the CreateContextCallback class/function from the pytest_playwright.pytest_playwright module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flow points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Imports from an external library, then re-exports the class/function; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and standard for a testing utility. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports a class or function from an external library and exposes it via __all__. It includes licensing information, standard license boilerplate, and a simple export list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code's structure and content are consistent with legitimate open-source library code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign and standard module that re-exports an imported class/function. It does not contain malware or security risks. The license and structure indicate it is part of a legitimate open-source project, with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
