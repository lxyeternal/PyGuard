{
  "purpose": "The code exports a specific callback class for use with pytest-playwright, likely as part of a testing framework setup.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pytest_playwright.pytest_playwright' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no system calls, network connections, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import is static and used for test setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard licensing comments, straightforward import, and export statement",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing comments and imports a class from an external testing library. It then exposes this class via __all__, which is a standard pattern for module exports. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a simple module setup for test configuration, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and intended for test setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
