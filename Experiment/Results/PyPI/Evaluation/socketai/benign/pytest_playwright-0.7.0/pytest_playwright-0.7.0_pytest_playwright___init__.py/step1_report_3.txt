  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a simple import and export statement with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing information, imports a specific class, and defines an __all__ list to specify public interface. No user input handling, data processing, or network operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply imports and re-exports a class with licensing headers.",
