  "purpose": "Expose the public interface of a module that imports a specific class from a third-party library.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing CreateContextCallback from pytest_playwright.pytest_playwright.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks present in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code includes standard licensing and import statements, with no obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with licensing information, which is standard. It then imports a class from a third-party library 'pytest_playwright'. The __all__ declaration exposes only this class, indicating the module's interface. There are no variables, functions, or code execution that could be malicious. The code appears to be a straightforward module definition intended for use as part of a testing framework. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard module exposing a class from an external library with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain any hidden or suspicious behavior.",
