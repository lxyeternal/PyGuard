{
  "purpose": "The code provides fixtures and utilities for browser automation testing using Playwright and pytest, managing browser contexts, artifacts (screenshots, videos, traces), and configurations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, pytest command-line options, filesystem for saving artifacts, and network connections for remote browser control.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem writes for screenshots, videos, traces; network connections via Playwright's connect method for remote browsers.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and options influence filesystem operations and network connections; artifacts are saved to disk, and network connections are established for remote browsers.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. GUIDs generated with os.urandom() are standard. No hidden network activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured test infrastructure for browser automation, managing artifacts and browser contexts with exception handling. It uses standard practices for GUID generation and resource cleanup. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and the logic aligns with typical testing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, reflecting minimal security concern appropriate for test infrastructure.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
