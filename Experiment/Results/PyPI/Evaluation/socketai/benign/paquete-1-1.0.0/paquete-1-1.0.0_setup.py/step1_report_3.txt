  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with custom install and develop commands that execute obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string in b64d function, executed via os.system in notmalfunc(), called during install process.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded code from base64 string, potentially running arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During package installation, notmalfunc() is called, decoding base64 string and executing it via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64 decoding function and execution of decoded code in install routine, but the base64 string is empty, indicating possible placeholder or malicious code insertion.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines functions for base64 decoding and executing code via os.system. The notmalfunc() function calls os.system with the decoded string from b64d, but the string is empty. During the install process, notmalfunc() is invoked, which would execute whatever code is provided in the base64 string. The class AfterInstall overrides the run method to call notmalfunc(), thus executing decoded code at install time. This pattern is suspicious because it could allow arbitrary code execution if the base64 string is replaced with malicious code. The setup configuration appears normal otherwise, but the core concern is the potential for malicious code execution during install due to the obfuscated code execution mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious pattern where arbitrary code can be injected into the base64 string and executed during installation. Although the current string is empty, this structure could be exploited for malicious purposes. The overall design is suspicious and warrants caution.",
