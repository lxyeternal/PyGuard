  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that includes hooks for post-install and post-develop actions, potentially executing hidden code.",
  "sources": "b64d function decoding base64 string; notmalfunc function executing os.system with decoded string",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded code, which can run arbitrary commands",
  "flows": "b64d decodes base64 string -> notmalfunc executes os.system with decoded code",
  "anomalies": "Empty base64 string in b64d function, which suggests either incomplete or malicious placeholder code; use of os.system with dynamically decoded code is suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, with custom classes for post-installation and post-develop hooks. The notmalfunc function decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system. However, the base64 string is empty, meaning no code will be executed at this point. This could be a placeholder or an attempt to hide malicious code. The structure suggests an ability to execute arbitrary code during installation, which is a security concern if the base64 string were populated. Overall, the code itself does not contain active malicious payloads but has the potential to do so if the base64 string is filled with malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a mechanism to execute arbitrary code during package installation via base64 decoding and os.system call. Currently, the base64 string is empty, indicating no active malicious payload. However, the structure is suspicious and could be exploited to run malicious code if properly populated. Caution is advised if this package is used or modified.",
