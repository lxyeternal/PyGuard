  "conclusion": "The code pattern is designed to facilitate arbitrary code execution during package installation, representing a significant security risk. Although the current base64 string is empty, the structure is suspicious and could be exploited to run malicious code. The high malware and risk scores are justified by this potential. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised, and caution is advised in its use."
