{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the implementation of a Python package for general functionality, with no clear indication of malicious intent based on the visible code.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, possibly for configuration or credentials; also reads input data via function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., sending data over sockets or HTTP requests), file writes, or executing system commands if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs through processing functions to sinks such as network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual or suspicious code patterns observed; code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a standard Python module with functions and imports. It uses environment variables and input arguments responsibly. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, suspicious network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No embedded or obfuscated malicious payloads are evident. The overall code is clean and aligns with typical open-source packages.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe, with no suspicious patterns or malicious actions detected.",
