  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external data sources, network endpoints, environment variables storing secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Input data from sources to sinks via code execution, network transmission, or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic code execution (eval/exec), obfuscation patterns, suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, unusual data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for typical malicious indicators such as dynamic code execution, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, and insecure data handling. Benign code showed straightforward data processing, environment variable usage, and no suspicious patterns. Malicious indicators included eval/exec with untrusted input, obfuscated code, suspicious network endpoints, and environment variables with secrets. The benign code had no anomalies, while the malicious code exhibited clear malicious behaviors. The source-to-sink flow analysis confirmed suspicious patterns in the malicious case. The overall assessment aligns with the described behaviors, with scores reflecting the likelihood of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code in the benign reports shows no signs of malicious activity, with scores appropriately set to zero for malware and obfuscation, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2). The malicious report exhibits strong indicators such as dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and suspicious network activity, warranting high malware (0.8-0.9), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk scores (~0.9). The assessments are consistent, justified, and align with standard security evaluation practices.",
