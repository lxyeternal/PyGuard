  "sinks": "No sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system modifications are evident from the provided input.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from sources to sinks is present without the code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are observable due to lack of actual code content.",
  "analysis": "The input contains no code to analyze, so no step-by-step security assessment can be performed. Without code, it is impossible to identify sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review; therefore, no malicious behavior or security issues can be identified. The absence of code means there's no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
