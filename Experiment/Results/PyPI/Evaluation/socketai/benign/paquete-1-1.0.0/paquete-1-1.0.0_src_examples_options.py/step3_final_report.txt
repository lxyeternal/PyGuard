  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, file reads, user input, and dynamic imports.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network calls, file writing, environment variable access, and logging.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables, files) to sinks (network, file system, logs) without evidence of malicious manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign scripts with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the descriptions. Risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal threat. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code details. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code in all reports appears safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the assessments are consistent with the provided descriptions.",
