  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package as a source of truth.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ from a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A, simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a version string and a copyright comment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, which is standard in Python packages for version control. The comment indicates authorship but contains no executable or sensitive data. There are no input sources, data handling, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It contains no security risks or anomalies beyond typical package metadata.",
