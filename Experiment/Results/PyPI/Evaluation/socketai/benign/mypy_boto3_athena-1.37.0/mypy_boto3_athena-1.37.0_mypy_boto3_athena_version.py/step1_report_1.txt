  "purpose": "Defines a version string as a source of truth for the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable with a static string \"1.37.0\".",
  "sinks": "None; no data input or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors observed; simple version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a copyright statement, followed by setting a version string variable. It contains no dynamic code, no input/output operations, and no external data handling. The version is hardcoded, which is common practice for source control. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a static metadata marker without any potential for malicious activity.",
