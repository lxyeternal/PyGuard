  "purpose": "Declare the version of the package using a static string assignment.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string to __version__, with a copyright comment. It contains no dynamic code, input/output, external data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, standard practice for version metadata. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is solely to serve as a version marker, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no malicious or obfuscated content. The reports and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
