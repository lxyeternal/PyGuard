  "purpose": "Main interface for the Athena service, providing access to paginators and client initialization.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), static assignment of Client to AthenaClient.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no user input or environment variables are read.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules and assigns a class to a variable, serving as a public interface. No dynamic code execution, no network connections, or sensitive data handling present. It appears to be a straightforward module defining an API interface without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple interface module for AWS Athena, consisting of imports, a class alias, and exports. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe and standard.",
