{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface and documentation for AWS Athena client and paginators, serving as a structural wrapper for SDK components.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), static class and function definitions, and documentation strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external input, output, or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Static imports and class aliasing without runtime data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the only minor anomaly is the future copyright year 2025, which is likely a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes related to AWS Athena, assigns an alias, and defines __all__ for public API exposure. The documentation provides usage examples with boto3 but does not execute any dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it is a benign SDK interface component. All security and malware scores are appropriately zero, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured Python interface module for AWS Athena SDK components, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
