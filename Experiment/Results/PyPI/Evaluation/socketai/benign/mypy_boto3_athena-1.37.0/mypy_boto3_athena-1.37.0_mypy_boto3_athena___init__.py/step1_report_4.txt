{
  "purpose": "Main interface for the Athena service, providing access to the Athena client and various paginators for querying data.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module (.client and .paginator). No external data sources or user inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or outputs; the code solely defines imports, class alias, and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not process or handle external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The license and comments are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining an interface and re-exporting classes for Athena client and paginators. No data input handling, no network connections, and no suspicious operations are present. It appears to be a standard, well-structured module setup for a Python SDK wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK module interface with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports and re-exports classes for external use.",
