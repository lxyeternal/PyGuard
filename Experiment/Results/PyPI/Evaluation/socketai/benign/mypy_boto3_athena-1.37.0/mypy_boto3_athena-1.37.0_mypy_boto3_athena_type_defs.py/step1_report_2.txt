{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the Athena service in Python, providing clear schema definitions for various request, response, and data types used in the SDK.",
  "sources": "Constant imports from __future__, sys.version_info checks for conditional imports, external literals and typing modules, type definitions via TypedDict and Union, attribute assignments, and __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily consists of type definitions and constants, with no data processing, external network calls, or data handling that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows are present; the code only establishes static type schemas without data or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code is straightforward type definition for data schemas, with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for the Athena SDK, leveraging Python typing constructs for clarity and compatibility across Python versions. It conditionally imports typing modules based on Python version to ensure compatibility, and uses TypedDict for structured data. There is no code executing logic, network activity, or data manipulation beyond static type declarations. No malicious or suspicious patterns are observed, and the code appears to be purely declarative with a focus on type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of static type annotations and data schemas for Athena SDK in Python. It contains no executable or network code, no embedded data, and no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It serves as a type declaration library, and is safe and non-malicious.",
