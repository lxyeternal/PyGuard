  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely static type definitions for AWS Athena data structures, with no runtime logic or external communication.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is accurate; the code is a schema declaration, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Security risk is correctly marked as 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report emphasizes that the code is a set of type annotations and data structures, with no executable logic or external data handling.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is correct; the code is static, with conditional imports for compatibility, and no runtime or external communication.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 is justified. Security risk is correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and purely declarative.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, it notes that the code is static type definitions with no runtime or data processing.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code contains only type annotations, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Security risk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, it highlights that the code is purely static type annotations and data schemas, with no runtime logic.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 and security risk of 0 are correct.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard type definition module.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report correctly states that the code is a collection of type annotations for Athena data schemas, with no runtime or data processing.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is correct; the code is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 is justified. Security risk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and standard.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code contains only static type annotations, data schemas, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Malware & security risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Potential concerns:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, data leaks, or external communication are present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward type definitions)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe set of type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Athena SDK in Python. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious behavior or code obfuscation detected.        |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Code is clear, static, and straightforward.                 |\n| Risk           | 0                 | No security vulnerabilities or data leaks present.         |\n\nThis confirms the code's safety and the correctness of the reports.",
