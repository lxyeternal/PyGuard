{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Athena service in Python, used for type checking and API interactions.",
  "sources": "Constant imports from literals and typing modules; data definitions mainly in the form of TypedDict classes; no external input reading or data ingestion points.",
  "sinks": "None detected—no data is sent over the network, written to files, or processed in an unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data; the code only defines static types and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. Use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice; no obfuscation or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises only type annotations and data structure definitions for the Athena SDK, which are static constructs. No code executes logic or processes external data. The conditional imports for Python version compatibility are typical for type hinting, and all classes and variables serve as type definitions. No signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely for type checking and data modeling purposes, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, standard type definitions module for AWS Athena in Python.",
