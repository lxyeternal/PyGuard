  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data flow, anomalies, and overall security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations for Athena data structures.  \n- Analysis: The report correctly identifies that this module is purely static, defining data schemas with no runtime logic or external communication. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: The code is safe, static, and serves as a type definition library.  \n- Malware Score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk Score: 0 (no security concern)\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations and data structures for Athena SDK.  \n- Analysis: The module only contains static type definitions, with conditional imports for compatibility. No runtime code, external calls, or data handling. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, purely declarative, no malicious intent.  \n- Malware Score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk Score: 0\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations for Athena API data structures.  \n- Analysis: The code is static, only defining data schemas with no runtime logic or external data processing. No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard type annotations.  \n- Malware Score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk Score: 0\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations for Athena service data structures.  \n- Analysis: No runtime code, external communication, or data ingestion. The module is purely for static type checking. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard type definitions.  \n- Malware Score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk Score: 0\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations for Athena SDK data schemas.  \n- Analysis: Entirely static, no runtime logic, no external data handling, no obfuscation.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard type annotations.  \n- Malware Score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk Score: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that this module is purely static type definitions with no executable logic.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code's purpose is solely to provide type annotations for static analysis, IDE support, and type safety.\n\n### Final Security Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk associated with static type definitions)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The conditional imports based on Python version are standard practice for compatibility.\n- The extensive use of TypedDict and type annotations aligns with best practices for SDK type safety.\n- No data leaks, secrets, or external communication are embedded or implied.\n\n**Overall, this code is a safe, well-structured static type definitions module with no malicious or security concerns.**",
