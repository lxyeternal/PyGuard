{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations and data schemas for AWS Athena SDK in Python, primarily using TypedDict and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It serves as a schema for data validation, IDE support, and type safety, with no runtime logic or external communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads data only from type annotations, constants, and import statements; no external data sources or runtime input handling are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; the module contains only type definitions without data flow or external effects.",
  "flows": "The code is purely static; there are no data flows from sources to sinks, no executable logic, or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code follows standard practices for type annotations and compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The module consists solely of TypedDict class definitions, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and extensive type annotations for AWS Athena data structures. There is no executable code, network activity, or data ingestion. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to best practices for static type declaration in Python SDKs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The conditional import logic is standard for compatibility and does not introduce any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a safe, standard set of static type annotations for the AWS Athena SDK in Python. It contains no executable logic, external communication, or secrets. All assessments and reports correctly identify its benign, declarative nature. The code poses no security threat, and the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all zero.",
