  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, logical consistency, and potential security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code is solely type definitions for Athena SDK.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or executable code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that the code is static, purely declarative, and safe.\n- **Security & Malware:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is correct. The code is a static type schema with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; defines type annotations for Athena.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime data processing; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely static type definitions, with careful use of conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Security & Malware:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. The code is safe and serves as a type schema.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; focuses on static type annotations.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or external communication.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly identifies the code as static, non-executable, and safe.\n- **Security & Malware:** No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is appropriate. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; type annotations for Athena.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime logic or data ingestion.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the absence of executable code, external communication, or obfuscation.\n- **Security & Malware:** No signs of malware or security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is valid and thorough.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; static type definitions.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data processing or external data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states that the code is purely for type annotations with no malicious behavior.\n- **Security & Malware:** No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that this module contains only static type definitions.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Logical flaws or reasoning issues:** None. All reports correctly interpret the purpose and nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risks, no executable code or external communication)\n\nThis module is a straightforward, well-structured set of static type annotations for the AWS Athena SDK, serving as a schema for data validation and IDE support.\n\n**Conclusion:** No modifications needed. The code is safe, clean, and purely declarative.",
