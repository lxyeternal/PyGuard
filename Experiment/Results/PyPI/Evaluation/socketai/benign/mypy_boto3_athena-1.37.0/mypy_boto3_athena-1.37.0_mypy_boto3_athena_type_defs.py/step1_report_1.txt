{
  "purpose": "Define detailed type annotations for AWS Athena service data structures and API operations for type safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions, imported modules, type annotations, and data structure definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if untrusted data is improperly handled in application logic; no direct data sink in this code.",
  "flows": "Data is primarily defined statically; no dynamic data flows or untrusted data sources are present in this module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No code that executes or communicates externally; only type definitions.",
  "analysis": "This module strictly contains type annotations, data structure definitions, and imports used for type checking in a larger codebase. It imports only standard libraries and type extension modules. No functions, no runtime code, and no external communications are present. All data structures are static definitions with no executable logic. The use of 'Literal', 'NotRequired', and 'TypedDict' aligns with type hinting best practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The module serves as a schema for data exchanged with the Athena API and does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a purely structural, static, and safe definition of types for Athena service API data. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or sabotage. It is a standard type definition module with no malicious behaviors.",
