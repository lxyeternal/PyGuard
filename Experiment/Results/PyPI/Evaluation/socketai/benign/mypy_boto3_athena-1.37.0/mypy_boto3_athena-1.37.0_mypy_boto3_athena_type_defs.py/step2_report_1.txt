  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and assess the potential security implications, consistency, and correctness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that this module is purely static type definitions, with no runtime logic, external communication, or data handling. It notes the use of `TypedDict`, conditional imports, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion states that the code is safe, purely structural, and non-malicious, with high confidence.\n\n- **Assessment:** This is accurate. The code contains only type annotations and data schemas, with no executable logic or external data processing. No malware or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is static type annotations for the Athena SDK, with careful handling of Python version compatibility, and no runtime or external data handling.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states that the code is safe, static, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates that the code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions, with no runtime code, data ingestion, or external communication. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid. The code is a standard type declaration module.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar observations: static type annotations, no runtime logic, no external data handling, no obfuscation, no suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a legitimate type definitions module, safe for use.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, the code is only type annotations and data schemas, with no executable or external communication code. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct assessment.\n\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent and correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there are no malicious behaviors, no external code execution, no embedded secrets, and no suspicious patterns. The malware score should be **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex dynamic constructs. Obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely static type definitions with no runtime logic or data handling, the overall security risk is minimal. The risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Item                | Final Score |\n|---------------------|--------------|\n| Malware             | 0             |\n| Obfuscated          | 0             |\n| Risk                | 0             |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis module is a safe, standard set of static type annotations for AWS Athena SDK in Python. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious code, and is purely declarative. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.",
