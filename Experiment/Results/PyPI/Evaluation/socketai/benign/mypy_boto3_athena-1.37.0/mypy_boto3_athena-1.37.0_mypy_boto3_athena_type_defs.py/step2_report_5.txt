  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for Athena data structures; sourced from documentation, constants, and imports.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or external communication; purely static type definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The module is solely for static type safety, with no executable code, network activity, or malicious behavior. It uses standard practices like TypedDict, conditional imports, and type literals.\n- **Security assessment:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations and data schemas.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Static definitions only; no runtime or data processing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations for Athena SDK, with no executable logic or external data handling. No malicious patterns are detected.\n- **Security assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; safe. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines Athena API data structures for static type checking.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Static, no data flow or external communication.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Strictly type definitions, no runtime code, no suspicious constructs. It’s a standard pattern for SDK type annotations.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious activity or security risks. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on type annotations, with imports and TypedDict classes.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No runtime logic, no data ingestion.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static data schemas only, no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Security assessment:** No signs of malicious intent. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others—type annotations for Athena SDK.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or runtime code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely static type definitions, standard practices, no malicious patterns.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious behavior detected. Confidence is high (1).\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, and the code is purely static type definitions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of executable code, external data handling, or secrets, the security risk is minimal.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a comprehensive set of static type annotations, essential for type safety in Python SDKs.\n- It employs standard typing practices, conditional imports for compatibility, and no runtime or external communication.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The entire module is a safe, standard, and well-structured type definition library for AWS Athena SDK in Python. It poses no security risks or malicious threats.",
