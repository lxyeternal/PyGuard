{
  "purpose": "Define detailed type annotations for Athena service data structures to facilitate type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code primarily reads type annotations and constants from imported modules and defines various TypedDict classes and Union types for data schemas.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data handling at runtime.",
  "flows": "The code establishes data type schemas but does not include any data flow logic or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code consists solely of type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive collection of type annotations using TypedDict for defining data structures used by the Athena service. It imports constants and type definitions, conditionally imports from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, and sets up all data schemas for use elsewhere. There are no runtime operations, no untrusted data inputs, nor any code execution. The structure and format are typical for type definition modules, and no obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a type definition library for Athena SDK data schemas. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external data handling that could be malicious. It is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
