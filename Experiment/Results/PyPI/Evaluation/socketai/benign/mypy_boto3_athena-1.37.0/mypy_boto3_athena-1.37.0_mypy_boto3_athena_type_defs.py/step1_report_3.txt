{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for Athena service API data structures, aiding static type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions, imports from standard libraries and type extension packages, and defines numerous TypedDict classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or execution points; all code consists of type definitions and imports without runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or execution flows are present; all are static type definitions without runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior is present. The code strictly defines data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static importation of modules, conditional imports based on Python version, and extensive declaration of TypedDict classes for various Athena API request and response types. All definitions are type annotations, not executable logic, with no network, file I/O, or runtime commands. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious patterns are observed. It is purely a type definition module aiding static analysis and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for Athena API structures, with no malicious activity, no runtime code, and no security risks. It serves as a type annotation aid for static analysis and code correctness.",
