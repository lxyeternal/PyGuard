  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The script is a straightforward CLI utility that displays static package information or version number based on command-line arguments.\n   - It reads `sys.argv` to determine if `--version` is present.\n   - It writes output to `sys.stdout` using `sys.stdout.write`.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, no network activity, no file manipulations, and no handling of untrusted input beyond command-line arguments.\n   - The code is minimal, clear, and contains no obfuscation or signs of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Reported Issues & Analysis:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no malicious code.\n   - They highlight the absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or external data fetching.\n   - The only minor anomaly noted is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is likely a typo or placeholder but not security relevant.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified because the code does not perform any risky operations or handle untrusted data maliciously.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No suspicious logic or assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n   - The code's purpose is purely informational, and there's no indication of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which could be a typo or placeholder but doesn't impact security.\n   - The code does not process any input that could be exploited.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign, minimal CLI utility.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified.\n   - No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**This aligns with the analysis that the code is harmless and serves a simple informational purpose.**",
