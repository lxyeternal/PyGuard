  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Logic Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that displays static package information or version based on command-line argument `--version`.\n   - It reads `sys.argv` for input, writes to `sys.stdout`, and contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or file handling.\n   - The code is minimal, with no obfuscation or complex logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - They mention the copyright year 2025 as a minor anomaly, but this does not impact security.\n   - No false positives or overlooked issues are evident.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, indicating no risk.\n   - This is justified because the code performs only static information display with no malicious activities.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0.\n   - Correct, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code.\n   \n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   \n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The only minor anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is likely a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security.\n- The code's purpose is purely informational, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
