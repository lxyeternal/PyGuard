  "purpose": "Display static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument '--version' in sys.argv",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs",

  "anomalies": "Copyright year 2025 (future date, likely a placeholder)",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static information based on command-line input. It reads sys.argv for '--version' and writes to stdout. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious logic. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, performing a simple informational task with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
