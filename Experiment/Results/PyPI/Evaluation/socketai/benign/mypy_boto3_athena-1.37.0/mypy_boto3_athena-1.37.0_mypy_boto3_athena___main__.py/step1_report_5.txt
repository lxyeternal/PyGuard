  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package, including version and documentation details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs information)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs package info and version)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() is called, outputting package details",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Code is straightforward and mainly outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script with functions to print static package info and version. It reads command-line arguments and writes to standard output without processing untrusted input or performing network operations. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The presence of copyright date 2025 is a minor anomaly, but it does not impact security or suggest malicious intent. Overall, the script appears benign and purposefully designed for informational output only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and content suggest it is a standard entrypoint script with no suspicious activity.",
