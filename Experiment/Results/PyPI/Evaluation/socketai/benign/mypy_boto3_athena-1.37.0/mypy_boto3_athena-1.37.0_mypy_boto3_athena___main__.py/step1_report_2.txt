  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "User input in sys.argv can trigger print_version(), which writes version info to stdout. Otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation detected. Usage of standard library functions is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple command-line interface that outputs package info or version based on arguments. It does not accept or process untrusted data beyond command-line arguments, which are standard. No network connections, data exfiltration, or code execution are present. No suspicious behaviors or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
