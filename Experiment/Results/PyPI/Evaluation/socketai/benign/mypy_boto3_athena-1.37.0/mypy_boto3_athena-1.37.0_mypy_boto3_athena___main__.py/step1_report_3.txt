  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input arguments, sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data, but no untrusted data processing occurs",
  "flows": "Input argument '--version' triggers print_version, otherwise print_info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures; straightforward info display",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details. It reads input arguments from sys.argv and outputs to stdout using sys.stdout.write. No user-supplied or untrusted input is processed in a dangerous way, and there are no network operations, file modifications, or system commands executed. The code is clean, well-structured, and performs a basic informational task without any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility for displaying package info and version number. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behavior, and poses no security risks.",
