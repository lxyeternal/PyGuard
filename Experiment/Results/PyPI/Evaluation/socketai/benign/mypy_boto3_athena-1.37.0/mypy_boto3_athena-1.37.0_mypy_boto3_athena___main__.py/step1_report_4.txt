  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version output; otherwise, print_info is called.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code; code is straightforward and typical for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The script defines simple functions to output package info and version details. It processes command-line arguments to determine which info to display. No external data fetching, network activity, or code execution based on untrusted input is present. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script that outputs package information and version details. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
