  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version, otherwise print_info",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple CLI functions: displaying package info or version based on command-line arguments. It reads input from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout. No untrusted input processing, no network activity, no file handling, and no secret management observed. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The code is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. It serves a utility purpose only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply displays static package information and version details without any suspicious logic.",
