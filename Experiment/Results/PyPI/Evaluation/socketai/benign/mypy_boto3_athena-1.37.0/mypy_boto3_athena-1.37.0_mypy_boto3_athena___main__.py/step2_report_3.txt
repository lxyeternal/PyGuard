  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a straightforward CLI utility that displays static package information or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It uses standard library functions (`sys.argv`, `sys.stdout.write`) with no untrusted input processing, network activity, or code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code is minimal, clean, and purpose-specific.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as intended; no issues are present.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None; the script only outputs static information based on command-line input.\n\n### Review of the reports:\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify the code's purpose and the absence of risky operations.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is accurate.\n- The malware scores are 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n### Scores justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is benign and does not process untrusted data or perform risky operations, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Potential points of contention:\n- The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future relative to current dates. This could be an anomaly, but it doesn't imply maliciousness.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made, which is correct given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign CLI utility with no security risks or malicious behavior.** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** I would not recommend any changes to the scores based on the provided information. The code is straightforward, and the reports correctly identify its benign nature.",
