  "purpose": "Define Python type annotations for AWS Athena service literals and related constants to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for various AWS Athena and other AWS service string values.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is purely static type definitions and constant literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code solely consists of static literals and import statements with version-based conditional import.",
  "analysis": "The code provides string literal type definitions for AWS Athena and other AWS services, enabling type checking in Python projects. The conditional import of 'Literal' depending on Python version is standard for compatibility. There are no dynamic data handling, user inputs, or network operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The code contains only static definitions, with proper annotations and no obfuscated or malicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward set of static type definitions for AWS service literals, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears to be a harmless utility module designed for type safety and clarity in Python codebases.",
