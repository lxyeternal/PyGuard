  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scores, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining string literal types for AWS service identifiers, states, and pagination names.\n- It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No data processing, input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated/malicious code patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is to provide type annotations for static type checking, enhancing code clarity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; defines type annotations with no external data handling.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity, just static definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar reasoning; static literals for AWS Athena and other services.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focused on AWS Athena literals; no dynamic code or external interactions.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Static type definitions for AWS services; no external or untrusted data.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar static definitions, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Security risk:** The code contains only static type annotations and constants, with no external interactions or vulnerabilities; scores of 0 are correct.\n- **Confidence:** All reports have high confidence (1), which aligns with the straightforward static nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed review, **the code is a well-structured static type annotations module for AWS service literals.** It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, static, and serves as a utility for type safety. No security threats or malicious activity are present.",
