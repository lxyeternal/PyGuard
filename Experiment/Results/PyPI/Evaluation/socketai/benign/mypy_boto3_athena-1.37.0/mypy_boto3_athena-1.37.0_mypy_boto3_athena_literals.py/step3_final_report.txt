  "purpose": "Defines static string literal types for AWS service identifiers, states, and constants to facilitate type safety and documentation in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals for AWS services, resource states, and pagination names; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any runtime operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is purely static type annotations without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module providing type annotations for AWS resource identifiers and states, using conditional imports for compatibility. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or network interactions. The purpose is solely for type safety, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and documentation confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static utility module for AWS type annotations, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The existing scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
