{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations using Literal for various AWS service literals, used for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Reads module imports (sys and typing/extensions), defines string literal types, assigns them to variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data input, no network or file operations, no execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is solely for type annotations and documentation purposes with no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are present. The code is straightforward and primarily static definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then declares multiple Literal type aliases representing AWS resource identifiers and states. These definitions are used for type hinting and do not execute any runtime logic or include external calls. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious code. The code contains licensing comments and documentation links, suggesting it is a well-structured, purpose-specific module for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS service literals with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and serves as a utility module for type safety. No indicators of malware or security threats are present.",
