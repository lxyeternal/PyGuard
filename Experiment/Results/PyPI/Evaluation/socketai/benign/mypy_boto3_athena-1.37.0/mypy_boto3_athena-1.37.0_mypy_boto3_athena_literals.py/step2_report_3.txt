  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS service identifiers, states, and pagination names.\n- It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- There are no data flows, user inputs, network operations, or external calls.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The code is well-documented, purpose-specific, and appears to be a utility module for type safety.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of code:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type annotations and constants. There are no runtime or dynamic elements that could be malicious.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code does not execute external code, handle untrusted data, or perform any network/file operations.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Security risks:** Given the static nature, no security risks are apparent. The module's purpose is to provide type annotations, not to process data or execute logic.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- No logical flaws are present; the code is simple and serves a well-defined purpose.\n- The conditional import of 'Literal' is standard for compatibility and correctly implemented.\n- The large set of literals aligns with AWS resource identifiers, with no anomalies.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate; no malware is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0. No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or less in all reports. Since the code is purely static, the risk is minimal. The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n\n- All reports correctly assume the code is benign and static.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or exploits are made, which is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n**0** — The code is a static type annotations module with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n**0** — The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n**0** — No security risk, no external data handling, no execution, just static definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe code is a safe, well-structured utility module for type annotations of AWS service literals. There are no signs of supply chain risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|--------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0            | No malicious code, external calls, or suspicious behavior present.          |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            | Code is clear, static, and straightforward.                                  |\n| Security Risk      | 0            | No data processing, external interactions, or secrets involved.            |\n\n**Note:** The reports' confidence levels are high (1), which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe current scoring and analysis are accurate. No changes needed. The code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
