  "review": "Let's evaluate each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS service identifiers, resource states, and pagination names, primarily for type safety in Python projects.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- There are no dynamic operations, external data handling, or execution logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The module includes documentation and licensing comments, indicating a well-structured utility purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as defining type annotations for AWS literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately states that the code is static, safe, and intended for type safety, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Clearly assigns 0, consistent with the static nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the definitions for AWS Athena and other services.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is static, with no dynamic or malicious elements.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Appropriately 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-founded. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the static literal definitions and conditional import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is harmless, static, and designed for type annotations.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0, as expected.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the static nature and the conditional import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly concludes the code is a safe, static definitions module.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines static literals for AWS services.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately describes the code as static, safe, and for type safety.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are correctly set to 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely static type annotations with no external interactions, the risk score should be **0**.\n- **Malware Score:** Confirmed as 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Confirmed as 0; no obfuscation detected.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a straightforward, static set of type annotations for AWS service literals. It contains no dynamic logic, no data handling, no network activity, and no embedded secrets or executable code. The conditional import for compatibility is standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, static definitions)\n- **Security Risk Score:** **0** (no security vulnerabilities or attack vectors)\n\nThis module is a safe, static utility for type safety in Python projects related to AWS SDKs.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign and safe. No changes to scores are necessary.",
