{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for Athena service literals and other AWS service identifiers for type safety in Python code.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'sys' and conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. The module also contains multiple string literals assigned to variables representing AWS constants.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data input, external data handling, or output is present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines constants and type annotations without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of type literals is standard for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. It declares many string literal types for AWS Athena and other AWS services, as well as pagination and region constants. The module serves as a type definitions file for static type checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or covert operations. All elements are straightforward type annotations and string constants. The copyright notice and documentation links are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining type aliases and constants for AWS service identifiers. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard, safe definitions module for type safety.",
