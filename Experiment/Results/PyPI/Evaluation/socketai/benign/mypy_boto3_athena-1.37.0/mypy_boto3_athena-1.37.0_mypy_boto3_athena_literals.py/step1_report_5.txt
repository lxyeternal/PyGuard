{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations for Athena service literals and related AWS resource identifiers for static type checking.",
  "sources": "The code sources include static definitions of string literals assigned to various type aliases, and a conditional import of 'Literal' depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to security issues; the code does not handle input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; this is purely a static type definition module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior are present. The code mainly consists of static literal definitions and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The module imports 'Literal' in a version-aware manner and defines numerous string literal type aliases for AWS Athena and other AWS services. All definitions are static, and there is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. The code appears to serve as type annotations for static analysis and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard static type definitions module for AWS Athena literals and other service names. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It is a straightforward, safe code fragment intended for type safety and documentation.",
