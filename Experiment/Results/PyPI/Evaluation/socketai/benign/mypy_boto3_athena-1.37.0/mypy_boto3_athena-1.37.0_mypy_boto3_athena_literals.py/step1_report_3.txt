{
  "purpose": "Defines type literals for various AWS Athena-related constants and other AWS service names for type annotations in Python code.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module; conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None of the code interacts with untrusted input or data sinks; it solely defines constant literals.",
  "flows": "N/A, as no data flow or processing occurs; only type alias definitions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code consists solely of type alias definitions for literals, no dynamic or runtime code, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for a large set of string literals used in AWS SDK contexts, specifically for Athena service literals and other AWS services. It conditionally imports 'Literal' for compatibility with different Python versions. There are no data processing, external data reading, or execution flows. The code appears to be a static, well-structured module with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not include code execution, network access, or sensitive data handling, reducing the likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard static definitions module for type annotations with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It solely defines string literals for type safety in client code.",
