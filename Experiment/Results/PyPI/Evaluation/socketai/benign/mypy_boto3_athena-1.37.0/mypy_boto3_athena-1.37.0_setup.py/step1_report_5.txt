{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up and installing the mypy-boto3-athena Python package, providing metadata and configuration for package distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; static data including package info, URLs, author details, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to or reads from untrusted sources; no network or system modifications are performed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static data used for setup only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors; all code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static setup configuration for a Python package. It reads a local README file for the long description, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic inputs, network connections, or potentially malicious code segments. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
