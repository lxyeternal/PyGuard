  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script (`setup.py`) for packaging a Python library, with static metadata and no dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; imports from pathlib and setuptools; static parameters in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling or network activity",
  "flows": "Static data from local file to setup() call; no external or untrusted data flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python library. It reads a local README.md file and calls setup() with static, well-known parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, network communications, or obfuscated patterns. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious activities are present, and the code aligns with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
