  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data being executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Read README.md content, then pass static metadata and dependencies to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads the README.md file for long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic evaluations, external data transmissions, or obfuscated segments. All code appears standard and benign, serving solely for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup script for Python package distribution with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
