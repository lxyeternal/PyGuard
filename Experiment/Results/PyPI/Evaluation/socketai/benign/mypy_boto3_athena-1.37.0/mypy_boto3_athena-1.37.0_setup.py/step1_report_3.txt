  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-athena package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, static string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no external data handling or untrusted input sources.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md content into a variable, then passing static parameters to setup(). No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setup() with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no handling of user input or untrusted data. All parameters are hardcoded and standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies without any malicious or suspicious activity.",
