{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-athena package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for long description, imports from pathlib and setuptools, and static strings/metadata within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or executes untrusted data. No network, file, or environment variable sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The script reads a local file for description and uses static metadata for setup configuration; no dynamic data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script, importing necessary modules, reading a Markdown file for description, and calling setup() with fixed metadata. No user input, no external data fetching, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code is typical for Python package distribution and contains no malware indicators or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
