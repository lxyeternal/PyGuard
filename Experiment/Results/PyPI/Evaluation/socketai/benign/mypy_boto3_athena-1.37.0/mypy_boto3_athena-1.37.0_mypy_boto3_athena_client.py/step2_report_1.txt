  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the code as a type annotation and interface for the Athena client, based on import statements, class definitions, and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic, no data processing, no external commands, only type signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is purely declarative, providing static typing and documentation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully benign, standard stub/interface code with high confidence (1), no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on structured API access and type safety.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The presence of generate_presigned_url is noted, which constructs URLs that could be misused if parameters are manipulated, but as this is a type stub, it doesn't perform any URL generation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious behavior; the code is static, purely for type annotations. The mention of URL generation is standard SDK functionality.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard interface, high confidence (1), no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus, emphasizing type safety and API access.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data sinks or external data flows; the code defines method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The import statements are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, purely interface definitions, high confidence (1), no malware.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with focus on type safety and API structure.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods like generate_presigned_url could potentially be misused if parameters are manipulated, but again, as a type stub, it doesn't execute.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, purely structural, high confidence (1), no malware.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, providing type safety and IDE support.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods may involve untrusted input in real execution, but the code here is only type annotations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Completely benign, high confidence (1), no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that this code is a static, type annotation/interface definition with no runtime logic, external data handling, or executable code. **Malware score should be 0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, well-structured, and readable. No obfuscation or hidden code patterns. **Obfuscated score should be 0.0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely declarative with no execution, no secrets, and no dynamic data handling, the risk is minimal. The only potential concern is the presence of generate_presigned_url, which could be misused if the code were part of a runtime environment, but as a static stub, this is not an issue. **Risk score should be 0.0**.\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThis code is a standard, well-structured type stub/interface for the AWS Athena boto3 client. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The purpose is to facilitate static analysis, IDE features, and type safety, with no runtime execution.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
