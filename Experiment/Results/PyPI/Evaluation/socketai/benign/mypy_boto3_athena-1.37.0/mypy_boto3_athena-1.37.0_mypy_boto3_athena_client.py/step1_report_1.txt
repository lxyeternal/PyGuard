  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definition for the Athena client in boto3-stubs, providing static typing and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and property definitions that declare data types and external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data, execute external commands, or perform network operations; the code is purely interface/typing definitions.",
  "flows": "The code defines method signatures and type annotations, with no runtime logic or data flow implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. It strictly defines type annotations for boto3 Athena client.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured type annotation and interface class for boto3 Athena client, including method signatures, property types, and overloads for paginators. It imports necessary types and defines exception types. No data processing, external command execution, or malicious logic is present. The class is a static interface with no runtime execution or data handling beyond type declarations.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a purely declarative, type annotation file for the Athena boto3 client, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard stub interface used for static analysis and type checking.",
