  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 Athena client, facilitating static analysis, IDE features, and type safety.",
  "sources": "Method signatures accepting parameters, import statements, class definitions, and property declarations.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data sinks; method signatures define API interactions but do not execute logic.",
  "flows": "Parameter inputs flow into API calls; however, as this is a static stub, no actual data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive static type stub for the Athena client, including method signatures, properties, and documentation links. It contains no executable logic, no dynamic code, and no external command execution. The presence of methods like generate_presigned_url is standard SDK functionality and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is well-structured, readable, and serves solely for static type checking and IDE support. No anomalies or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured static interface for the AWS Athena boto3 client. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The purpose is to facilitate static analysis, IDE features, and type safety. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is effectively 0.",
