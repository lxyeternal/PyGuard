  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS Athena service, providing type safety and IDE support for Athena API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, third-party dependencies, and local type definitions; class and method definitions reading method parameters and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate pre-signed URLs, perform resource modifications, and execute queries or control sessions, potentially handling untrusted data or inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to various client methods (e.g., query execution, resource creation/deletion) with no evidence of data passing to external or malicious endpoints within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. The code appears to be a structured interface with comprehensive documentation. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class and method definitions, and extensive documentation links. It defines a client class for AWS Athena with methods corresponding to AWS API operations, using modern Python typing and overloads for paginators. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The purpose is to facilitate type-safe API calls. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or secret keys are present. The code is well-structured, and all components are consistent with a SDK interface design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a type-annotated SDK interface for AWS Athena, designed for static analysis, IDE support, and type safety. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured client interface with no embedded malware.",
