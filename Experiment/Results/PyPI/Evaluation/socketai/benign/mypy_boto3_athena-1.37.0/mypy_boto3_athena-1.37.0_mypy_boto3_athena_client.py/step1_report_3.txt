  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the Athena service in boto3, enabling type-safe API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class definitions and method signatures that define API behavior and data flow.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that perform API calls, generate URLs, and manage resources; no direct data sinks or external data exfiltration points detected.",
  "flows": "Method signatures specify input parameters (sources) that lead to API calls or URL generations (sinks). No dynamic code execution or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code strictly defines type annotations and client interfaces. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured type annotation and interface definition for the Athena client in boto3. It uses Python typing features and overloads to define method signatures for API calls. No runtime code, data processing, or external communications are implemented here. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The import statements are standard and do not perform any malicious actions. The code’s purpose appears solely to provide type hints and documentation for safer coding practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign interface definition for AWS Athena client with no malicious intent. It is designed for type safety and documentation purposes only.",
