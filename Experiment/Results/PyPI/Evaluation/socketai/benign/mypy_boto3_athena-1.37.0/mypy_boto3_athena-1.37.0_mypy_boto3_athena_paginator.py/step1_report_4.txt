  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for Athena service client, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration (e.g., sys.version_info), imports from boto3, botocore, and local type definition modules. No untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, files, or network. The paginate methods return iterators over responses but do not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The code defines classes that extend base paginator classes and their paginate methods, which accept keyword arguments based on provided type definitions. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be standard type-safe wrapper classes for boto3 paginators.",
  "analysis": "The script defines type-safe paginator classes for the Athena client, with careful conditional typing based on Python version. The classes extend boto3 paginator classes and specify type annotations for input and output data. There are no dynamic code execution, network activities, or data processing that could be malicious. All code appears to be boilerplate for type annotations and class inheritance, with documentation links and standard structure. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation and class extension module for boto3 Athena paginators, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a type-safe interface wrapper, with no dangerous behaviors identified.",
