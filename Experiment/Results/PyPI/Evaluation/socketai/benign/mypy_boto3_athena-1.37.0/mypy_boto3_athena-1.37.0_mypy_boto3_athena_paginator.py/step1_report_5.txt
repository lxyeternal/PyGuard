{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginator classes for Athena client in boto3, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs. No external user input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted. No network or system modification code present.",
  "flows": "The code establishes class hierarchies and method signatures for paginators, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is well-structured, standard for type annotations, and contains no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with appropriate type annotations, leveraging Python typing features. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, and uses type ignore comments for compatibility. The classes extend from base Paginator classes and override 'paginate' methods with correct type signatures. No data input handling, network operations, or system modifications are present. The code's purpose is solely to provide type-safe interfaces for boto3 Athena paginators. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type annotation module for boto3 Athena paginators. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, only static type definitions to improve code correctness and developer experience.",
