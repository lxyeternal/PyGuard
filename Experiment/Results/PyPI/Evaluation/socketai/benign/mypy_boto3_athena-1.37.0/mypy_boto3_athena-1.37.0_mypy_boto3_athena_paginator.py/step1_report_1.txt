  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the Athena service client in boto3, providing type hints and structure for pagination methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.paginate, type definitions from .type_defs, sys.version_info for version-specific imports.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods, which accept **kwargs for pagination parameters and return PageIterator objects.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data can flow from the **kwargs in paginate methods into paginator execution, potentially affecting data handling but not execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code consists solely of class definitions, type annotations, and imports. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines typed paginator classes for the boto3 Athena client, including detailed type annotations for inputs and outputs. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, standard Python typing patterns, and docstrings linking to documentation. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The structure is consistent with standard boto3-stubs generated code, aimed at providing type hints for IDEs and static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type annotation module for boto3 Athena paginators. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It serves purely for type hinting and code completion support.",
