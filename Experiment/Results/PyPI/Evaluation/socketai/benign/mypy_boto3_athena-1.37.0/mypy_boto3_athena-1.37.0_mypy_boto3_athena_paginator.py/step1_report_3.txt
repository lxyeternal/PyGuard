{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3 Athena service client, facilitating paginated API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class methods accessing paginator parameters via **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows involving untrusted input directly leading to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "paginate() methods receive untrusted **kwargs, passed to the parent Paginator.paginate, which could be sources if user-controlled, but no evident data leakage or malicious actions are performed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of type: ignore for override annotations; standard paginator pattern; no obfuscation or unusual language features. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes inheriting from a generic Paginator base, with type annotations for input and output types. The paginate methods accept dynamic parameters via **kwargs, unpacked with Unpack[TypeDef], and return PageIterator of specific output types. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code relies on standard AWS SDK patterns and only enhances type safety and documentation. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic is present. Use of type: ignore suggests compatibility adjustments but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a type-safe wrapper around AWS Athena paginator interfaces with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It strictly adheres to standard design patterns for AWS SDK stub generation and usage, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected.",
