      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate environment management utility with advanced features. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. However, its unsafe manipulation of frame locals poses a moderate security risk, especially if external sources or untrusted code influence its behavior. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.5, reflecting the potential for misuse due to unsafe practices, but no active malicious activity is evident."
