{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python package setup script that defines package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call, including package name, version, description, author info, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process or transfer data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils.core.setup and calls it with fixed metadata. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network operations, or obfuscated patterns. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard setup script. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of deprecated distutils is noted but does not impact security. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package setup script with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
