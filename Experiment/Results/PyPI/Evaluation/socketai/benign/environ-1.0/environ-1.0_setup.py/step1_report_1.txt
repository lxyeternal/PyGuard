{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python module named 'environ', providing metadata about the package for distribution.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or outputs that could leak untrusted data; it solely sets package info.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of 'distutils' is standard for setup scripts, although it's deprecated in favor of 'setuptools'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core' and calls 'setup()' with static package metadata such as name, version, author, and classifiers. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no code execution, and no suspicious logic. The script functions as a typical Python package setup configuration. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform any dangerous operations.",
