  "sources": "No external input sources; static code with no data reading mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, hidden code, or obfuscated segments. The code appears straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script utilizing distutils to define package metadata. It does not include any data input, external network communication, or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, no code injection, and no malicious logic. The script solely specifies package details such as name, version, author, and classifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical and benign setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard packaging code with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
