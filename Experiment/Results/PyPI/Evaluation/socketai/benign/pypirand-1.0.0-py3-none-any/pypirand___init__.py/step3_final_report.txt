  "purpose": "Generate a random password of specified length using ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation.",
  "sources": "Characters from string.ascii_letters, string.digits, string.punctuation; random.choice for character selection.",
  "sinks": "Generated password string returned by the function.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'length' determines number of characters; each character is selected via random.choice from all_chars; concatenated into password.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward implementation. Use of 'random.choice' instead of 'secrets.choice' for cryptographic security is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple password generator that combines character sets and randomly selects characters to form a password. It uses standard libraries and has no external data inputs or outputs. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The main concern is the use of 'random.choice', which is not cryptographically secure; 'secrets.choice' would be preferable for security-sensitive applications. The malware score is correctly 0, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The security risk score is low (~0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the non-cryptographic randomness, which is acceptable for non-critical uses but should be higher if cryptographic security is required.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward password generator with no malicious behavior. The only notable issue is the security risk associated with the randomness method, which is acknowledged but not flagged as malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
