  "purpose": "Generate a random password of specified length for security or authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; uses internal constants (ASCII letters, digits, symbols).",
  "sinks": "Returns a generated password string; no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'length' influences password length; internal character selection is random but not influenced by external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard library functions without obfuscation or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets or anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to generate a random password by selecting characters from a comprehensive set of ASCII letters, digits, and symbols. It utilizes Python's 'random.choice' to pick characters, which is suitable for basic password generation but not cryptographically secure. There are no external data sources, no sinks that leak data, and no suspicious or malicious behavior present. The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and free of anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign password generator that uses non-cryptographically secure randomness. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is suitable for non-critical password generation but should be replaced with a cryptographically secure method for sensitive applications.",
