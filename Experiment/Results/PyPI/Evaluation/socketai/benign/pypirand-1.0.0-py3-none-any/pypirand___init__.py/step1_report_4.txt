  "purpose": "Generate a random password of specified length",
  "sources": "random.choice() function used to select characters from combined character set",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not output or transmit data externally",
  "flows": "Character selection from combined character set to password string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward password generation logic; no hardcoded secrets beyond character sets",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to generate a password by randomly selecting characters from a set of ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation. It uses Python's standard random.choice() method without external inputs or outputs. No external data sources or sinks are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected; it appears to be a typical password generator. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple password generator that does not contain malicious behavior. It employs standard library functions for randomness and character handling without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
