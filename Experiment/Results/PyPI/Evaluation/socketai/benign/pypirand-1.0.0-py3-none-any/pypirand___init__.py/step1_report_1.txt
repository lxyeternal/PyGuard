  "purpose": "Generate a random password of specified length for security purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads from string constants (ascii_letters, digits, punctuation) for character selection.",
  "sinks": "Uses random.choice to select characters, combines into a password string.",
  "flows": "From source constants to random.choice to password assembly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Uses standard library functions for password generation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the 'random' module to generate a password composed of letters, digits, and symbols. It combines character sets into one string and selects randomly from this combined set for each character in the password. The approach is typical for password generation. No input or untrusted data is processed, and there are no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward password generator with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a basic password generator using standard Python libraries, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
