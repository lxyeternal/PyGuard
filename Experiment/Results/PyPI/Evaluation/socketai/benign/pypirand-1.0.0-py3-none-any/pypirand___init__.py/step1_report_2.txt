  "purpose": "Generate a random password of specified length for security purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from string constants (ascii_letters, digits, punctuation) and the 'length' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Generates a password string by selecting random characters; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs (character sets and length) are combined and used to produce a password string via random.choice within a generator expression.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Uses standard Python libraries without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'random' and 'string' modules. It defines a function 'generate_password' that creates a password by randomly selecting characters from combined character sets. The process is straightforward and typical for password generation. No data leakage, malicious data handling, or external communication observed. The use of 'random.choice' for password generation is standard, although for cryptographic security, 'secrets' module is preferable, but its absence here does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a simple password generator using standard Python libraries without any suspicious or malicious behaviors. It appears to be a benign utility function intended for generating secure passwords, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
