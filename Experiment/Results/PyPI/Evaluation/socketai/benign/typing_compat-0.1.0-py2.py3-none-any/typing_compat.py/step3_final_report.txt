  "purpose": "Compatibility functions for get_args and get_origin across Python versions, providing fallback implementations for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Internal typing attributes such as _GenericAlias, _Literal, _ClassVar, __mro__, __origin__, and other internal type structures.",
  "sinks": "No external input, data flow, or untrusted data sources; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Internal attribute checks and function definitions without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal, non-public typing attributes which may be unstable across Python versions but are standard for compatibility layers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility layer for Python's typing module, handling different Python versions to provide get_args and get_origin functions. It relies on internal attributes like _GenericAlias, _Literal, and _ClassVar, which are internal APIs. There are no external inputs, network calls, or data leaks. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The internal attribute usage is typical for such compatibility code but could pose minor stability risks if internal structures change. Overall, the code is benign, intended solely for internal type introspection support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility for Python's typing module, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight security risk score reflects reliance on internal attributes, which is typical for compatibility layers but does not constitute a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.05).",
