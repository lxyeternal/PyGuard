{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility functions for Python's typing module, enabling support for get_args and get_origin across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for collections and typing; function definitions and attribute checks; conditional imports and fallback implementations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution effects; no network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, defining functions, and conditionally handling different Python versions to emulate typing features. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains complex version-dependent implementations for compatibility but no suspicious or unusual behavior such as obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to provide backwards compatibility for get_args and get_origin functions of the typing module, handling multiple Python versions, including Python 3.7 and earlier. It uses attribute checks, type introspection, and fallback functions. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious logic. There are no external network calls, file modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The complexity stems from version compatibility logic rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility library for typing functions, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is well-structured and intended to ensure compatibility across Python versions without harmful effects.",
