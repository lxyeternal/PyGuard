  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility for Python's typing module, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight security risk score reflects reliance on internal attributes, which is typical for compatibility layers but does not constitute a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.05)."
