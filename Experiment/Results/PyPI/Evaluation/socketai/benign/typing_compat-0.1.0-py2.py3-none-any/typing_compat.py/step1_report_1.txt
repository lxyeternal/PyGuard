{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility functions for Python's typing module across different Python versions, enabling consistent retrieval of type information like get_args and get_origin.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; internal definitions and imports from typing and collections modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential points where untrusted data flows into security-sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code mainly defines utility functions and compatibility layers without data flow between external inputs and sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be standard compatibility code. It contains no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. It replicates functionality present in the standard typing module for older Python versions.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with importing standard modules and defining metadata. It attempts to import get_args and get_origin from typing, providing fallback implementations for older Python versions. The fallback functions emulate Python 3.8+ typing functions, handling various cases and edge conditions to ensure compatibility. No external input handling, network access, or file operations are present. The code's purpose is solely to provide consistent type inspection functions across different environments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. The structure is straightforward, and the logic is standard for such compatibility modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign compatibility layer for the typing module, designed to work across multiple Python versions. There is no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. Overall, it appears safe and typical for a library meant to provide compatibility support.",
