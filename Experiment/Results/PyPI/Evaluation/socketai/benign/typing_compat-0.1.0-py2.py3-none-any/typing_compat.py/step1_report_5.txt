{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility functions for Python's typing module across different Python versions, enabling consistent retrieval of type arguments and origins.",
  "sources": "The code reads static attributes, class properties, and module functions related to type information. No user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or inputs; it primarily deals with internal type information and function definitions. No data is sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "Since the code does not handle untrusted input, there are no source-to-sink data flows. It defines functions and conditions for type handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and focused on compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports or defines functions to provide compatibility for Python's typing module across different versions. It carefully checks Python version features and defines fallback implementations for older versions. The functions _get_origin and _get_args emulate behavior from newer typing modules, with internal handling for specific types and edge cases. There are no obfuscated code patterns, malicious constructs, or suspicious logic. The overall structure is consistent with a library intended to support type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility utility for Python's typing module, with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a well-structured, non-malicious library component intended to ensure compatibility across Python versions.",
