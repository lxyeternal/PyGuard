{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility functions for Python's typing module across different Python versions, enabling the retrieval of type arguments and origins for generic types.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'typing' module, checks for available functions or attributes, and imports or defines compatibility functions based on Python version. It does not read external inputs or user data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in this code. It purely defines functions for internal use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code consists of standard compatibility layer functions with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script starts with importing standard modules and defining metadata. It attempts to import Python 3.8's get_args and get_origin; if unavailable, it defines fallback functions compatible with earlier Python versions, including Python 3.7 and below. These functions emulate the behavior of the standard typing module. The code avoids executing untrusted inputs, contains no network or system modification commands, and has no obfuscated code. It solely provides utility functions for type introspection across different Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility library for the Python typing module. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and does not pose any security risk. It is safe to use in Python projects requiring type introspection across multiple versions.",
