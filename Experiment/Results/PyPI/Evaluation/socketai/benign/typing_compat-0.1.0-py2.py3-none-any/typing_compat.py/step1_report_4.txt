{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility functions for Python typing modules across different Python versions, allowing consistent access to type argument and origin information.",
  "sources": "It reads from the typing module, collections.abc, and attributes of user-defined types or objects related to type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used to cause data leaks or system effects; the code primarily defines functions for type inspection.",
  "flows": "The functions _get_origin and _get_args flow from input types (type objects) to their origin and arguments, respectively, with no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains conditional logic to handle various Python versions, and uses internal typing module attributes like _GenericAlias, _Literal, _ClassVar, etc. These are internal and potentially unstable, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a compatibility layer for the typing module, handling different Python versions and internal structures. It uses internal attributes such as _GenericAlias, _Literal, _ClassVar, and _Union, which are known internal markers in the typing module. There are no network operations, system calls, or data manipulations that could indicate malicious behavior. The code strictly provides functions for introspection of type annotations, with fallback implementations for older Python versions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility library for Python typing and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It operates solely on type inspection functions, with careful handling of internal typing structures across Python versions. No malware or malicious intent is evident.",
