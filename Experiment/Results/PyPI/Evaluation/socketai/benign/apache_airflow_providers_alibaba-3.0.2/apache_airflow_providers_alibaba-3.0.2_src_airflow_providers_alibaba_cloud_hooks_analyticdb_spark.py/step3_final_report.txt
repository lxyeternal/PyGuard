  "purpose": "API wrapper for Alibaba Cloud AnalyticDB Spark service within Airflow, managing Spark applications and credentials securely via connection extras.",
  "sources": "Connection extras for credentials; input parameters for API requests",
  "sinks": "API request objects, logs, application state responses",
  "flows": "Credentials from connection extras flow into API client creation; data flows into API requests and responses",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard validation and error handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API client for Alibaba Cloud's AnalyticDB Spark service, securely handling credentials, validating inputs, and performing API interactions without any signs of malicious activity. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is present. The assigned scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are justified. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) aligns with the code's purpose and security practices. The high confidence scores reflect the thorough analysis and standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, secure, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk and malware scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
