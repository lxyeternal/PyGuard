  "purpose": "The provided code is a licensing comment header from an open-source project, specifically related to licensing and attribution details.",
  "sources": "The code sources are the comment lines at the beginning of a Python file, containing licensing information.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flow points; this is purely a comment block with no executable code or data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code contains only comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors; the code is standard licensing documentation. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license header used in open-source projects to specify licensing terms. It contains no executable instructions, data processing, or potentially malicious constructs. There are no source or sink points, and the comments do not perform any actions or data flows. The content is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a benign licensing header with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior. It is a standard practice in open-source projects.",
