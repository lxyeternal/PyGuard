  "purpose": "This code is a standard licensing comment header with no executable code or data flows.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input or data reading occurs in comments)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data processing or output)",
  "flows": "N/A (no data or control flow, as it is only comments)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a licensing comment block with no suspicious or unusual features",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments with no executable statements, data processing, or data flows. All reports correctly identify it as benign boilerplate. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence is high (1) due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign licensing comment header with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are justified and accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
