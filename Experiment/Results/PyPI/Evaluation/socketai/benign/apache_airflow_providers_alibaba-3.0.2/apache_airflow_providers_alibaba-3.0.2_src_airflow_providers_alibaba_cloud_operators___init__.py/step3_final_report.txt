  "purpose": "This code contains only license header comments from the Apache Software Foundation, serving as licensing information for the file.",
  "sources": "The comments themselves serve as the source; no external data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects, as the code is purely comments.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code does not process or transmit any data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious code are present; the code is standard license boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments with no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign boilerplate. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1—are appropriate and consistent with the content. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are detected or implied. The code poses no security threat and requires no further action.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless license header comments with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
