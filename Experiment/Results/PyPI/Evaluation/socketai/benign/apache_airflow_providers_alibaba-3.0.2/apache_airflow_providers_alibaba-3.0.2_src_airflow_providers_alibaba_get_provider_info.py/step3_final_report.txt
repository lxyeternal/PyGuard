  "purpose": "Static function returning package metadata for the 'apache-airflow-providers-alibaba' package, including versions, integrations, operators, sensors, hooks, dependencies, and documentation URLs.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data within the function; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to a dictionary and returned; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is auto-generated, static, and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function that returns a predefined dictionary containing package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, no external input handling, no network activity, and no sensitive data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The code's purpose is purely informational, serving as a static configuration or documentation resource. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's static and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration function with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
