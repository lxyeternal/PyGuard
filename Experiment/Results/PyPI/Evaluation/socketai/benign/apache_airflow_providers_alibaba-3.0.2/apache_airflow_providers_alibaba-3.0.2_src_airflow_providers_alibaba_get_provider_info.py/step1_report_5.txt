  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration details about the Apache Airflow Alibaba provider package, including version info, integrations, operators, sensors, hooks, connection types, dependencies, and logging configurations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings and data structures within the get_provider_info() function, including package info, version lists, integration details, operator/sensor/hook/module references, dependency specifications.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted input or write data to external locations.",
  "flows": "Data is statically returned from the function; no runtime input flow or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, contains only static data structures, with no execution of dynamic code, external inputs, or side effects. No suspicious or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script consists solely of a function returning a structured dictionary with package metadata, version lists, and module references. It contains no code execution, input processing, or network activity. All strings are static, and the data appears to serve documentation or configuration purposes. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, static metadata definition for an Apache Airflow provider package. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
