  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports identify the code as a license header comment, which is purely informational and contains no executable code, data processing, or input/output operations. Therefore, there are no issues related to malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities in the actual code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly recognize that the code is a standard license header with no malicious or suspicious content. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the nature of the code. The `confidence` score is 1.0, which is reasonable since the assessment is straightforward.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely a license comment with no executable content, there's no justification for any risk score above 0.0. The assessments are consistent and reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious activity or code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as non-executable and safe.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores align with the content and the assessments provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0  \n\n**Overall Justification**:  \nThe code is a standard license header comment with no executable code, data flow, or suspicious patterns. The assessments are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**The code is safe, non-malicious, and contains no obfuscation or security risks.**  \n**Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.**",
