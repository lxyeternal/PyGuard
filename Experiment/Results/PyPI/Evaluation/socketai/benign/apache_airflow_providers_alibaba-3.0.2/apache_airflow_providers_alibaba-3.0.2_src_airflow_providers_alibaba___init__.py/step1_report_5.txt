{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a generated initialization file for a Python package, primarily setting version information and performing a runtime check on the Airflow version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via an import statement: 'from airflow import __version__ as airflow_version'. It also accesses the package version string assigned to '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a control flow based on input data. No data is being written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Source: airflow.__version__ -> Conditional check -> Sink: RuntimeError raised if version is too low.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and typical for version checking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info from airflow, parses it with packaging.version, and compares it to a minimum required version. It raises an exception if the condition is not met. No external data inputs besides the airflow version are used. The code is standard for dependency version validation. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, auto-generated version check script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard validation to ensure compatibility and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
