{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be a version check for a Python package related to Apache Airflow, enforcing minimum version requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current Airflow version from the imported `airflow.__version__` and the version string '3.0.2' assigned to `__version__`.",
  "sinks": "The version comparison logic may lead to a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0; this is a control flow decision, not a data leak or security concern.",
  "flows": "The source `airflow.__version__` flows into the version comparison condition, which may trigger an exception (sink) if the condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or obfuscated code are present. The code uses straightforward version parsing and comparison. The comment indicates that this file is auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version handling utilities and the current airflow version, then compares it to a threshold. If the current version is below 2.9.0, it raises an exception. This is a simple version check with no external inputs or outputs involved, and no suspicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage is detected. The use of version parsing libraries is standard and secure. The code is minimal, clear, and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard version check to enforce compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a straightforward, safe version validation script.",
