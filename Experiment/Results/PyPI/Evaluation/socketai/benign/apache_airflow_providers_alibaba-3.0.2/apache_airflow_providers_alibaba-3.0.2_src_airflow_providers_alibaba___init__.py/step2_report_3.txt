  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the provided scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward auto-generated script for an Apache Airflow provider package.\n- It imports version info (`__version__` from airflow and a hardcoded `__version__`).\n- It performs a version check: if the current airflow version is less than 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- The purpose is compatibility validation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Validates package version and runtime Airflow version.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code; straightforward version check.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar version validation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; standard version check.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Enforces minimum version requirement.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity; simple comparison.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Initialization with version validation.\n- **Findings:** Standard version check, no obfuscation or malware.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Version validation for compatibility.\n- **Findings:** Straightforward, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which is accurate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the code performs a benign version check without any security implications.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, auto-generated, and performs standard version validation.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No further changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe version validation script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are needed.",
