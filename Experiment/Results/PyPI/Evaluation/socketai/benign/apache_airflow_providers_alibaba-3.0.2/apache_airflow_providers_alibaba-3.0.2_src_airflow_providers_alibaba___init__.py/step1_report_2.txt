{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated module for an Apache Airflow provider, primarily for version validation and version-related metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the Airflow version via import (__version__ and airflow_version). No external data inputs or user inputs are processed.",
  "targets": "Uses the parsed airflow_version for comparison; raises a RuntimeError if the version is below 2.9.0.",
  "flows": "The code compares airflow version (source) with a fixed version string ('2.9.0') and raises an exception if the condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The only notable behavior is version validation, which is standard. The comment indicates the file is auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version handling libraries, retrieves the current airflow version, and checks if it meets a minimum version requirement. If not, it raises an exception with a specific message. No user input handling, network activity, or obfuscated code present. The purpose is straightforward version validation, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version check script for a Python package. It performs version validation without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
