  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the code's security implications, consistency of scores, and any potential issues.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: a version validation script for an Apache Airflow provider package.\n- The code imports version info, compares it to a fixed minimum version ('2.9.0'), and raises a RuntimeError if the current version is too low.\n- No external inputs, network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated, straightforward, and standard for dependency version validation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code's logic is simple: version parsing and comparison.\n- The version check is standard practice; no vulnerabilities or malicious code are evident.\n- The code does not perform any data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and auto-generated.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely a version check with no malicious activity, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The current score of 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is harmless, standard, and auto-generated.\n- No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The version check is a common, safe pattern.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that version validation code is kept up-to-date and that no external inputs are introduced that could compromise its integrity. In this case, the code is safe and standard.",
