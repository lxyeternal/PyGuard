  "purpose": "The code defines metadata and version checks for an Apache Airflow provider package, including a runtime version validation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (airflow version), package version strings, and imports modules for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "Potential runtime error if version check fails, raising a RuntimeError.",
  "flows": "Reads airflow version from imported module -> parses version -> compares with fixed string -> raises error if condition met.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code's behavior is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles version validation for compatibility, using standard imports and comparison logic. No external input is directly used in a malicious manner. The version check ensures compatibility and raises an error if conditions are not met. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic version validation check with standard imports and error handling. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. It appears to be an auto-generated, harmless configuration validation script.",
