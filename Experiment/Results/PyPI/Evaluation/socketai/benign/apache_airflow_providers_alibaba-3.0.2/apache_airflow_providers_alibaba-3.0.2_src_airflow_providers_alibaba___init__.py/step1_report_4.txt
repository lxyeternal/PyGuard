{
  "purpose": "This code initializes version checks and imports for a Python package related to Apache Airflow providers, with an emphasis on compatibility validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via import (__version__ from airflow) and the package version string (__version__ = '3.0.2').",
  "sinks": "The only significant sink is the RuntimeError raised if the Airflow version is less than 2.9.0, which outputs an error message.",
  "flows": "The code reads the airflow version, compares it to a specified minimum version, and may raise an error if the condition is not met.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code performs standard version checking and imports. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical package initialization file with version validation logic. It imports necessary modules, checks the installed airflow version, and raises an error if the version requirement is not met. The logic and flow are straightforward and adhere to normal Python practices. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The only notable activity is version validation, which is standard for compatibility enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard version validation and import operations for a Python package. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. No suspicious behavior is present.",
