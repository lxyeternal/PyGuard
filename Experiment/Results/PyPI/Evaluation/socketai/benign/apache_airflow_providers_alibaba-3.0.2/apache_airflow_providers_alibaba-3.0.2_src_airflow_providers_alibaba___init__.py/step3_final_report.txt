{
  "purpose": "This code performs a version check for the apache-airflow-providers-alibaba package, ensuring the installed Airflow version meets the minimum requirement of 2.9.0.",
  "sources": "Imports the current Airflow version from the airflow module.",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which halts execution.",
  "flows": "The code parses the airflow version, compares it to the minimum required version, and triggers an exception if the check fails.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward version comparison with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the current Airflow version and a package version string, then compares the parsed version against a hardcoded minimum ('2.9.0'). If the current version is less, it raises a RuntimeError to prevent incompatible usage. The code is auto-generated, uses standard libraries, and performs a simple, benign validation. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The logic is correct and typical for dependency validation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version check script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It ensures compatibility by enforcing a minimum Airflow version. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, and the code poses no security threat.",
