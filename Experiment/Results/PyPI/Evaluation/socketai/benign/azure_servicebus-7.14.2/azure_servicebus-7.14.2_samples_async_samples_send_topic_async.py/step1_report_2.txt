  "purpose": "Send messages asynchronously to an Azure Service Bus Topic for messaging or notification purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE and SERVICEBUS_TOPIC_NAME; DefaultAzureCredential() for authentication; input data from hardcoded message strings.",
  "sinks": "Sending messages to Azure Service Bus, which is a legitimate use case; no untrusted data processing or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> DefaultAzureCredential -> ServiceBusClient -> send messages -> print confirmation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of standard Azure SDK libraries; no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data; proper async usage.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes Azure SDKs to send messages asynchronously to an Azure Service Bus topic, with environment variables for configuration and standard credential management. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system actions is present. The code appears to be a straightforward example or utility for message sending. It does not contain obfuscated code, malicious API calls, or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example for sending messages to Azure Service Bus, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is well-structured and uses recommended SDK practices. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
