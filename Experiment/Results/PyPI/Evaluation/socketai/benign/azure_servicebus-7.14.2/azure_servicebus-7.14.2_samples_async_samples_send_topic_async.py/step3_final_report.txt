{
  "purpose": "Example demonstrating sending messages asynchronously to an Azure Service Bus Topic.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for namespace and topic name; static message contents within the code.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK's send_messages method; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Static messages created in functions, passed directly to sender.send_messages() without external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses environment variables securely, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured example of asynchronous message sending using Azure SDK. It employs environment variables for configuration, uses proper async context managers, and sends static messages with no user input or untrusted data. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The message contents are static, and the SDK calls are legitimate. No network activity outside Azure SDK calls, and no data exfiltration or backdoors are evident. The code aligns with best practices and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, correctly implemented, and poses no security threat. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
