  "conclusion": "The code is benign and demonstrates standard Azure SDK usage with insecure proxy credentials. It does not contain malware or obfuscation but has a security flaw in credential handling. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the primary concern is insecure credential management, which should be addressed but does not indicate malicious activity."
