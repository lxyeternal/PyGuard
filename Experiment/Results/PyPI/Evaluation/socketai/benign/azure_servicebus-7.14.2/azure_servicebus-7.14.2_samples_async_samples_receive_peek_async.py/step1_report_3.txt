{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates browsing messages in an Azure Service Bus queue asynchronously for monitoring or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE' and 'SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_NAME' are read for configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used to initialize the ServiceBusClient and QueueReceiver, which then asynchronously peek at messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious code observed. No obfuscated or unusual language features. Proper use of SDKs and environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The script securely reads configuration from environment variables, uses Azure SDKs to connect to a Service Bus, and asynchronously peeks messages without altering or deleting them. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The code performs a benign operation of browsing messages for monitoring purposes. It properly manages resources with async context managers, following best practices. There are no signs of backdoors, data theft, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign example for browsing messages in an Azure Service Bus queue. It uses environment variables for configuration, interacts with Azure SDKs properly, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
