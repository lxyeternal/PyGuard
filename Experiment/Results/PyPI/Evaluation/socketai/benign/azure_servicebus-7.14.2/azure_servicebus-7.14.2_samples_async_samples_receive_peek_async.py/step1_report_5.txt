  "purpose": "The script demonstrates browsing pending messages in an Azure Service Bus queue asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE' and 'SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_NAME' used to obtain configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Printing messages to stdout, which could expose message contents if run in an insecure environment.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> credential and namespace setup -> Azure SDK to connect and peek messages -> output messages to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No unusual code structures or obfuscation. Use of environment variables is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves connection parameters from environment variables and uses Azure SDKs with proper context managers. It performs message peeking without altering the queue or sending data externally. No suspicious or malicious actions are detected, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors. The only potential concern is printing message content, which is standard for debugging or display but may leak sensitive data if environment is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of browsing Azure Service Bus messages with no malicious intent. It properly manages credentials and resources without suspicious behavior.",
