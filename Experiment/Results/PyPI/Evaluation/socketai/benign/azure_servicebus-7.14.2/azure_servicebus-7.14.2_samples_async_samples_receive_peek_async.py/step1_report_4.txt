{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates browsing messages in an Azure Service Bus queue asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Environment variables SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE and SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_NAME are read as inputs for ServiceBusClient initialization and queue access.",
  "sinks": "The retrieved messages are printed to stdout, which is a benign operation; no external data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to configure the ServiceBusClient; messages are peeked and printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variables are used securely. No suspicious code or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely obtains connection parameters via environment variables, initializes the Azure Service Bus client with default Azure credentials, and asynchronously peeks at messages in the queue. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious activities are present. The code follows standard Azure SDK usage patterns and does not perform any unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard example of reading and browsing messages from an Azure Service Bus queue. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The code appears safe and aligned with typical usage.",
