{
  "purpose": "Example script to browse pending messages in an Azure Service Bus queue asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Environment variables SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE and SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_NAME for configuration; SDK functions for message retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Printing message contents to stdout, which could expose sensitive data if environment is insecure.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> SDK client creation -> peek_messages() -> print(str(msg))",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard SDK practices.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads configuration from environment variables, employs Azure SDKs correctly for asynchronous message browsing, and prints message contents. No malicious code, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation is present. The only operational concern is potential data leakage through message printing, but this is typical for debugging and not a security flaw. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of Azure Service Bus message browsing with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security risk associated with printing message contents is operational rather than security-related. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
