{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates how to asynchronously browse messages in an Azure Service Bus queue using Azure SDKs and environment variables for configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE and SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_NAME provide the namespace and queue name. os.environ accesses these variables.",
  "sinks": "The code prints messages retrieved from the queue to standard output.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources; messages are received from the queue; the messages are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed. Usage of standard SDK functions and environment variables is typical.",
  "analysis": "The script securely uses environment variables for configuration. It employs Azure SDKs with proper asynchronous handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The only data flow is reading environment variables and queue messages, with messages being printed out, which is standard. No code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected. The code is straightforward and uses SDKs as intended.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example of browsing messages in an Azure Service Bus queue. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. It uses environment variables securely and outputs message contents to stdout, which is typical for debugging or message inspection purposes.",
