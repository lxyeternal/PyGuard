It does not contain malware or obfuscation but has a security flaw in credential handling. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the primary concern is insecure credential management, which should be addressed but does not indicate malicious activity."

The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified given its testing nature. The use of internal attributes should be documented as a testing approach but does not pose a security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or security risks. All previous reports correctly identified its safe nature. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report could be slightly adjusted to 0, but it remains acceptable given the standard use of environment variables and network communication. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
