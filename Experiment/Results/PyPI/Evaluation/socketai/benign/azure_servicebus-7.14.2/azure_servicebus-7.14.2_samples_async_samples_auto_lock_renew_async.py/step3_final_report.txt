{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of Azure Service Bus SDK for auto lock renewal on messages and sessions, including failure handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for configuration, SDK methods for sending, receiving, and renewing locks.",
  "sinks": "No malicious data flows or exfiltration points; standard message processing and lock management.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables -> SDK calls for message/session handling -> lock renewal and completion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal attribute '_sleep_time' in AutoLockRenewer, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK usage example for lock renewal, including failure simulation. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The internal attribute '_sleep_time' is used to simulate renewal failure, which is acceptable for testing purposes. The environment variables are used appropriately for configuration. The code does not perform any network activity beyond SDK operations, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of Azure Service Bus lock renewal features with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified given its testing nature. The use of internal attributes should be documented as a testing approach but does not pose a security threat.",
