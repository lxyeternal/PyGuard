{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate usage of Azure Service Bus AutoLockRenewer asynchronously for non-sessionful and sessionful queues, including handling lock renewal failures.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_NAME, SERVICEBUS_SESSION_QUEUE_NAME); user-supplied message content.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no code that writes untrusted data to external systems or performs unsafe actions.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables is used to configure ServiceBusClient; messages are sent and received; lock renewal registration occurs; no external untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed. The code uses standard Azure SDK patterns, proper async context managers, and legitimate SDK functions. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of Azure Service Bus lock renewal procedures, including handling renewal failures with callbacks. It securely retrieves configuration from environment variables, sends test messages, and demonstrates lock renewal logic. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system access is evident. The code operates within expected SDK usage patterns, focusing solely on message lock renewal management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign example demonstrating Azure Service Bus lock renewal handling, with no malicious intent or suspicious activities detected. It uses standard SDK practices for message handling and lock management, with proper async context usage. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
