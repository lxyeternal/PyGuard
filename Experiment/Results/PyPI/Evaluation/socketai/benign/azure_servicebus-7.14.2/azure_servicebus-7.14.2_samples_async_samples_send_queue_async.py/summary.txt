  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or security risks. All previous reports correctly identified its safe nature. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report could be slightly adjusted to 0, but it remains acceptable given the standard use of environment variables and network communication. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
