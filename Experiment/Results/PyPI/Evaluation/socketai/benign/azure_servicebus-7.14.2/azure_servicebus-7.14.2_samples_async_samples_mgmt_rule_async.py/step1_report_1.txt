{
  "purpose": "The script manages ServiceBus subscription rules by creating, listing, updating, and deleting rules through Azure SDKs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SERVICEBUS_TOPIC_NAME, SERVICEBUS_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME; user input for environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK functions that modify rules; no direct untrusted data sinks identified. No network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used to configure the connection; rule creation/update/deletion methods receive parameters that could be influenced by external data; however, no direct untrusted input flows into sensitive sinks in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; usage of uuid for rule names is standard; no obfuscated code or malicious constructs detected. No unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes environment variables for configuration, which is standard. It performs rule management operations via Azure SDKs, with no indication of malicious payloads or behaviors. There are no suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code injections. The use of UUIDs for rule names is benign. No obfuscation or malware-like activity is present. The code appears to be a legitimate management script with proper asynchronous Azure SDK usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Azure ServiceBus management script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply automates rule management tasks as intended without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
