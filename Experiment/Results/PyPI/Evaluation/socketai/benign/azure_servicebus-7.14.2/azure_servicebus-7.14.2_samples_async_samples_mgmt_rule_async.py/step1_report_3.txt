{
  "purpose": "This script manages Azure ServiceBus subscription rules, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting rules, primarily for administrative purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for configuration (SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SERVICEBUS_TOPIC_NAME, SERVICEBUS_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME), and uses Azure SDK functions which may involve network calls and authentication tokens.",
  "sinks": "Performs network communication with Azure ServiceBus, potentially sending credential tokens and rule configurations. No data leakage or suspicious data exfiltration evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Azure SDK network calls for rule management (create, list, update, delete) with credentials. No untrusted data directly influences sensitive operations; parameters are predefined or generated internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; usage of environment variables is standard. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with Azure ServiceBus management APIs to manage subscription rules. It uses environment variables for configuration, which is typical. The rule filters are constructed with parameterized SQL filters, reducing injection risk. The script manages rules asynchronously and cleanly. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage. The code is straightforward and aligns with intended administrative functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate Azure ServiceBus management script intended for operational purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware. It properly uses SDKs and environment variables without suspicious patterns.",
