{
  "purpose": "This code manages Azure ServiceBus subscription rules via the Azure SDK, performing create, list, update, and delete operations asynchronously using environment variables for configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for namespace, topic, and subscription names; UUID generation for rule names; SDK calls to Azure ServiceBus management API.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK methods that perform management operations; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks; no network activity outside SDK calls.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide configuration data; UUIDs generate rule names; SDK methods act as sinks for management commands; no malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward and uses standard SDK practices; no unusual data flows or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs legitimate Azure ServiceBus rule management tasks with proper use of environment variables and SDKs. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation are present. The use of UUIDs for rule names and standard SDK calls indicates typical management operations. No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations, and no network activity outside Azure APIs is observed. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for such management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure ServiceBus rule management utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate. The overall assessment confirms its benign, management-oriented purpose.",
