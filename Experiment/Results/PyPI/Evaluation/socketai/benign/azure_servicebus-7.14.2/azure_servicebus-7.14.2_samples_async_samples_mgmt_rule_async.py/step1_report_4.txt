  "purpose": "Manage ServiceBus subscription rules including creation, updating, listing, and deletion of rules using Azure SDKs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for namespace, topic name, and subscription name; Azure SDK methods for rule management; UUID generation for rule names.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK methods for rule creation, update, and deletion; printing outputs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → SDK methods for rule operations → output display; UUIDs generated and used for rule names.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code behavior; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Use of environment variables for sensitive info is standard but warrants cautious handling; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary SDKs and uses environment variables for configuration, avoiding hardcoded secrets. It performs standard operations for managing ServiceBus rules: creating, listing, updating, and deleting rules via SDK calls, with proper asynchronous handling. No suspicious patterns such as data leaks, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The use of UUIDs for rule names is benign. The code’s structure and flow are typical for Azure SDK usage, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Azure ServiceBus rule management tool with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely interacts with Azure SDKs without suspicious patterns or malicious logic.",
