{
  "purpose": "Manage ServiceBus subscription rules including creation, listing, updating, and deletion.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SERVICEBUS_TOPIC_NAME, SERVICEBUS_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME; user input for UUIDs.",
  "sinks": "Azure ServiceBus Management API calls which could modify or delete rules; environment variables used for namespace and resource names.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources; API functions perform create, update, delete, and list operations as sinks; flows occur from environment data to management API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious data. Usage of environment variables and UUIDs for rule names is standard. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with Azure ServiceBus management SDKs to create, list, update, and delete rules using standard API calls. It securely uses environment variables for configuration. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible; authentication is handled via DefaultAzureCredential. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, such as network connections outside Azure, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure and flow are straightforward and aligned with legitimate management operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate ServiceBus management tasks with proper use of environment variables and Azure SDKs. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended for standard management purposes.",
