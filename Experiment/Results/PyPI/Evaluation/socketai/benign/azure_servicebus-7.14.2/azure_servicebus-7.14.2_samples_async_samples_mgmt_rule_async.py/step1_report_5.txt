  "purpose": "Manage ServiceBus subscription rules including creating, updating, listing, and deleting rules.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE, SERVICEBUS_TOPIC_NAME, SERVICEBUS_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME; UUID generation for rule names; External Azure SDK functions for rule management.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data identified; no network connections or data exfiltration apparent within this code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and UUIDs are used as input sources; these are used to create and manage rules via the Azure SDK; no untrusted external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration, which is standard; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Azure ServiceBus rule management using the Azure SDK. It correctly uses environment variables for configuration, generates unique rule names with UUIDs, and performs rule operations asynchronously. No malicious patterns, backdoors, data leakage, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code does not include network calls outside SDK functions, nor does it handle sensitive data insecurely. It appears to be a legitimate management script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate ServiceBus management utility performing expected operations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses environment variables securely for configuration and does not contain suspicious code patterns or data leaks.",
