{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates receiving batch messages asynchronously from an Azure Service Bus Queue.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE' and 'SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_NAME' used to read configuration data.",
  "targets": "Azure Service Bus client operations; does not include any data exfiltration or malicious command execution.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used to configure the Service Bus client; messages are received and processed in a loop, with no untrusted data being sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; use of Azure SDK libraries is standard; no obfuscated or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The script securely uses environment variables for configuration, avoiding hardcoded secrets. It asynchronously connects to Azure Service Bus, receives messages, and marks them as complete, following best practices. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network exfiltration, data theft, backdoors, or code injection. The overall structure and library use are normal for a service bus message receiver.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard example of receiving messages from an Azure Service Bus Queue. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern could be reliance on environment variables, but this is typical for secure configuration. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
