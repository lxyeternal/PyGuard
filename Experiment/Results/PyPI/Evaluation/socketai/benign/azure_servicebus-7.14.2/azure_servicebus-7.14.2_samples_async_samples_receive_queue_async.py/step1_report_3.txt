{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates receiving batch messages from an Azure Service Bus Queue asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE' and 'SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_NAME' for configuration; the 'receive_messages' method as input source.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs message data to the console; 'complete_message' marks messages as processed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → ServiceBusClient initialization → message reception → printing messages → message completion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive info is standard; no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries for Azure Service Bus and identity management. It retrieves configuration from environment variables, avoiding hardcoded secrets. The main asynchronous function authenticates using DefaultAzureCredential, connects to the Service Bus namespace, and receives up to 10 messages with a 5-second wait. Received messages are printed and marked as complete. No suspicious data flows, code injection, or malicious activities are present. The overall pattern aligns with legitimate message processing workflows. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for receiving messages from an Azure Service Bus Queue, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
