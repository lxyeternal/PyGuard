  "sources": "Environment variables SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE and SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_NAME, SDK functions for receiving messages.",
  "sinks": "Printing messages to stdout, completing messages via SDK.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> SDK initialization -> receive_messages -> print -> complete_message",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for receiving messages asynchronously from Azure Service Bus. It employs environment variables for configuration, uses Azure SDKs correctly, and handles messages appropriately. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are detected. The code's clarity and adherence to best practices suggest a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure example of Azure Service Bus message reception with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are accurate and appropriate.",
