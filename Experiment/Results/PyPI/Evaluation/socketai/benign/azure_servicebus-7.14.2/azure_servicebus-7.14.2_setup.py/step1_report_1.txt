{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'azure-servicebus' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '_version.py', reads 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md' files, and gathers package info via 'find_packages'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files during package installation or build, but no explicit untrusted data sinks are evident in the setup script itself.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from '_version.py' -> uses regex to extract version -> reads markdown files -> calls 'setup()' with collected data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations, including reading version data and documentation files, then calling setuptools.setup() with proper parameters. No untrusted data sources, no network activity, no suspicious code paths. The regex for version extraction is straightforward, and the file reads are from local files only. No potential supply chain or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
