{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from '_version.py', reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "The setup() function uses untrusted file contents to construct package metadata; potential risk if files are manipulated, but no direct data leakage or untrusted input handling beyond reading local files.",
  "flows": "File reads (sources) feed into setup() parameters (sinks) to build the package configuration; no external data or untrusted input involved in runtime execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious functions present. The code performs standard setup operations without obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads static files ('_version.py', 'README.md', 'CHANGELOG.md') and uses the setuptools library to configure package installation parameters. It extracts version info via regex, which is a common practice. No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations are observed. The code adheres to typical package setup conventions and does not contain malicious or malicious-looking code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs package configuration tasks securely, relying solely on local files and well-known libraries.",
