  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the Azure Service Bus Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '_version.py', reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; configuration is static and used for package setup.",
  "flows": "Read version from '_version.py' -> Use in setup() -> Read markdown files -> Package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: extracting version info, reading static files, and configuring package metadata. No dynamic or untrusted input influences execution beyond reading files. No network activity, credential handling, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and follows common setup.py patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads version information and package metadata from static files and does not perform any dangerous operations.",
