  "purpose": "Set up configuration for building and distributing the azure-servicebus Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading _version.py for version info, reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, environment variables not used",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the code writes to package metadata and uses standard setup functions",
  "flows": "Version info is read from a file, then passed to setup() along with package metadata; no untrusted data flow detected",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, straightforward setup script",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs file reading for version extraction and package setup configuration. It reads version info from a file in the package directory, reads markdown files for descriptions, and passes this data to setuptools.setup(). There is no indication of untrusted input handling, network activity, or malicious code execution. All operations are standard for a package setup script. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical build configuration tasks without external or untrusted data influence.",
