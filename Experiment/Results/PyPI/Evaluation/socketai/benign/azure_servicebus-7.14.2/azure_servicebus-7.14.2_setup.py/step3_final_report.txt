{
  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the 'azure-servicebus' Python library, configuring package metadata, and reading version info from a local file.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '_version.py', README.md, and CHANGELOG.md files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs package metadata during setup; no untrusted data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads local files for version and documentation, then invokes setup() with collected data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script. It performs local file reads for version and documentation, then calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or suspicious patterns. Regex used for version extraction is straightforward. All signals indicate benign, standard package configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), justified by the benign nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
