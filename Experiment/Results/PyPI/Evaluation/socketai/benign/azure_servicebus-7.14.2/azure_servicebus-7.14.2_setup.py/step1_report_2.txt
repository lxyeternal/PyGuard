  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'azure-servicebus' Python package, used for package configuration and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '_version.py', reading 'README.md' and 'CHANGELOG.md' files.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function writes metadata to package distribution; no untrusted data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input sources (files) are read and processed into variables used in setup(); no flow to untrusted sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of standard setup tools and methods.",
  "analysis": "Code performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, reading version info from a local file, reading documentation files, and invoking setuptools.setup(). No suspicious or malicious behavior identified. All file reads are from local files for package metadata, which is typical for setup scripts. No network connections, code injection, or hidden behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate, standard setup configuration file for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. No malware or security risks detected based on the provided code.",
