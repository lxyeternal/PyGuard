  "purpose": "Demonstrates connection-string based authentication to Azure Service Bus using the azure.servicebus SDK.",
  "sources": "Reads the connection string from the environment variable 'SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION_STR'.",
  "sinks": "Uses the connection string to initialize ServiceBusClient; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variable -> Uses connection string to create ServiceBusClient instance.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; relies on environment variable for credentials, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, retrieves the connection string from environment variables, and initializes a ServiceBusClient asynchronously. The code is straightforward, purpose-driven, and uses standard SDK patterns. No malicious behavior or suspicious code segments are present. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard example of connecting to Azure Service Bus using environment credentials. No signs of malicious intent or security risks were identified.",
