  "purpose": "Demonstrates connection-string based authentication for Azure ServiceBus client using environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads the environment variable 'SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION_STR' to obtain the connection string.",
  "sinks": "Uses the connection string to instantiate a ServiceBusClient; no data sinks or external data transmission shown.",
  "flows": "Environment variable is read and passed directly into the ServiceBusClient constructor without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded credentials. The environment variable is used directly; no obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, retrieves a connection string from an environment variable, and creates an asynchronous ServiceBusClient instance. No user input is processed, and the connection string is stored externally, not hardcoded. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward example of service bus connection using standard SDK practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example demonstrating proper connection string usage with Azure ServiceBus. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. It is a typical, safe implementation for establishing a connection to Azure Service Bus.",
