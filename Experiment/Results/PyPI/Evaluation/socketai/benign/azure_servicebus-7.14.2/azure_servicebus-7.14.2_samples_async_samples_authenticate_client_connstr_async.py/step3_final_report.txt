  "purpose": "Demonstrates connection to Azure Service Bus using environment variable for credentials.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION_STR' read via os.environ",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code only initializes client",
  "flows": "Environment variable -> ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward SDK usage, no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves the connection string from an environment variable, then asynchronously initializes a ServiceBusClient instance. It contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The structure is clear, and the purpose is educational/demo. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The reliance on environment variables is standard practice, assuming environment security is maintained. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard example of connecting to Azure Service Bus with environment-based credentials. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
