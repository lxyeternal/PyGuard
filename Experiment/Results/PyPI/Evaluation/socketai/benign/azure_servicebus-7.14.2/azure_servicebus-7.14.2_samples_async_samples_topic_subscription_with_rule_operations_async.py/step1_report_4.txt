  "purpose": "This script demonstrates setting up Azure Service Bus subscriptions, rules, and filtering for message processing, including sending and receiving messages with specific properties.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SERVICEBUS_TOPIC_NAME' and 'SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE'; Azure SDK functions for creating/deleting rules, subscriptions, and messages; user input through environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Sending messages to Azure Service Bus; receiving and completing messages; creating and deleting subscriptions and rules.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → SDK methods for management (creating/deleting rules and subscriptions) → Message sending and receiving operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; all SDK calls use environment variables or Azure SDK credentials; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs; no network connections outside Azure SDK.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward example of managing Azure Service Bus resources, sending, and receiving messages with filters and rules. It uses environment variables for configuration, employs standard Azure SDK practices, and includes proper resource cleanup. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. The code does not perform any suspicious actions outside Azure management and messaging, and no hardcoded secrets are detected. The use of environment variables for sensitive information aligns with best practices. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign example for managing Azure Service Bus messaging with filters and rules. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It demonstrates standard usage of Azure SDK for message handling and resource management.",
