{
  "purpose": "The code manages Azure Service Bus topics and subscriptions, creating rules with filters and actions, sending messages with properties, and receiving filtered messages. It demonstrates standard Azure SDK usage for messaging workflows.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for configuration (SERVICEBUS_TOPIC_NAME, SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE), SDK functions reading message properties and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Message properties (application_properties, correlation_id) used for filtering; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Messages are created with properties, sent via ServiceBusSender, and received through receivers; rules with filters and actions are set via management client, with no external data flows outside SDK calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to SDK best practices.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Azure Service Bus management example, creating subscriptions and rules with filters, sending messages with properties, and receiving filtered messages. It uses environment variables for configuration, employs proper resource management, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. No network activity indicates malicious intent, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The code's purpose appears educational or demonstrative, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard Azure Service Bus operations. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
