{
  "purpose": "The script demonstrates managing Azure Service Bus subscriptions and rules, sending messages with properties, and receiving messages filtered by rules.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for service bus namespace and topic name; input messages created in send_messages() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is sent to external systems; message properties are used internally, and no data is exfiltrated or written to files or network explicitly.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → message creation → sending messages → message filtering and processing → subscription management.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code structure aligns with typical Azure Service Bus usage; no suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables to obtain configuration, follows standard Azure SDK usage for creating, deleting, and managing subscriptions and rules, and sends and receives messages with properties. It does not include any code that communicates with external or suspicious domains, leaks data, or executes malicious actions. The code's functions are straightforward, leveraging Azure SDKs as intended, and handle resource management properly. No unusual or malicious logic is present; the code performs administrative tasks and message flow simulations.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical example of Azure Service Bus management and messaging operations. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and aligns with standard usage patterns. No malicious or suspicious signals are detected.",
