  "purpose": "This script analyzes Ninja build logs to summarize the longest build steps, group them by file extension or pattern, and report on the most time-consuming build targets.",
  "sources": "Reads from the .ninja_log file, parsing start/end times, target names, and command hashes.",
  "sinks": "Outputs summaries to stdout; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads log data -> parses targets -> computes durations and weighted durations -> groups by extension/pattern -> outputs summaries.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a benign debug print statement ('print('{} > {}?'.format(self.weighted_duration, self.Duration()))') which does not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python utility for build log analysis. It performs local file reading, parsing, duration calculations, grouping, and reporting. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The debug print is harmless. The logic is standard and does not involve external communication or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign build analysis utility with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, and risk=0.0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
