{
  "purpose": "The script analyzes and summarizes the build times from a ninja log file, providing insights into long build steps and their durations.",
  "sources": "Reads from the specified ninja log file (.ninja_log by default), and accepts command-line arguments for configuration.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network connections; outputs results to standard output.",
  "flows": "Reads log file → parses build steps and timestamps → computes durations and weighted times → outputs summaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious file handling. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is primarily data parsing and reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a build log file to analyze build step durations and generate summaries, focusing on identifying long build times. It uses standard Python modules and straightforward data structures. No external network activity, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious file operations are present. The functions are dedicated to parsing and reporting, with no evident malicious intent. The code is well-structured and adheres to typical reporting patterns without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign build analysis tool with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It solely processes local log files and outputs build summaries, with no external communication or security risks identified.",
