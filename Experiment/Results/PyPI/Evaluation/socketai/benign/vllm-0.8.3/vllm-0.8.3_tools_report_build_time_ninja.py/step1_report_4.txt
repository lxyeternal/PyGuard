{
  "purpose": "The script summarizes build times and durations from a Ninja build log file, providing insights into build performance.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a file specified by --log-file or default '.ninja_log'. No external inputs are explicitly read apart from the file.",
  "sinks": "Outputs information via print statements; no data is sent over networks or written to insecure locations. No external commands or system calls are made based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the log file into Target objects, which are processed for timing analysis and summarized with printed output.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes debug print statements (e.g., 'print('{} > {}?'.format(self.weighted_duration, self.Duration()))') which are benign and do not affect security. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code strictly processes and outputs build timing info with no malicious payloads or hidden functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file reading, data parsing, and statistical summarization related to build durations. It validates the Ninja log version, processes target timing data, and outputs build step summaries. No external or untrusted data is used beyond the specified log file. The debug print statement is safe and for diagnostic purposes. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are present. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated sections or suspicious behaviors. The overall logic is consistent with a build performance reporting tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build timing summarizer with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It reads a local log file, processes data, and outputs summaries without external network activity or malicious actions.",
