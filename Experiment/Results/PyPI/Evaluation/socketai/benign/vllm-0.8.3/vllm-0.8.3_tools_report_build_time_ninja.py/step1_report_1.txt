{
  "purpose": "This script analyzes a Ninja build log file to summarize build step durations, particularly focusing on long build times and grouping by file extensions.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the specified Ninja log file ('build/.ninja_log' by default).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code primarily reads and processes log data for analysis and outputs summaries to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input from log file -> Processing functions (reading targets, calculating durations, grouping by extension) -> Output summaries to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code contains standard logging and processing logic with no obfuscated language features or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a Ninja build log file, parses build target start/end times, and calculates weighted durations to identify long build steps. It groups build steps by file extensions and outputs the top long-duration steps per group. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code performs standard file reading, parsing, and statistical analysis without external communication or suspicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for build analysis with no malicious intent or security risks present. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Its purpose is solely to analyze and report build performance metrics.",
