{
  "purpose": "The script analyzes Ninja build logs to summarize build step durations, particularly focusing on long build times per target type.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a specified Ninja log file ('build/.ninja_log' or user-specified).",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks or external data transmissions; no unsafe system calls or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Reads the Ninja log file, processes target start/end times, computes weighted durations, and outputs summaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily parses a build log file, calculates durations, and outputs build time summaries. It uses standard file I/O, string operations, and sorting, all of which are typical. No indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors, are present. The script operates solely on local build log data, with no external dependencies or unsafe operations. The code structure is straightforward, and no suspicious or malicious code snippets are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for summarizing build times from Ninja logs. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is clear and standard for its purpose.",
