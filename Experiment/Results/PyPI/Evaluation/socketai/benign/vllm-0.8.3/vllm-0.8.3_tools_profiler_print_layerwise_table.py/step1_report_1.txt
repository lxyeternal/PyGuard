  "purpose": "The script processes profiling data from a JSON trace file and prints formatted tables of profiling statistics for a specified phase and table type.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a JSON trace file specified by the --json-trace argument.",
  "sinks": "Uses the json.load() function to load data, and prints output to the console via TablePrinter. No untrusted data is written to external resources or system modifications are performed.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON data from file -> processes data into entries -> formats entries -> prints tables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Uses standard libraries and functions without obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads and processes profiling data with no apparent malicious behaviors. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or use of sensitive information. The code's purpose is straightforward: to parse and display profiling results. It relies on standard Python libraries, and the logic is clear and conventional. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for visualizing profiling data. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is well-structured and transparent, with no suspicious anomalies.",
