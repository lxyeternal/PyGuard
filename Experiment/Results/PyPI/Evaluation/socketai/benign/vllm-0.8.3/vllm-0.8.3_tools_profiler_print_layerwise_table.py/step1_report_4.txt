{
  "purpose": "The script processes profiling data from a JSON trace file, flattens hierarchical profiling entries, and outputs formatted tables for specified phases and table types.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON data from a file specified by the --json-trace argument; reads command-line arguments for phase and table type.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from the JSON file to generate formatted table output; no direct data leaks or external communication are observed.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON input -> processes and flattens profiling entries -> formats and outputs tables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses dynamic import from third-party libraries but does not perform insecure operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles input parsing, JSON data loading, data processing via flatten_entries, and formatted table output. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. The script relies on user-provided JSON files and standard libraries. The command-line interface appears legitimate for profiling analysis purposes. No suspicious or malicious activity, backdoors, or privacy violations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard profiling data processing script with no evidence of malicious intent. It safely loads and processes profiling data to produce human-readable tables. There are no security risks or malware indications.",
