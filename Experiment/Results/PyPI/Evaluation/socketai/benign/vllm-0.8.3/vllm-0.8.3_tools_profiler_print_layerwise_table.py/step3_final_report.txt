  "purpose": "Process and visualize profiling data from a JSON trace file, printing formatted tables for specified phases and table types.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON trace file specified by --json-trace argument",
  "sinks": "No sinks; data is only loaded and processed in-memory, no external data or network operations",
  "flows": "JSON file -> json.load() -> data processing functions -> table printing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward data loading and formatting",
  "analysis": "The code loads profiling data from a JSON file, flattens hierarchical entries, and prints formatted tables based on user input. It uses standard libraries and functions, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling. The only potential concern is processing untrusted JSON data, which could contain malicious payloads, but the code itself does not execute or interpret JSON content beyond data structures. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scores assigned in the reports reflect this understanding, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.2) in one report due to untrusted input handling, which is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for visualizing profiling data, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor risk pertains to handling untrusted JSON input, which does not constitute malware or active security threats. The scores assigned across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
