{
  "purpose": "The script processes and displays profiling data from JSON trace files related to model execution phases, providing summary or model-specific tables for analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a JSON trace file specified by the --json-trace argument, and loads it into memory.",
  "sinks": "Uses the loaded JSON data to generate and print tables; no direct data sinks such as network or file writes are evident beyond reading input and printing output.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON trace file -> loads data into memory -> processes data with flatten_entries() -> formats and prints tables with TablePrinter.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed. The code appears straightforward and primarily handles data processing and display.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and specific profiling modules, reads a JSON file, asserts phase validity, flattens nested profiling entries, formats string indentation based on depth, and prints tables. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The functions are well-defined and perform typical data handling. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a data processing and display utility for profiling results. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears legitimate and safe.",
