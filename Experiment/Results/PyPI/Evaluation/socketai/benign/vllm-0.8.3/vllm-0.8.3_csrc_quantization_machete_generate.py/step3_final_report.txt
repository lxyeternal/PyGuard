{
  "purpose": "The code is a code generator for CUDA kernels and related source files, utilizing templates and predefined configurations to produce source code for machine learning workloads. It manages filesystem operations to organize generated files.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations such as os.path.exists, shutil.rmtree, os.makedirs, and file writing; internal configuration data used for templating; no external or untrusted input read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "File creation and overwriting in the output directory; no network, subprocess, or external command execution; no dynamic code execution or external data injection.",
  "flows": "Configuration data and templates are used to generate source code files; filesystem operations write these files to disk; no external data flows or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no dynamic execution. Filesystem manipulations are standard for code generation scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs controlled filesystem operations to generate CUDA source files from templates based on internal configuration data. It does not accept untrusted input, execute external commands, or perform network activity. The code is straightforward, using templating to produce source code for machine learning kernels. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The directory removal and creation are standard in code generation workflows and are not indicative of malicious intent in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific code generator for CUDA kernels, with no malicious or obfuscated components. Its filesystem operations are controlled and typical for such tools. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0 and an obfuscation score of 0. The risk score is approximately 0.1 due to directory manipulations, which are standard in controlled environments.",
