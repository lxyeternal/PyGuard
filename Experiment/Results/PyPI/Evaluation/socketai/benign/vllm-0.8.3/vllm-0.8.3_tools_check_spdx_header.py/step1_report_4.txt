{
  "purpose": "The script checks for the presence of an SPDX license header in given files and adds it if missing.",
  "sources": "Reads files specified as command-line arguments, especially the first few lines to check for existing headers.",
  "sinks": "Reads and writes to files; no untrusted data directly influences external systems or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> Checks header -> Potentially rewrites files with SPDX header",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation, and no network activity. The script’s logic is straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code processes files to verify the presence of SPDX headers and adds them if missing. It reads each file’s initial lines to detect existing headers, then writes to the file if needed, preserving shebang lines. There are no external network calls, no data leaks, and no malicious payloads. The code’s functionality is typical for a license management tool and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is benign and intended for license header management. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its operations are limited to file I/O and string handling, with no evidence of harmful intent.",
