{
  "purpose": "The script checks for the presence of an SPDX license header in Python files and adds it if missing.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from files specified via command-line arguments. No other external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "File reading and writing functions (open, readlines, writelines, seek). No untrusted data processing or external outputs beyond file modifications.",
  "flows": "Reads file contents, checks for specific header pattern, potentially modifies files to add headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, no obfuscated or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and performs file checks and modifications based on header presence. It opens files for reading and writing, searches for a specific SPDX header pattern, and inserts the header if absent. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The script's logic is simple and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script designed to ensure SPDX headers are present in source files. It does not contain malware or security risks. It operates only on local files and does not perform any malicious actions.",
