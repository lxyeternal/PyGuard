{
  "purpose": "This script checks for the presence of an SPDX license header in specified files and adds it if missing.",
  "sources": "Input files provided as command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "File reading and writing operations, specifically in 'check_spdx_header' and 'add_header' functions",
  "flows": "Files are read to verify headers; if missing, headers are prepended by writing to the same file",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior or hidden functionalities; straightforward header check and insertion",
  "analysis": "The script reads specified files to check for an SPDX license header. It opens files for reading and, if necessary, rewrites them to include the header. The operations involve standard file I/O, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The logic is simple and directly related to file manipulation. No suspicious or malicious code is evident. The script does not handle any untrusted input in a security-sensitive context beyond reading and rewriting files, which is safe in this scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard file header verification and insertion task with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not exhibit malware or obfuscation.",
