  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the script as a straightforward utility that checks for an SPDX license header in specified files and adds it if missing.\n- They emphasize the absence of suspicious behavior, malicious code, obfuscation, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The analysis across reports indicates the code performs simple file I/O operations with no signs of malware or security risks.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and malware/obfuscated scores are 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code logic matches the described purpose; it correctly checks for headers and adds them if missing.\n- **Malware presence:** No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques.\n- **Security risks:** The only potential concern is that the script modifies files, but this aligns with its intended purpose and does not constitute a security risk.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — the script is a benign license management utility.\n\n### Justification:\n- Since the script performs only local file reading and writing, with no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns, the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero.\n- The risk score is also correctly zero because the script's purpose is benign, and there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The script is a standard, safe utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
