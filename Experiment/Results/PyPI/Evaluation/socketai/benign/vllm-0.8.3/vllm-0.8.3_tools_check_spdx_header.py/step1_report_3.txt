{
  "purpose": "This script checks for the presence of an SPDX license header in specified Python files and adds it if missing.",
  "sources": "Reads input file paths from command-line arguments, opens files to read their contents.",
  "sinks": "Reads files directly; no data is sent over network, written to sensitive locations, or used in unsafe system commands.",
  "flows": "Input file paths -> check and possibly modify files' headers -> output message and exit status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected. No obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file I/O operations: reading files to verify header presence and appending headers if missing. It handles files starting with shebang lines by preserving them when adding headers. There is no use of external libraries beyond standard Python modules, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The logic is straightforward for header verification and insertion, with no apparent malicious intent or malicious payloads. The only concern could be the modification of files, but that aligns with the script's purpose and does not involve malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for maintaining license headers in code files. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
