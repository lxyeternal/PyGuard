  "purpose": "Check for SPDX license header in files; add if missing.",
  "sources": "Reading files to verify presence of header; reading file lines.",
  "sinks": "Writing updated files with headers; modifying files in place.",
  "flows": "Read file -> check header -> if missing, write header at top of file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external network activity, no hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs simple file I/O operations to ensure SPDX headers are present. It reads files, searches for the header prefix, and prepends the header if absent. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or external dependencies. It modifies files directly, which is consistent with its purpose but could be risky if misused; however, this is not malicious. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for license header management with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The analysis confirms that the script is safe and the scores are accurate.",
