{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to ensure that source code files contain a specific SPDX license header, adding it if missing.",
  "sources": "Reads input file paths from command-line arguments; reads file content to check and add headers.",
  "sinks": "File reading and writing operations, no untrusted data processing or external data output.",
  "flows": "Input file paths -> check for SPDX header -> potentially add header to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; straightforward file header management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple file I/O operations to verify and insert SPDX license headers into source files. It reads files specified via command-line arguments, checks for the presence of a specific header, and inserts it at the top if missing. There are no suspicious behaviors, no network communications, and no data exfiltration activities. The logic is clear and standard, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for license management. It contains no malware, malicious intent, or security risks. Its purpose is purely to enforce license header presence in source files.",
