  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments with the code, and determine the accuracy of their scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SSE client with no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The risk score of 0.2 seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the context; it reflects minimal security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard event parsing, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk score is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SSE client, with no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with proper handling of content types and event data. The lower risk score (0.1) is justified, reflecting minimal security concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct; scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's functionality. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SSE client, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is aligned with the code's operations. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports, reflecting low security risk, which is appropriate given the code's functionality.\n\n### Final Personal Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is transparent)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard event stream processing)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurately score the code's security posture. No significant issues or concerns are identified.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The code itself appears safe, with no hidden or malicious behavior. The only potential concern could be external data manipulation, but that is inherent to event stream processing and not indicative of malicious intent.",
