{
  "purpose": "This code implements an SSE (Server-Sent Events) client to parse event streams and JSON data, yielding Event objects for further processing.",
  "sources": "Input stream '_event_source' providing chunks of data, headers from '_event_source.headers' for content type detection.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data effects; data is parsed and stored in Event objects without external transmission or execution.",
  "flows": "Data read from '_event_source' -> split into lines -> decode -> parse fields -> assign to Event object -> yield Event if valid.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected. Use of 'hasattr' for dynamic field handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads chunks from an input source, splits lines, decodes them, and assigns values to Event attributes based on field names. It ignores comments and unknown fields, and only yields events with data and event type 'message'. The handling of content types is standard, with no external network calls beyond input reading. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The logic is straightforward, with proper handling of line endings and event data concatenation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SSE client implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security flaws. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate given its functionality.",
