  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure-looking wrapper for Snowflake sentiment analysis functions, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main security consideration is ensuring 'call_sql_function' sanitizes inputs to prevent SQL injection. Given the current information, the overall security risk is low, and the code is safe to use if 'call_sql_function' is trusted."
