{
  "purpose": "Provide sentiment analysis on input text using Snowflake's LLM inference service via SQL functions.",
  "sources": "Input text from function arguments ('text'), potentially external data passed into the function, and session object for database connection.",
  "sinks": "call_sql_function executes SQL code which may involve untrusted input, and the output is returned as either a snowpark.Column or a float.",
  "flows": "Input text -> call_sql_function -> output (snowpark.Column or float).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The code is mainly wrapping existing Snowflake functions with telemetry tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code wraps Snowflake's snowpark library functions for sentiment analysis, with telemetry instrumentation. It verifies input types, calls a SQL function, and casts the output appropriately. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation or hidden code identified. The code depends on Snowflake's secure environment and external SQL functions, which are standard for such use cases. The only notable aspect is telemetry collection, which is not malicious but may have privacy considerations. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malware signatures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard wrapper for Snowflake sentiment analysis with telemetry, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
