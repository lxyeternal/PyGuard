{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper for calling an LLM inference service to summarize input text, integrating with Snowflake's Snowpark and telemetry systems.",
  "sources": "Function arguments 'text' (user input or data from Snowpark columns), external library calls, and possibly environment variables within imported modules.",
  "sinks": "call_sql_function function which executes SQL functions possibly using untrusted input; telemetry functions for reporting usage.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into call_sql_function via _summarize_impl, which executes a SQL function with this data. Telemetry calls do not process untrusted data but are for monitoring.",
  "anomalies": "Use of call_sql_function with user-provided 'text' could lead to SQL injection if call_sql_function does not properly sanitize input. No explicit input sanitization shown here.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a wrapper around a SQL function call, passing user-supplied data directly into a database function. The main concern is the potential for SQL injection if 'call_sql_function' does not securely handle inputs. Telemetry and deprecation wrappers are standard and do not introduce malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears to be a standard wrapper around a SQL function with telemetry. The main security concern is whether 'call_sql_function' safely handles untrusted input; this is outside the scope of the provided code but warrants caution. No malicious intent or malicious code patterns are detected.",
