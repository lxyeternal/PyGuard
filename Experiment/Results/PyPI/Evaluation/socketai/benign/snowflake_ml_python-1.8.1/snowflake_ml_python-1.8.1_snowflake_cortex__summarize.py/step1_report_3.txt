{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to summarize text input by calling an external SQL function, with telemetry tracking and deprecation handling.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'text' parameter, which can be a string or a snowpark.Column.",
  "sinks": "The call_sql_function executes an external SQL function, potentially involving untrusted input data, but it appears to be a controlled interface.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from the 'summarize' function into '_summarize_impl', which calls 'call_sql_function', passing 'text' as an argument.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on external functions like 'call_sql_function' and 'telemetry.send_api_usage_telemetry' which are not provided; however, their typical usage appears safe. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code itself is straightforward and lacks obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a summary function that delegates to a SQL function call, with telemetry for usage tracking. It includes a deprecated wrapper with telemetry, which suggests careful management of API evolution. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects, are present. The external functions are assumed to be standard or trusted based on context. The overall structure is simple and aligns with common API patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a summarization API with telemetry tracking. No malicious behavior or supply chain threats are evident. It is a standard, well-structured code snippet with no suspicious activity.",
