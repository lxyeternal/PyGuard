{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to call an LLM inference service to extract answers from text using Snowflake's Snowpark framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameters 'from_text' and 'question', which can be strings or Snowpark columns. It also accesses the session object and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "The call_sql_function invocation executes a SQL function, potentially processing untrusted input data. No direct data leak or external network access is evident in the code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('from_text', 'question') flow into 'call_sql_function', which executes the specified function. There are no additional data flows or external data transmissions shown.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Usage of deprecated decorators is noted but not suspicious. No hidden or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'extract_answer' that delegates to '_extract_answer_impl', which in turn calls a SQL function via 'call_sql_function'. The parameters are passed directly, and no data sanitization or validation is performed within this snippet. Usage of telemetry and deprecation decorators are standard. No external network communication, file operations, or system modifications are present. The code appears to securely invoke a Snowflake SQL function to perform LLM inference, assuming 'call_sql_function' operates securely. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this isolated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard wrapper for invoking a Snowflake SQL function to extract answers from text, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger system utilizing Snowflake's capabilities. The implementation is straightforward and does not introduce security concerns.",
