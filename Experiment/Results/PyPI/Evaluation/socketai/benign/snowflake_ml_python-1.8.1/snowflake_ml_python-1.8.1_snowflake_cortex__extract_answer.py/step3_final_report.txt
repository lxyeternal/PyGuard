  "purpose": "Wrapper function for invoking Snowflake SQL functions to extract answers from text, with telemetry tracking.",
  "sources": "User-controlled inputs 'from_text' and 'question' passed into 'call_sql_function'.",
  "sinks": "call_sql_function' executes SQL with inputs, potential for injection if not sanitized.",
  "flows": "Inputs flow from function parameters into 'call_sql_function' via '_extract_answer_impl'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper that passes user inputs directly into a SQL function call. It employs telemetry and deprecation decorators but does not perform any input validation or sanitization within this snippet. The main security concern is whether 'call_sql_function' properly parameterizes inputs to prevent SQL injection; this cannot be confirmed from the provided code. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The code's benign nature and standard pattern suggest low risk, with the primary caution being reliance on the internal implementation of 'call_sql_function'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured wrapper around Snowflake SQL functions for answer extraction. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The main security consideration is ensuring 'call_sql_function' handles inputs securely to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Given the information, the code is low risk and safe to use.",
