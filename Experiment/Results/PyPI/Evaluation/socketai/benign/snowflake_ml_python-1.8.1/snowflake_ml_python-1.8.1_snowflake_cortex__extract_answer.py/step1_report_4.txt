{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface to call an LLM inference service to extract answers from text based on a question, leveraging Snowflake's snowpark library.",
  "sources": "Inputs 'from_text' and 'question' which are user-provided strings or snowpark.Columns; also uses internal functions call_sql_function and telemetry for telemetry data.",
  "sinks": "call_sql_function executes a SQL function potentially with untrusted data; telemetry functions may collect usage data; no network or file system sinks observed.",
  "flows": "User input ('from_text' and 'question') -> call_sql_function (executes SQL with inputs) -> returns answer; telemetry functions record usage data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of telemetry functions that collect API usage data; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious API calls identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to invoke a SQL-based language model inference, passing user inputs to a database function via call_sql_function. The telemetry decorator records API usage. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized network activity. Usage of deprecated functions is noted but not malicious. No suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an API wrapper for Snowflake's LLM inference service, with telemetry logging. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected.",
