  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured wrapper around Snowflake SQL functions for answer extraction. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The main security consideration is ensuring 'call_sql_function' handles inputs securely to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Given the information, the code is low risk and safe to use."
