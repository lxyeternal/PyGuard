{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to classify text data using Snowflake's LLM inference service, with telemetry tracking.",
  "sources": "Inputs: str_input (string or snowpark.Column), categories (list of strings or snowpark.Column), session (optional).",
  "sinks": "call_sql_function executes SQL with function name, session, and input data, which could potentially lead to SQL injection if inputs are untrusted, but relies on predefined function names and parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data (str_input, categories) flow into call_sql_function via _classify_text_impl, which executes a SQL function call; session is used as context.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated decorator and telemetry tracking; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Snowflake's SQL function call for text classification, with telemetry and deprecation notices. No input validation or sanitization logic appears, but the function relies on predefined function names and controlled parameters. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. It appears to be a legitimate service interface with standard telemetry and deprecation management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for invoking Snowflake's classify_text functionality, with telemetry tracking and deprecation notices. No malicious activity or security risks are apparent based on this snippet.",
