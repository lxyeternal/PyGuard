  "purpose": "A wrapper around Snowflake's SQL function for text classification, utilizing call_sql_function with telemetry and deprecation handling.",
  "sources": "Inputs str_input and categories, which are passed directly into call_sql_function.",
  "sinks": "call_sql_function executes a predefined Snowflake SQL function, potentially involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "User inputs flow into call_sql_function, which executes the classification logic within Snowflake.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated decorator; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper that delegates to Snowflake's internal SQL functions. It uses standard practices, with telemetry and deprecation management. Inputs are passed directly to call_sql_function, which could pose a risk if inputs are malicious, but given the controlled environment and predefined function name, this risk is minimal. No external network communication or malicious patterns are present. The code's clarity and structure suggest no obfuscation or malicious intent. The reliance on Snowflake's internal handling reduces the likelihood of injection vulnerabilities, assuming Snowflake's functions are secure. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk ~0.2) are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard wrapper for Snowflake's classification functions, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low security risk score appropriately reflects the minimal inherent risk given the context. No malicious behavior or supply chain issues are evident.",
