  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward wrapper around Snowflake's SQL functions for text classification.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The use of `call_sql_function` with user inputs is standard but warrants attention for potential SQL injection risks.\n- Telemetry and deprecation wrappers are standard practices and do not introduce security issues.\n- The code relies on internal Snowflake mechanisms, which are presumed secure.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly identified.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes outdated code but no malicious behavior.\n- **Logic & Risks:** No signs of malicious code. The risk score is 0.2, which seems reasonable given the potential for SQL injection if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, which aligns with no malicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights potential risks with dynamic SQL, but notes no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Logic & Risks:** The concern about untrusted inputs leading to SQL injection is valid, but the code does not show explicit sanitization.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, which is correct.\n- **Score Justification:** The security risk is slightly higher (0.3) than in Report 1, possibly due to the dynamic SQL concern, which is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is cautious but justified. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Logic & Risks:** Recognizes the potential for SQL injection but notes reliance on predefined function names and parameters, which mitigates risk.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Score Justification:** The security risk score of 0.2 is consistent with the overall assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No issues.\n- **Logic & Risks:** Similar to previous reports; the use of `call_sql_function` with user inputs is standard but could be risky if inputs are malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Score Justification:** The low security risk score (0.1) aligns with the lack of malicious indicators.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Logic & Risks:** Same as above; no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Score Justification:** The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage.\n- **Potential Risks:** The main concern is dynamic SQL execution via `call_sql_function` with untrusted inputs, which could lead to SQL injection if inputs are not sanitized. However, given that the function name is fixed (`\"snowflake.cortex.classify_text\"`) and the inputs are passed as parameters, this risk is minimal within Snowflake's environment.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Scores are correctly set to 0.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.3) are justified based on the potential for SQL injection, but overall, the risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on internal functions and controlled parameters, a score around **0.2** seems appropriate, considering the minimal risk of SQL injection if inputs are trusted and properly handled by Snowflake.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None.\n- **Malware & obfuscated scores:** Correctly 0.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly conservative but justified at around 0.2.\n- **Overall:** The code appears safe, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\n**This aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.**",
