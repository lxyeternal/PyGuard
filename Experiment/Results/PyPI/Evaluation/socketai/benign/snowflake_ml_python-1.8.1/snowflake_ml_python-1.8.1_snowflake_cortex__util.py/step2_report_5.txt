  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the reports' conclusions, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is legitimate utility functions for executing Snowflake SQL functions, with no malware or malicious intent detected.  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, proper exception handling, standard use of Snowflake SDK.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Verdict:** **No issues.** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** The code supports Snowflake SQL function invocation but introduces potential SQL injection risks via string concatenation in `call_sql_function_literals`.  \n- **Findings:** The key concern is that `call_sql_function_literals` constructs SQL strings with user inputs without explicit sanitization, leading to potential injection vulnerabilities.  \n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies the risk: the use of string concatenation for SQL commands without input validation.  \n- **Scores:** Security risk at 0.5 is reasonable, considering the moderate risk of injection if inputs are malicious. Malware score remains 0, as no malicious code is present.  \n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** The reasoning aligns with the code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a standard utility with proper handling, and the only minor concern is dynamic SQL string construction, which appears sanitized.  \n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, proper exception handling, reliance on formatting functions for sanitization.  \n- **Analysis:** The report reasonably concludes that the risk is low, with no malicious intent or malware.  \n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.2 seems appropriate given the minor concern about dynamic SQL.  \n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with proper session handling and no malicious activity.  \n- **Findings:** Uses standard Snowflake APIs, no suspicious code, and proper exception handling.  \n- **Analysis:** The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, consistent with the minimal concern.  \n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Utility functions with potential SQL injection risk due to string formatting in `call_sql_function_literals`.  \n- **Findings:** The main concern is the lack of explicit input validation in SQL string construction, which could lead to injection if inputs are malicious.  \n- **Analysis:** The report correctly emphasizes the potential security risk.  \n- **Scores:** Security risk at 0.4 is reasonable, given the potential for injection. Malware remains 0, as no malicious code is present.  \n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree there is no malicious code present. The code is primarily utility functions for Snowflake SQL invocation, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.  \n  **Estimated malware score: 0**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports and the code are clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation detected.  \n  **Estimated obfuscated score: 0**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The main concern across reports is the potential for SQL injection in `call_sql_function_literals`.  \n  - Some reports assign a moderate risk (0.4-0.5), which seems appropriate given the reliance on string formatting without explicit sanitization.  \n  - The overall security risk depends on how inputs are controlled; if inputs are sanitized externally, the risk diminishes.  \n  **Estimated overall risk score: 0.4**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The code itself is legitimate, with no malware or malicious intent.\n- The primary security concern is the potential for SQL injection via `call_sql_function_literals`. To mitigate this, input validation or parameterized queries should be implemented.\n- No obfuscation or malware signals are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.4             |\n\nThe code is generally safe but warrants caution regarding input sanitization in functions constructing SQL commands via string concatenation.",
