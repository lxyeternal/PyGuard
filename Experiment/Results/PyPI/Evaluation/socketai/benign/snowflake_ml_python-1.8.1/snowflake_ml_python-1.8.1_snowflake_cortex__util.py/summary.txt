  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and well-structured utility functions for Snowflake SQL invocation. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is the potential for SQL injection in 'call_sql_function_literals' due to string formatting without explicit sanitization. The overall security risk is moderate and depends on the robustness of input sanitization. Scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and a moderate security risk (~0.4)."
