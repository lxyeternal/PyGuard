  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the associated scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is legitimate utility functions for invoking Snowflake SQL functions, with no malware or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity, proper exception handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis aligns with my review. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard Snowflake SDK features. No signs of malicious activity.  \n**Scores are reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code could be vulnerable to SQL injection, especially in `call_sql_function_literals`, due to string concatenation without explicit sanitization.\n- **Findings:** The main concern is the use of string concatenation in `call_sql_function_literals`, which can be exploited if user input is malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5, confidence=0.7.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a valid concern. The function constructs SQL strings via `\"SELECT {function}({arguments})\"`, where `arguments` are formatted with `format_value_for_select`. If `format_value_for_select` does not fully sanitize inputs, SQL injection is possible. The report appropriately flags this as a security risk.  \n**The securityRisk score of 0.5 is justified.**  \nMalware score remains 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior, just a potential injection vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard, with proper handling, and no malicious activity detected.\n- **Findings:** Dynamic SQL construction is present but appears sanitized. No suspicious network or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is consistent with my understanding. The code uses `format_value_for_select` for sanitization, which reduces risk. The low securityRisk score reflects minor concern about dynamic SQL, but overall, the code seems safe.  \n**Scores are reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard utility functions with proper session handling and argument formatting.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, proper use of Snowflake APIs, minimal risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, aligns with my analysis. No malicious signals, and the code is standard. The low securityRisk score is appropriate.  \n**Scores are justified.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions that handle arguments similarly, with potential for SQL injection if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Findings:** The concern is the string interpolation in `call_sql_function_literals`, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.4, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a valid concern. The code relies on `format_value_for_select`, but if this function does not fully sanitize, injection is possible. The moderate securityRisk reflects this.  \n**Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n\n- The **code is generally legitimate**, with no malware or backdoors.\n- The **main security concern** is the potential for **SQL injection** in `call_sql_function_literals` due to string concatenation with user-controlled inputs.\n- The **malware score remains at 0** across all reports, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as the code is clear and readable.\n- The **security risk scores** vary from 0.1 to 0.5, depending on the potential for injection vulnerabilities, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 (moderate, due to potential SQL injection if inputs are untrusted)\n\n**Note:** The actual risk depends heavily on input validation. If inputs are strictly controlled or sanitized, the risk diminishes further.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with my review. The main concern is the potential for SQL injection in `call_sql_function_literals`, but no malware or malicious behavior is present. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.",
