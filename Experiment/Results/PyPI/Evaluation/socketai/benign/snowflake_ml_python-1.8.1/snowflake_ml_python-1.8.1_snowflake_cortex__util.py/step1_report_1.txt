{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for invoking Snowflake SQL functions within a Snowpark session, supporting both immediate execution and column-based batch processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'function' name, 'session' object, and arguments passed to functions like call_sql_function and call_sql_function_literals.",
  "sinks": "Execution of SQL statements via session.sql() and return of collected data; invocation of Snowflake built-in functions and data transformation methods.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (function names, args, session) are processed to determine execution mode; in the case of literal args, a SQL query string is constructed and executed, with results returned; in column mode, function calls are passed to Snowflake functions for batch processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or secrets; use of standard Snowflake functions and session handling; no obfuscated code or uncommon language features; exception handling is appropriate. No external network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code validates session presence, converts arguments to Snowflake literals, and constructs SQL statements securely with standard functions. There are no signs of malicious code such as data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code handles exceptions properly. Overall, it performs legitimate SQL function invocation tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate utility functions for executing Snowflake SQL functions. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is well-structured and uses standard Snowflake SDK features. No malicious or suspicious signals detected.",
