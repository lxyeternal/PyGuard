  "purpose": "A wrapper function for Snowflake's translation SQL function with telemetry and deprecation handling.",
  "sources": "User-controlled parameters: text, from_language, to_language; passed directly into call_sql_function.",
  "sinks": "call_sql_function executes SQL with provided parameters; potential risk if not sanitized.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow from input to call_sql_function, which executes the SQL function call.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around a Snowflake SQL function, employing telemetry and deprecation. Inputs are passed directly to an external function without sanitization within this snippet. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The security concern hinges on whether call_sql_function properly sanitizes inputs to prevent SQL injection. Given the external dependency, the code itself appears benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper for a Snowflake translation function. The primary security consideration is the external function's input handling. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is low, around 0.2, assuming external sanitization is adequate.",
