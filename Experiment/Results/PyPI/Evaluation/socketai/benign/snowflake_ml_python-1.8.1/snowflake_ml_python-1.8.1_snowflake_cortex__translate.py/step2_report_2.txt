  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, scoring, and consistency.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward wrapper around a SQL translation function with telemetry and deprecation warning.\n- **Issues Identified:** None. No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis:** The main external dependency is `call_sql_function`, which is outside this code. The code itself appears safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2 (low, due to external call), Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score seems reasonable. No malicious activity detected. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar wrapper, with emphasis on the potential risk of passing untrusted inputs to `call_sql_function`.\n- **Issues Identified:** The main concern is whether `call_sql_function` properly sanitizes inputs. The code itself does not sanitize inputs.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The risk depends on the external function's implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.3 (moderate, due to potential SQL injection risk if `call_sql_function` is insecure).\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is justified, but since the code itself does not perform sanitization, the score could be slightly lower if external handling is assumed secure. However, in security assessments, assuming external function insecurity is prudent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, wrapping a SQL function call with telemetry and deprecation.\n- **Issues:** Same concern about external handling of inputs.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score aligns with the analysis; no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Wrapper with potential SQL injection risk if `call_sql_function` does not sanitize inputs.\n- **Issues:** Potential for SQL injection if `call_sql_function` is insecure.\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard; the main concern is external sanitization.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.3.\n- **Assessment:** The score is reasonable, considering the potential risk.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar, with no suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Issues:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no backdoors, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware score should be 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; should be 0.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Varies from 0.1 to 0.3, depending on potential SQL injection risk due to external function call.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is a benign wrapper around a Snowflake SQL function.\n- The main security concern is whether `call_sql_function` properly sanitizes inputs to prevent SQL injection. Since this is outside the code snippet, the risk is external.\n- The current scores are consistent with the analysis, given the information.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — 0.3, depending on assumptions about external sanitization. Given the conservative approach, I suggest **0.2** to reflect low inherent risk, assuming external functions are secure.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code itself appears safe; the main concern hinges on the implementation of `call_sql_function`. If that function properly sanitizes inputs, the overall risk remains low. If not, the risk could be higher, but there's no evidence here to suggest malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (adjusted slightly higher than the lowest due to external call risks, but still low)",
