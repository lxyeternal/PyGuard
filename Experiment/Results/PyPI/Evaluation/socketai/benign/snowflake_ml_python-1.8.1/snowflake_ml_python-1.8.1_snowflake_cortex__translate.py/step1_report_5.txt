{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function for translating text using Snowflake's LLM inference service, including telemetry tracking and deprecation handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'text', 'from_language', 'to_language', and 'session'; call to 'call_sql_function'.",
  "sinks": "The 'call_sql_function' likely executes SQL functions which could process untrusted data; no external network or data exfiltration apparent.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> call_sql_function -> returns translation; deprecated wrapper also calls telemetry and translate.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated decorator wrapping the main function; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns; code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a translation API that delegates work to 'call_sql_function'. It tracks usage telemetry and includes a deprecated alias. No signs of malicious code, such as network communication to unknown domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The parameters and function calls are typical for a wrapper around a SQL function, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign wrapper for a translation service within Snowflake's ecosystem. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The use of telemetry and deprecation wrapper does not introduce any security concerns.",
