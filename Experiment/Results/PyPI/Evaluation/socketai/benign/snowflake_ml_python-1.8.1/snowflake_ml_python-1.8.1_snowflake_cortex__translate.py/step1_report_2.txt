{
  "purpose": "Provides a translation function that calls an external SQL function for language translation, with telemetry and deprecation handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from snowflake packages, telemetry functions, and call_sql_function which is invoked in _translate_impl.",
  "sinks": "call_sql_function is the primary sink, which executes an external SQL function call with potentially untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (text, from_language, to_language) are passed to call_sql_function without sanitization, flow from source (function args) to sink (call_sql_function).",
  "anomalies": "Use of call_sql_function with dynamic function name and untrusted inputs could be exploited if call_sql_function is insecure; no input validation or sanitization is visible. The code appears standard, but reliance on call_sql_function is a potential concern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a translation function that internally calls call_sql_function with user-provided inputs. No evidence of hardcoded secrets or malicious logic. The function names and imports seem legitimate, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The primary concern is whether call_sql_function properly handles untrusted inputs, which cannot be verified from this snippet. The code also uses telemetry and deprecation wrappers, which are standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, implementing a translation wrapper with telemetry. The main security concern hinges on call_sql_function's internal handling of inputs, which is external to this code. There are no overt malicious behaviors or anomalies, but caution is advised regarding the external function call.",
