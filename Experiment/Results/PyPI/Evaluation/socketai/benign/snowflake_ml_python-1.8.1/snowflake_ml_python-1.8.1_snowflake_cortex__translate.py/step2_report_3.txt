  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\n- The code provides a wrapper function `translate()` that calls an external SQL function `snowflake.cortex.translate` via `call_sql_function`.\n- It includes telemetry tracking and a deprecated alias.\n- Inputs are passed directly to the SQL function without explicit sanitization.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The primary external dependency is `call_sql_function`, whose internal security handling is unknown.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Straightforward wrapper with telemetry and deprecation.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no malicious intent, no obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0.2 (low); confidence = 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No issues detected.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar wrapper, highlighting potential concern over `call_sql_function`.\n- **Analysis:** The main concern is whether `call_sql_function` handles untrusted inputs securely. Since this is external, the risk hinges on its implementation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0.3; confidence = 0.7.\n- **Verdict:** The cautious approach is appropriate. No malicious code, but the potential for SQL injection depends on `call_sql_function`.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, emphasizing the external SQL call.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; relies on external function security.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0.2; confidence = 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Similar, noting potential SQL injection risk.\n- **Analysis:** The primary concern is input sanitization in `call_sql_function`. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0.3; confidence = 0.8.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate, given the external dependency.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Confirming benign, standard wrapper.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; telemetry and deprecation are standard.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0.1; confidence = 1.0.\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign malware = 0, which is appropriate. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.3) are reasonable, considering the external SQL call could be a vector if `call_sql_function` is insecure.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High confidence in the assessments, given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The overall assessment across reports is consistent and reasonable.\n- The main security concern is the handling of untrusted inputs within `call_sql_function`, which is outside this code snippet.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — low, primarily due to external dependency concerns.\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe wrapper around a Snowflake SQL function with telemetry and deprecation handling. The security posture is acceptable, assuming the external `call_sql_function` is implemented securely. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
