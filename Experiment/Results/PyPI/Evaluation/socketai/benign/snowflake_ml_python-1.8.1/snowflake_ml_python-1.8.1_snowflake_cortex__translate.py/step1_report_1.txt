{
  "purpose": "The code defines a translation function that invokes an external SQL function to perform language translation, with telemetry tracking and deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'text', 'from_language', 'to_language', and optional 'session', especially from user inputs or external function calls.",
  "sinks": "call_sql_function invocation which may execute SQL code; telemetry.send_api_usage_telemetry could send data externally.",
  "flows": "Inputs flow into call_sql_function via _translate_impl, which then executes SQL; telemetry data may flow externally when the translate function is called.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated decorator; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; straightforward logic. No suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily acts as a wrapper around a SQL function call for translation, with telemetry tracking and deprecation warning. Inputs are passed directly to the SQL invocation without apparent sanitization or insecure handling. External telemetry might send usage data, but no malicious data exfiltration or backdoors are evident. No hardcoded secrets, no code injection risks from provided code. The external function call is an abstraction, so potential vulnerabilities depend on the implementation of 'call_sql_function', which is outside this code. Overall, the code appears standard, with no malicious intent or security risks present in the snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper for a SQL translation function with telemetry tracking. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected within this code segment. It appears safe with no apparent security risks.",
