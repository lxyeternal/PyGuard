{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and functions from the 'snowflake.cortex' package and defines an export list for module exports.",
  "sources": "The source code reads data from the 'snowflake.cortex' package modules during import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code, as it does not process untrusted input or output data directly.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to importing modules and defining the '__all__' list; no dynamic execution or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to use static imports and an explicit exports list, with no signs of obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes and functions from a library, then listing them in '__all__' for module exports. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing. It appears to be a clean, conventional module setup for a Python package. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and no anomalies or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script with no malicious behavior, no security issues, and no signs of obfuscation. It serves as an import and export setup for the 'snowflake.cortex' package components.",
