{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module interface, importing various classes and functions from internal snowflake.cortex submodules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from snowflake.cortex._classify_text, _complete, _embed_text_768, _embed_text_1024, _extract_answer, _finetune, _sentiment, _summarize, _translate modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols without processing data.",
  "flows": "Import statements (sources) lead directly to the __all__ export list, with no runtime data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward __init__.py or module interface with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static import/export module, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and minimal security risk. The structure is typical for a package __init__.py, serving as an API surface. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are present. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and safe. It functions solely as an API surface for the snowflake.cortex package, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
