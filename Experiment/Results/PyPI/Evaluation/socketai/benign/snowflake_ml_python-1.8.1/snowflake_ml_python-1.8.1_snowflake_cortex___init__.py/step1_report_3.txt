{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and functions from the snowflake.cortex package and defines an __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing functions and classes from snowflake.cortex submodules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code; the code only imports and exports symbols",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely import/export declarations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward module import/export setup",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of import statements gathering classes and functions from the snowflake.cortex package, followed by an __all__ declaration to specify module exports. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communications that could indicate malicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious activities are present. The structure is typical for a module interface file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module import/export setup with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified. It simply re-exports symbols from the snowflake.cortex package.",
