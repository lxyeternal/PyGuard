{
  "purpose": "This code defines module imports and exports for the snowflake.cortex package, facilitating access to various AI model classes and functions related to text classification, summarization, translation, and embedding.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and functions from internal modules within the snowflake.cortex package, specifically from files prefixed with underscores (_classify_text, _complete, etc.).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted input or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security breaches. No network, file, or environment operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely manages module imports and exports without executing runtime logic involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard package structure for defining exports. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and functions from internal modules within the snowflake.cortex package and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. All imports are from internal files indicated by leading underscores, which is a common pattern for internal modules. There are no runtime operations, data handling, or external interactions. The structure indicates a typical module initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface setup for a Python package, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security concerns detected. It does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited.",
