  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward import/export module, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code simply imports classes/functions from internal modules and re-exports them via `__all__`.\n\n2. **Potential Security Risks or Vulnerabilities:**\n   - Since the code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code, there are no apparent attack vectors.\n   - The reports correctly identify that this is a typical package initialization or API surface setup.\n\n3. **Scores Assessment:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable given the context.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting the clear, standard nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No evidence suggests any risk, so scores above 0.5 are unjustified.\n   - The minimal security risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are acceptable, given the context of package setup.\n\n5. **Potential Misinterpretations or Assumptions:**\n   - Some reports mention \"sources\" and \"flows,\" but since the code is static import/export, these are benign.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard module interface file, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is benign, serving as a simple API surface for the `snowflake.cortex` package. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a standard, safe module setup.  \n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
