  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports classes/functions from internal modules within `snowflake.cortex` and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No report mentions any dynamic code execution, network activity, handling of untrusted data, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n- The code structure is consistent with typical Python package initialization files, such as `__init__.py`.\n- The malware score is consistently reported as 0 across all reports, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - The code is purely import/export statements.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No dynamic execution, network calls, or data processing.\n   - All reports confirm the code's benign nature.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The import statements are standard, and the `__all__` list is correctly defined.\n   - No issues with code structure or syntax are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** 0 is justified; the code is a simple API surface declaration with no security implications.\n\n4. **Claims about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - All claims are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is not performing any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores align with the code's content and the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard module initialization file that imports and re-exports classes/functions from internal modules. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the consensus across all reports.",
