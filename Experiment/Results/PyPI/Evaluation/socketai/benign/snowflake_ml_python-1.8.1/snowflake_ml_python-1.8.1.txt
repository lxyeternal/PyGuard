The primary security concern is the potential for SQL injection in 'call_sql_function_literals' due to string formatting without explicit sanitization. The overall security risk is moderate and depends on the robustness of input sanitization. Scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and a moderate security risk (~0.4)."

The main security consideration depends on the internal function 'call_sql_function_literals' properly sanitizing inputs. Given the context and the code's design, the overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.2)."
