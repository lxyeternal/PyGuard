  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper for Snowflake Cortex fine-tuning operations. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The main security consideration depends on the internal function 'call_sql_function_literals' properly sanitizing inputs. Given the context and the code's design, the overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.2)."
