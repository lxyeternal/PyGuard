  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward wrapper for invoking a Snowflake SQL function for text embedding. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the SQL function invoked, which is outside this code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is low (~0.2)."
