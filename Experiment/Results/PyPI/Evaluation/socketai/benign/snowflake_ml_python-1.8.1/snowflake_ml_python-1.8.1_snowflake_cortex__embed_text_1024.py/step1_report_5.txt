  "purpose": "The code provides functions to call a Snowflake-based large language model (LLM) inference service to generate text embeddings.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: model, text, session; call_sql_function invocation",
  "sinks": "call_sql_function executes a database function which may process untrusted input data",
  "flows": "Input parameters (model, text) flow into call_sql_function via _embed_text_1024_impl",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious patterns; use of deprecated decorator is benign but noteworthy",
  "analysis": "The code defines a public function embed_text_1024 that calls an internal implementation, which in turn calls call_sql_function to execute a database function with provided parameters. The parameters are either strings or Snowflake column objects, and the session is optional. The purpose is to generate embeddings via Snowflake's ML inference service. The use of telemetry is for usage tracking. There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The function invocation appears standard for Snowflake's Python connector, and there is no obfuscation or unusual code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard wrapper around a database function call to generate text embeddings. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security issues. Its primary function is legitimate and safe, with no suspicious patterns or backdoors.",
