{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface to call an LLM inference service for embedding text, with telemetry tracking and deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'model', 'text', and optional 'session' for the functions; call_sql_function() is invoked with these parameters.",
  "sinks": "call_sql_function() executes a SQL function call, potentially affecting the database or data processing pipeline.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (model, text, session) flow into call_sql_function() which executes the embedded SQL function.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of deprecated decorator, no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code, standard telemetry and deprecation pattern, no obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a wrapper for calling a Snowflake SQL function to embed text using an LLM model, with telemetry for usage tracking and a deprecation warning for older function name. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are apparent. The function simply forwards parameters to a call_sql_function, which executes the embedded SQL command. The deprecation wrapper is standard practice, and telemetry integration does not pose security risks. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, straightforward interface for a specific database function call.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate wrapper around a Snowflake SQL function call for text embedding, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It employs telemetry and deprecation patterns responsibly. No malicious intent or security threats are identified.",
