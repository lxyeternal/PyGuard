  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward wrapper calling a Snowflake SQL function to generate text embeddings, with telemetry and deprecation handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The main concern is the potential risk if the underlying SQL function (`call_sql_function`) is malicious or compromised, but that is outside this code's scope.\n- **Verdict:** The logic is sound; no issues in the code itself.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard pattern, telemetry, and deprecation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is a typical wrapper.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—call to SQL function with telemetry, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; passing user inputs directly to a database function is expected behavior.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar analysis; standard wrapper, telemetry, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns; reliance on `call_sql_function` is typical.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard, safe pattern.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a straightforward wrapper around a Snowflake SQL function, with telemetry and deprecation handling.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent in the code itself.\n- **Security risks:** The main potential risk is the underlying SQL function (`call_sql_function`) which could be malicious if compromised, but that is outside the scope of this code review.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. Security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal inherent risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the straightforward nature, a risk score of about 0.2 is reasonable, mainly due to reliance on external SQL functions which could be malicious if compromised.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- The code is legitimate, well-structured, and does not contain malicious behavior.\n- The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the SQL functions invoked, which is outside this code's control.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided reports.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's straightforward nature.",
