  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for requests_gssapi.exceptions related to GSSAPI/Kerberos authentication errors.",
  "sources": "Importing RequestException from requests.exceptions",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only defines exception classes without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not handle input or produce outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The deprecated alias is a minor note, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports an existing exception class and defines two custom exception subclasses with descriptive docstrings. It also creates an alias for backward compatibility. No input handling, data processing, or external network interactions are present. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definition module for handling specific authentication errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured piece of code.",
