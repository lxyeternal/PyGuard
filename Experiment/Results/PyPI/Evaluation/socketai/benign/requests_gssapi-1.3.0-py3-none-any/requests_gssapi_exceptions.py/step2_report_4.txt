  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes inheriting from `RequestException`, imported from `requests.exceptions`. The code is straightforward, with no input handling, data processing, or external interactions. The deprecated alias is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \nNo errors or flaws are evident. The code is minimal, clear, and follows standard practices for defining custom exceptions. The deprecated alias `KerberosExchangeError` is a minor backward compatibility measure, not problematic.\n\n3. **Score Review and Justification**:  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign `0`. Given the code's nature—simple exception class definitions with no external code execution, no data handling, and no suspicious patterns—the malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign `0`. The code is transparent and not obfuscated.  \n- **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign `0`. The code does not process untrusted data, handle inputs, or perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:  \nThe reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, focusing solely on the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:  \nScores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n- The code's purpose is purely to define exception classes, which is standard practice.  \n- The deprecated alias is harmless and included for backward compatibility.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note**: The reports are thorough and accurate. The code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard, benign module defining custom exceptions for handling GSSAPI/Kerberos errors in the `requests_gssapi` library. No changes to scores are necessary.",
