{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for requests_gssapi, specifically related to GSSAPI errors during authentication processes.",
  "sources": "The code imports a standard exception class from 'requests.exceptions' and defines new exception classes without reading external input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; exception classes are standard definitions without logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code contains a deprecated alias for compatibility, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The module is a straightforward definition of exception classes inheriting from a common base exception. It includes a deprecated alias for backward compatibility. There are no input handling, no data processing, and no dynamic or malicious code segments. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exceptions with a backward compatibility alias. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
