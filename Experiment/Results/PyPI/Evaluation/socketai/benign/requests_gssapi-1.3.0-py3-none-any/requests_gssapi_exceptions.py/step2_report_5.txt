  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward: it imports an exception class (`RequestException`) from `requests.exceptions` and defines two custom exception classes inheriting from it.\n   - It also creates a deprecated alias for backward compatibility.\n   - There are no signs of input handling, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely defining exception classes with no data flow or external system interaction.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are zero for malware and security risk, and the code is just exception class definitions, this is appropriate.\n   - No adjustment needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing code, exfiltrating data, or manipulating the system.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is a minimal, standard exception class module.\n- The deprecated alias is benign and for backward compatibility.\n- No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No changes are necessary.",
