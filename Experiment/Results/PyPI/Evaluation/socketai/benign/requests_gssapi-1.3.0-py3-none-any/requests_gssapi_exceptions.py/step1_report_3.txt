  "purpose": "Define exception classes for requests_gssapi related to GSSAPI and SPNEGO errors.",
  "sources": "Import from requests.exceptions, and class definitions with docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, outputs, or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines exceptions and does not process or flow data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes inheriting from requests.exceptions.RequestException. The docstrings clarify their purpose. There are no input/output handling, data flows, or suspicious constructs. The deprecated compatibility alias does not introduce any malicious behavior.\n\nNo malware, malicious intent, or security risks are evident in this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module defining exception classes for request errors related to GSSAPI, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
