  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided descriptions.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes inheriting from `RequestException`, with no data handling, external interactions, or complex logic. The code appears straightforward and benign. No issues or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note the absence of data flow, input handling, or suspicious constructs. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident. The mention of the deprecated alias is appropriate and benign.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0. These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions, no data processing, and no embedded secrets or obfuscation, the risk scores are appropriately low. No justification for higher scores is warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior. This is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's straightforward purpose. No unwarranted security implications are inferred.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, harmless exception class module.** It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements, nor does it pose security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
