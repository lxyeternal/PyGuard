{
  "purpose": "Define exception classes for requests_gssapi.exceptions module, primarily for handling specific GSSAPI-related errors in requests.",
  "sources": "Import of RequestException from requests.exceptions; class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this code only defines exception classes without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward exception class definitions with a deprecated alias.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard exception class, then defines two custom exception classes inheriting from it, which is typical for exception handling modules. It also includes a deprecated alias for backward compatibility. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module defining custom exceptions for a requests_gssapi library. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
