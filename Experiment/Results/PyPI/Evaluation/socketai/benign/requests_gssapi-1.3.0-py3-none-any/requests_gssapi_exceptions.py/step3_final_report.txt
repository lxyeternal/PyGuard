{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for GSSAPI/Kerberos errors related to requests, facilitating error handling in the requests_gssapi library.",
  "sources": "Import of 'RequestException' from 'requests.exceptions'; class definitions for 'MutualAuthenticationError' and 'SPNEGOExchangeError'; deprecated alias 'KerberosExchangeError'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines classes and an alias without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecated alias 'KerberosExchangeError' for backward compatibility; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, static, and solely defines exception subclasses inheriting from a standard exception class. No input/output, network activity, or dynamic logic exists. The deprecated alias is benign. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module defining custom exceptions for GSSAPI/Kerberos error handling. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The existing scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
