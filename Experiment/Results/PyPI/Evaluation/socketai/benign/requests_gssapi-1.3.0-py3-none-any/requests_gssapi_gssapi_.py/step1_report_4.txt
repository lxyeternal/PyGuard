{
  "purpose": "The code implements an HTTP client with GSSAPI (Kerberos/Negotiate) authentication support, handling mutual authentication and sanitization of error responses.",
  "sources": "Reads response headers ('www-authenticate', 'content-length', 'date', 'server'), request headers ('Authorization'), and response content.",
  "sinks": "Sets 'Authorization' header for requests, modifies response headers and content, and releases connection resources.",
  "flows": "Extracts GSSAPI tokens from server headers; generates GSSAPI tokens for requests; authenticates server responses; manages request retries and mutual authentication; sanitizes error responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code. The code appears standard for GSSAPI HTTP auth implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs GSSAPI mutual authentication over HTTP, handling negotiation tokens, server validation, and error response sanitization. It uses standard Python libraries and gssapi, with no suspicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The response sanitization is for security, not concealment. There are no signs of hidden malicious actions or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of GSSAPI/Negotiate authentication for HTTP clients, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles authentication flows securely and sanitizes error responses to prevent information leaks. No malicious signals or anomalies are present.",
