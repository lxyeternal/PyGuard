{
  "purpose": "Implements GSSAPI mutual authentication for HTTP requests, handling token exchange, mutual validation, and response sanitization.",
  "sources": "Extracts negotiate tokens from 'www-authenticate' headers, reads response headers, manages request headers, and GSSAPI context creation and stepping.",
  "sinks": "Sets 'Authorization' headers, processes GSSAPI tokens, and handles response content and headers.",
  "flows": "Extract token from response header -> generate GSSAPI token -> insert into request header -> send request -> validate server token -> handle mutual authentication or errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls. Sanitization of error responses is standard security practice.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard GSSAPI/SPNEGO mutual authentication routines, including token extraction, context creation, stepping, and mutual validation. It sanitizes error responses to prevent information leaks. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines are present. Exception handling and logging are appropriate. The code relies on standard libraries and practices, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of GSSAPI mutual authentication, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. It follows best practices and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.",
