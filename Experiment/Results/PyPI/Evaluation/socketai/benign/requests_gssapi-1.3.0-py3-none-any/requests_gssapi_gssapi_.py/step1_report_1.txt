{
  "purpose": "This code implements GSSAPI-based HTTP authentication, primarily for mutual authentication with a server using the SPNEGO mechanism, via the requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters from class initializers and response headers; it extracts the 'www-authenticate' header for negotiate tokens.",
  "sinks": "It inserts 'Authorization' headers into HTTP requests with base64-encoded GSSAPI tokens; it also processes server responses and may sanitize error responses.",
  "flows": "The code extracts negotiate tokens from response headers, generates GSSAPI tokens, inserts them into request headers, and handles server mutual authentication via GSSAPI steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; the code uses standard libraries and approaches typical for GSSAPI authentication. Sanitization is limited to error responses, with no data exfiltration or suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard GSSAPI mutual authentication procedures, including token extraction from headers, context creation, stepping, and request signing. It sanitizes error responses but does not leak data or perform network actions beyond expected authentication flows. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious external communications are evident. The code adheres to common patterns for secure GSSAPI integrations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of GSSAPI HTTP authentication with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It securely handles mutual authentication and sanitizes error responses, aligning with expected security practices.",
