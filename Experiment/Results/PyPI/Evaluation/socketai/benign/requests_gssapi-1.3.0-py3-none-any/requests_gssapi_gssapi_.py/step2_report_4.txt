  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report claims the code implements standard GSSAPI mutual authentication, with sanitization limited to error responses. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activity is noted.\n- **Code verification:** The code handles token extraction, context creation, stepping, and response sanitization as described. No suspicious external calls or data leaks are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's behavior. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard GSSAPI mutual authentication, with proper handling of headers and responses. No malicious signs or obfuscation.\n- **Code verification:** The code performs expected token exchanges, context management, and sanitization of error responses. No anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Slightly higher risk, possibly due to the complexity of GSSAPI, but still reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities detected. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard mutual authentication implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Code verification:** The code's flow matches described, with proper token handling, response processing, and sanitization.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports; standard GSSAPI mutual authentication, sanitization of error responses, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Code verification:** Confirmed; no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: standard, secure mutual authentication with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Code verification:** Consistent with previous analyses.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or sabotage observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear, standard, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minor concerns primarily due to the complexity of GSSAPI and mutual authentication handling, but no significant vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — reflects standard security considerations for GSSAPI mutual authentication code.\n\n**Note:** The code's sanitization of error responses enhances security by preventing information leaks, which is a good practice.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2    |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's behavior.",
