{
  "purpose": "This code implements a GSSAPI-based HTTP authentication mechanism using SPNEGO for mutual authentication, primarily for secure HTTP client-server communication.",
  "sources": "Reads response headers ('www-authenticate', 'Authorization'), response content, response URL, request headers, and request body.",
  "sinks": "Sets 'Authorization' header in HTTP requests, accesses response content and headers, and potentially interacts with GSSAPI for token generation and validation.",
  "flows": "Extracts negotiate tokens from response headers; generates GSSAPI tokens; adds 'Authorization' header to requests; handles 401 and other HTTP responses to perform mutual authentication; may sanitize responses on failure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No suspicious or obfuscated code detected. Uses standard libraries and legitimate GSSAPI methods. No backdoors or hidden code evident. No network connections or data exfiltration routines observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard mutual authentication mechanism using GSSAPI and SPNEGO with proper handling of headers and response flows. It sanitizes error responses when mutual authentication fails, which is a legitimate security feature. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. It only manipulates HTTP headers and performs GSSAPI token exchanges as part of standard authentication procedures. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of GSSAPI/SPNEGO mutual authentication for HTTP requests, with no malicious intent detected. It follows best practices and uses standard libraries for authentication. No security risks or malware signals are evident based on the provided code.",
