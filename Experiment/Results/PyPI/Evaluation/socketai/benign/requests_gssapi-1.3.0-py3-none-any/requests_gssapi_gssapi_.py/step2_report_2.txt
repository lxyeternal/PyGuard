  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements GSSAPI mutual authentication, sanitizes error responses, no malicious activity observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code performs standard GSSAPI procedures, including token extraction, context creation, stepping, and request signing.\n- Sanitization applies only to error responses, which is a common security practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present.\n- The code is well-aligned with secure practices.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0, and the security risk is very low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements GSSAPI mutual authentication, standard procedures, no suspicious code, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code follows typical GSSAPI SPNEGO authentication flows.\n- No hardcoded credentials or obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n- Sanitization of error responses is a security feature, not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment and scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements GSSAPI mutual authentication, standard approach, no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code uses standard GSSAPI token exchange, header manipulation, and mutual authentication.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors.\n- Sanitization of error responses is appropriate security practice.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment and scores are appropriate and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** GSSAPI mutual authentication, handles mutual auth, sanitizes error responses, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code performs expected mutual authentication flows.\n- No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Sanitization is for security, not malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scoring are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements GSSAPI mutual authentication, handles tokens, sanitizes errors, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard implementation.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- Sanitization improves security, not maliciousness.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify that the code implements standard GSSAPI mutual authentication without malicious intent.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None apparent; all reports are consistent, thorough, and reasonable.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, obfuscated scores are 0, reflecting no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low (0.1–0.2), aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Confidence levels:** 0.9 across all reports, justified given the clear, standard implementation.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal security risk, primarily due to the complexity of GSSAPI, but no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors)\n\n**Note:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of GSSAPI mutual authentication for HTTP, with appropriate sanitization and no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate, and their scoring is justified.
