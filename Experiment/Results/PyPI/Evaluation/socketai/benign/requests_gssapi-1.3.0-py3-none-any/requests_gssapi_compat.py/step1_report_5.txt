  "purpose": "Compatibility shim for older Python versions and requests_kerberos integration with GSSAPI",
  "sources": "Imports sys, gssapi, and local module .gssapi_; uses sys.version_info, gssapi.Name, gssapi.Credentials, gssapi.NameType, and gssapi.exceptions.GSSError; reads parameters in class methods and constructors",
  "sinks": "Calls gssapi.Name, gssapi.Credentials, and raises SPNEGOExchangeError; logs exceptions; generates request headers",
  "flows": "Initialization of credentials and SPNEGO name in generate_request_header() based on input host and principal; exception handling flow for GSSError",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code; no hidden network connections or system modifications; use of gssapi library for authentication",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a compatibility layer and manages GSSAPI-based Kerberos authentication. It dynamically creates credentials and target names for the GSSAPI context, handling exceptions and logging failures. There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious code, or backdoors. Usage of external libraries is appropriate for the purpose. The code does not include any suspicious network activity, hidden behaviors, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate compatibility and authentication helper for Kerberos with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is well-structured, with proper exception handling and logging. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
