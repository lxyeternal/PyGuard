  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a kerberos authentication compatibility layer. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
