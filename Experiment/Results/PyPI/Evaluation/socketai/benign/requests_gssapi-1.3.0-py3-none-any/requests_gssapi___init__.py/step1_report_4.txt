{
  "purpose": "Provides an HTTP library extension supporting GSSAPI authentication, specifically integrating with requests for mutual authentication using Kerberos or SPNEGO.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .compat, .exceptions, and .gssapi_. These are internal modules and do not indicate data input sources outside the code itself.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily imports and sets up logging and module exports without handling untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is mainly defining imports, constants, and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is mainly documentation and module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a requests GSSAPI authentication library. It imports dependencies, sets up logging, defines exported symbols, and specifies a version. There are no functions, data handling, or potentially malicious operations. The imports from local modules suggest that core logic exists elsewhere, but this file alone contains no suspicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup and documentation file with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves as an interface for GSSAPI authentication support in requests.",
