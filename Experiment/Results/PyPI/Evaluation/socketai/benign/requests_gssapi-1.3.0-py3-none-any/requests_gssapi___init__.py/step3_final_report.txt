  "purpose": "Module initialization for a Python package extending requests with GSSAPI/Kerberos support, setting up imports, logging, and API exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.compat, .exceptions, .gssapi_), setting up logging, defining __all__ and __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and setup flow from module import to logging configuration and API exposure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and contains no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script for a Python package that adds GSSAPI authentication support to requests. It performs standard imports, configures logging with NullHandler to prevent logging issues, defines API exports, and specifies a version. There are no data processing, network activity, or embedded secrets. The imported modules may contain complex logic, but within this snippet, only setup and interface exposure are visible. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
