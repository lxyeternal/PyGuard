{
  "purpose": "Provides HTTP GSSAPI/Kerberos authentication support via the requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (.compat, .exceptions, .gssapi_), which may contain functionality or data for authentication.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; code mainly imports and exposes classes/constants.",
  "flows": "Imports modules, assigns logging handler, defines __all__ and __version__, and exposes API components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard module setup and interface exposure.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging, imports relevant modules for GSSAPI authentication support, and defines the public API. It does not process user input, handle data, or perform network operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The imported modules could contain more complex behavior, but within this snippet, only standard import and setup are performed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for a requests GSSAPI authentication library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily exports functions and constants for use in other modules.",
