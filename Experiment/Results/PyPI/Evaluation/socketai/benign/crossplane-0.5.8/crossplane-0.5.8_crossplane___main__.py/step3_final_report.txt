{
  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface for parsing, building, lexing, minifying, and formatting nginx configuration files and related JSON payloads.",
  "sources": "File reads (e.g., open(filename)), user input prompts (input()), command-line arguments, and JSON data parsing.",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON payloads to files or stdout, printing messages, and user prompts for overwriting files.",
  "flows": "Input files are read, processed through parsing or building functions, and output is written to files or stdout. User prompts influence whether files are overwritten.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Use of input() for prompts is standard but could be misused in non-interactive environments; however, this is typical for CLI tools and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility for managing nginx configs, with clear separation of concerns and standard library usage. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. User prompts are typical and safe. The code handles files securely and performs expected operations without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign command-line tool with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
