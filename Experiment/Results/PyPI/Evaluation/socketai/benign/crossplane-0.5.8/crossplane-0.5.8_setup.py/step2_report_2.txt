  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging and uploading a Python package.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration is detected.\n- The primary concern is the use of `os.system` to execute shell commands, which could pose security risks if inputs were manipulated, but in this case, commands are static.\n- The package metadata is sourced from the `crossplane` module, which appears to be a normal practice.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of `os.system` calls**: They are used to run build and upload commands. While typical in setup scripts, they are less secure than subprocess modules. However, in this context, commands are static, so the risk is minimal.\n- **No user input validation or sanitization**: Since commands are hardcoded, this is not a significant concern here.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Use of `os.system` instead of `subprocess`**: Not a security flaw per se, but a best practice. This is acknowledged in the reports.\n- **Potential for command injection if inputs were manipulated**: Not applicable here, as commands are static.\n\n### Scores and Reasonableness:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent and appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the minimal risk posed by the use of `os.system` with static commands.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1.0), which is justified.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n\n### Potential Improvements:\n- Replace `os.system` with `subprocess.run` for better security and control, but this does not change the current security assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, typical for build scripts using system commands)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, due to use of `os.system` but no malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, non-malicious setup script with minor security considerations related to command execution methods. No supply chain security risks or malware are evident.",
