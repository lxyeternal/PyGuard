  "purpose": "A setup.py script for packaging and uploading a Python project, including a custom upload command.",
  "sources": "Static shell commands executed via os.system() for build and upload processes.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands via os.system(), which could potentially be exploited if inputs were manipulated, but in this code, commands are static.",
  "flows": "The script calls os.system() with fixed commands to remove previous builds, build distributions, and upload to PyPI, with no user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() instead of subprocess for executing shell commands; no input sanitization or validation; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; straightforward code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with a custom command for uploading packages. It relies on static commands executed via os.system(), which is less secure than subprocess but acceptable here due to the static nature of commands. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The package metadata is imported from the crossplane module. The risk associated with this code is minimal, primarily due to the use of os.system(), but since commands are fixed, the potential for exploitation is very low. The malware score is correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The security risk score is slightly above zero (around 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the minor security concern of using os.system(), but overall, the code is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, non-malicious setup script with no signs of supply chain attack, malware, or obfuscation. The minor security concern related to os.system() is acknowledged but does not elevate the risk significantly. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
