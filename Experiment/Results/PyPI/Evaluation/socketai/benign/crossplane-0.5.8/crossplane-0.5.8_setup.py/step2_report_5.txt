  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no backdoors, standard packaging script. Uses os.system for command execution, which is common but less secure than subprocess.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the benign nature but note the use of os.system.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard packaging code, no malicious intent, no hardcoded secrets, uses os.system.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Slightly lower risk score aligns with the lack of potential issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup script, no malicious activity, uses os.system.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusions; straightforward setup script, no suspicious code, uses os.system.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious code, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or backdoors. The use of os.system is typical but could be improved for security; however, in this context, it doesn't constitute malware.\n- **Obfuscation:** None of the code snippets are obfuscated.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the nature of the code—standard setup and packaging scripts with minimal security concerns—the risk scores are slightly conservative but acceptable. The main concern is the use of os.system, which could be exploited if inputs were manipulated, but here, commands are static.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores for malware should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- Obfuscation should stay at 0.\n- The risk scores could be marginally lowered to 0.1, reflecting the minimal inherent risk in such scripts, especially since commands are static and no user input is involved.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- No signs of supply chain malware, backdoors, or malicious activity.\n- Use of os.system is a common pattern but not inherently malicious.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| **0**          | **0**             | **0.1**  |\n\nThis reflects a benign, standard packaging script with negligible security risk, and no malware or obfuscation detected.",
