{
  "purpose": "This script is for packaging and distributing a Python project, including building distributions and uploading to PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem (README.md), environment variables (sys.executable), and uses imported package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system to run shell commands for building and uploading packages, which could execute arbitrary commands if inputs were manipulated.",
  "flows": "The code constructs shell commands with sys.executable and runs them via os.system during the upload process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses standard setuptools functionality and a custom command for upload. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports package metadata from crossplane, retrieves the README file, and defines a custom upload command that removes previous build directories and runs setup and Twine upload commands via os.system. The setup() function configures package details and entry points. The use of os.system with sys.executable is typical for such build scripts and does not indicate malicious intent. There are no hidden or suspicious code blocks, hardcoded secrets, or external data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of os.system is controlled and predictable within the context of a build script, and no malicious activity such as data exfiltration or backdoors is evident.",
