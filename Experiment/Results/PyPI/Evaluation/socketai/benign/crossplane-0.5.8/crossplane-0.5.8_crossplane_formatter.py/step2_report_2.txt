  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward configuration parser and formatter.\n- It imports functions and classes from local modules (`errors`, `builder`, `parser`) and does not contain any inline malicious code.\n- No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is evident.\n- The flow is simple: parse input, check for errors, build output.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n- The exception handling is standard for parsing errors.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Malware and Risk Scores Justification**\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n\n- Malware: 0 in all reports\n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (mostly consistent, indicating low but non-zero concern)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct, no obfuscation detected)\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The external modules are unknown, but based on this snippet alone, no malicious behavior is evident.\n- The risk score of 0.2 is conservative but acceptable, considering external modules could have vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are reasonable and justified given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Potential Flaws or Misinterpretations**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- They do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions are made.\n\n**Note:**  \nThe reports correctly avoid overestimating risk or malware potential.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specific points about the code logic and scores**\n\n- The code does not perform any dangerous operations.\n- It relies on external modules (`errors`, `builder`, `parser`), which could theoretically contain issues, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- The exception handling is appropriate, and no suspicious data flows are present.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores for malware should remain at 0; risk scores can stay at 0.2, as they reflect minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Final estimation**\n\n**Based on all reports and the code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to external dependencies and potential undisclosed issues)\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a typical configuration parser and formatter with no signs of malicious behavior. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware score should be zero unless external modules are compromised, which cannot be inferred here.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Score | Justification                                                                                   |\n|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious activity or code injection present in the snippet.                              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code without obfuscation.                                               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2               | Slight concern due to reliance on external modules; no evident vulnerabilities in this code. |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider external modules' security posture, but based solely on this code snippet, the overall security profile is benign.",
