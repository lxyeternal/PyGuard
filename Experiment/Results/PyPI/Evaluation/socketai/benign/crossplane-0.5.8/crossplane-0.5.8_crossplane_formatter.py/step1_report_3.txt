{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to parse and format configuration files, likely for a specific application or system, by calling external parse and build functions.",
  "sources": "Reads the filename parameter for input, and receives payloads from the parse function, which processes the file content.",
  "sinks": "Returns the output generated by the build function; raises exceptions if parsing errors occur.",
  "flows": "Reads filename -> parse() processing input file -> checks payload status -> raises exception if error -> processes parsed data -> build() generates formatted output -> return output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code appears to rely on external functions for parsing and building; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly uses external modules (.errors, .builder, .parser). It calls parse() with specific parameters, checks for errors in the payload, raises an exception if parsing fails, then builds formatted output from parsed data. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The functions and flow are typical for configuration processing scripts. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or suspicious control flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard configuration file parser and formatter with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply delegates parsing and formatting to external modules and handles errors gracefully.",
