  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard nginx configuration lexer with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the external lexers extension point, which could be exploited if malicious code is registered externally, but the core code itself is safe. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
