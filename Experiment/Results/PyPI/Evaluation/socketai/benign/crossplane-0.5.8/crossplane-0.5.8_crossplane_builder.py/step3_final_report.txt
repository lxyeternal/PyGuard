  "sources": "JSON payloads, file paths, external builder functions",
  "sinks": "File system (writing config files), directory creation",
  "flows": "Payload data -> string escaping/quoting -> config block construction -> file output",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'decode('string-escape')' in Python 2 for escape sequences; reliance on external builder registration which could be misused if malicious builders are registered",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward nginx config generator that processes structured JSON payloads into configuration files, with support for nested blocks and external builder functions. It performs string escaping and quoting to ensure valid syntax. No network activity, code execution, or credential handling is present. The use of 'decode('string-escape')' in Python 2 could interpret escape sequences from untrusted input, posing a minor risk, but does not execute code or perform malicious actions. The external builder registration mechanism, while potentially exploitable if malicious builders are registered, is an intended extension point and not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is benign, with the main security consideration being the trustworthiness of external builders. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal risk due to extensibility points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate nginx configuration generator with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Its primary risk stems from the external builder extension point, which should be managed carefully. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
