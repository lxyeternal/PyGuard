  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an nginx parser with detailed error information",
  "sources": "Code itself, specifically the exception class initializers and string representations",
  "sinks": "String conversion method (__str__) that formats exception details for display or logging",
  "flows": "Initialization of exception objects -> __str__ method for generating error messages",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no use of dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no external data sources or sinks observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for parsing errors, with detailed error information stored as attributes. The __str__ method formats these attributes for output. No external data input/output, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward and typical for custom exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for a parser and contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It is purely structural and descriptive with no suspicious operations.",
