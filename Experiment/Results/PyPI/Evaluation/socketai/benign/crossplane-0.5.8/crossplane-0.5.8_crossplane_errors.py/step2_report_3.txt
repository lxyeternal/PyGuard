  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions related to an nginx parser. There are no signs of input handling, network operations, data processing, or other suspicious activities. The code is straightforward and standard for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies or malicious behaviors. They do not identify any logical errors or security flaws in the class definitions themselves. The descriptions are consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - *Obfuscated*: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - *Malware*: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n   - *Security Risk*: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.  \n   \n   These scores seem reasonable given the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports assign a risk score of 0, and the code is just exception class definitions with no external or dynamic behaviors, raising the risk score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected or suggested.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent. They correctly interpret the code as standard exception handling classes.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for an nginx parser. It contains no obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall conclusion**: The code is safe, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
