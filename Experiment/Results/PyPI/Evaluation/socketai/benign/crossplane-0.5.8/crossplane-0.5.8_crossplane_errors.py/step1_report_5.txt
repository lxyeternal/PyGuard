  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an nginx parser with detailed error information.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constructors, no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, external connections, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class initializations are self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception, with customized __init__ and __str__ methods for detailed error messaging. No external data input, environment variable usage, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to serve as a structured error handling framework for an nginx configuration parser.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated elements. It performs standard error handling setup without any suspicious behavior.",
