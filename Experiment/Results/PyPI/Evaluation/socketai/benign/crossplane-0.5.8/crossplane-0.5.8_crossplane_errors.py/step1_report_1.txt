  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an Nginx parser, including various specific error types.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code solely defines classes and methods.",
  "kills": "No sinks for untrusted data or external output; no data processing or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; classes are only used for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. The constructor initializes attributes related to error message, filename, and line number. The __str__ method formats the error message with filename and line number if available. No input handling, network operations, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code appears to be straightforward class definitions for error handling within a parser context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining exception classes for parsing errors and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard implementation without any security risks.",
