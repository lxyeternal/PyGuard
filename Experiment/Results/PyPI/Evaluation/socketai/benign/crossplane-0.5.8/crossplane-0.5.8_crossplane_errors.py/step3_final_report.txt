  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for an nginx parser to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "Class constructors (__init__) where error details are stored; __str__ method formatting error messages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Error details flow from initialization to string representation for error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's Exception. The __init__ method stores error information, and __str__ formats messages. There are no external data inputs, network operations, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code is simple, standard, and purely structural for error handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The scores are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for an nginx parser, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
