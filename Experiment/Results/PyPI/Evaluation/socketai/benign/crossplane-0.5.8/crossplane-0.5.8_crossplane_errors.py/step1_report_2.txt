  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an nginx parser, handling various error types.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class initializers and string representations do not read untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions with external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception classes and inheritance is standard; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for parsing errors. It includes an init method that stores error details and a __str__ method for string representation. The structure is typical for error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data access, or obfuscated code. No suspicious patterns or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in a parser. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data processing, and no security risks.",
