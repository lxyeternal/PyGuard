  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n- All reports agree that the code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for an nginx parser.\n- They note that the code is straightforward, with no external data input/output, no network or file operations, no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence level is high (1) across all reports.\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, indicating no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n**Step-by-step evaluation:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions for exceptions.\n   - No input handling, no data processing, no external interactions.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as standard exception class definitions.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which seems appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n   - No reason to suggest score adjustments.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - The code does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - Scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's content, not assumptions.\n   - No unwarranted claims detected.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features, I agree with the provided assessments.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for an nginx parser, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and the analysis is sound.",
