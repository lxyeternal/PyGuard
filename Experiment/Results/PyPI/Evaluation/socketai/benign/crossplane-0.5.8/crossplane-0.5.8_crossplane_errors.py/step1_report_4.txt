  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an Nginx parser, including base and specific error types.",
  "sources": "No external input or data read; exception classes are defined statically.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no output or data leak points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes do not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception class definitions for a parser, with a constructor initializing error details and string representation methods. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external interactions. No indications of malicious intent or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and appears to be part of a larger parser implementation.",
