  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to an Nginx parser.\n   - No input/output handling, network operations, or data processing occurs.\n   - The classes initialize error details and format messages, which is standard practice.\n   - No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is straightforward and does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.\n   - No logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely structural, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - Since no malicious activity is present, malware scores of 0 are correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts that the code is simple class definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for an Nginx parser. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
