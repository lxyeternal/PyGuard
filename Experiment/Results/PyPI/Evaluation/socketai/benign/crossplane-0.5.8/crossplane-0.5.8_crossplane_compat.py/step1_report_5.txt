{
  "purpose": "The code sets up compatibility between Python 2 and 3, handles JSON import, and defines a decorator to fix PEP 479 issues in generators.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'json' and 'simplejson', sys.version_info, input functions, and the generator function inside 'fix_pep_479'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up environment compatibility and a generator wrapper.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The try-except import for json is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with imports and Python version detection, which is standard. It then defines 'fix_pep_479', a decorator that wraps a generator to handle RuntimeError exceptions, likely related to PEP 479 issues in Python 3.7. There are no indications of malicious intent or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward, intended for compatibility and stability purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign compatibility utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages environment differences and provides a generator wrapper to handle specific runtime errors.",
