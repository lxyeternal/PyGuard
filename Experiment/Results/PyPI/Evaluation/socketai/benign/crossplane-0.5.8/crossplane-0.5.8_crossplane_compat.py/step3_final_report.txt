{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, including JSON import fallback and a generator wrapper to handle RuntimeError related to PEP 479.",
  "sources": "sys module for version detection, import of simplejson or json, no untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, external data handling, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility module aimed at ensuring compatibility across Python versions. It detects Python version, assigns input and basestring accordingly, and defines a decorator to handle RuntimeError in generators, likely due to PEP 479. There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no malicious or obfuscated code. The generator wrapper is a known pattern for handling specific runtime errors safely. The import fallback for JSON is standard practice. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and serves a utility purpose without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate. Minor variations in confidence and risk scores are acceptable but could be standardized to zero, reflecting the code's safety.",
