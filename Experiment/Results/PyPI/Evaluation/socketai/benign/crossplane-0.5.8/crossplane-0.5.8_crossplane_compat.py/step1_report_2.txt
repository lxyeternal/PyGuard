{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, handles JSON import fallback, and wraps a generator to handle a specific RuntimeError related to PEP 479.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, functools), optional import of simplejson",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage or system effects",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard for compatibility purposes",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up environment detection for Python 2 and 3, provides compatibility for input functions, and defines a wrapper for generators to handle a known RuntimeError related to PEP 479. All components are standard and do not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code does not include obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as a compatibility layer without any malicious intent or security risks.",
