{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, including a wrapper for handling RuntimeError during generator execution, and a utility to fix PEP 479 issues in Python 3.7.",
  "sources": "Reads system version info from sys.version_info, attempts to import 'simplejson' or falls back to 'json', redefines 'input' and 'basestring' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up compatibility functions and version checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The code correctly handles Python version differences and includes a wrapper for RuntimeError in generators. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script aims for compatibility across Python versions, importing JSON modules conditionally, redefining 'input' and 'basestring' accordingly, and providing a decorator to handle RuntimeError in generators due to PEP 479. All functions serve benign, compatibility-related purposes. No data leaks, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign compatibility code intended to support cross-version Python scripts. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and poses no security risk.",
