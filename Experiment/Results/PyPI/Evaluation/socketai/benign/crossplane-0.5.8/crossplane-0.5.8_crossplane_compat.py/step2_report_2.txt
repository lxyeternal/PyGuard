  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is benign utility functions.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious behavior, no data leaks, no external data processing.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same benign utility functions.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Clear, standard compatibility code with no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Compatibility code with a generator wrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No data leaks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Compatibility functions and a generator wrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard compatibility code, benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to others, utility functions and a generator wrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly above zero.\n- **Justification:** Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) perhaps due to the generator wrapper handling RuntimeError, which could theoretically be exploited if misused, but in context, it’s a benign fix for a known Python issue. The malware score remains 0, as there's no malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, and the code contains no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very close to 0, reflecting benign utility code.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a set of compatibility utilities—nothing malicious, obfuscated, or dangerous. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in report 5 is probably a conservative placeholder for the generator wrapper, but given its benign purpose, it should remain low.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (a very conservative, minimal risk score reflecting the generator wrapper, but acknowledging its benign purpose)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no security risks or malicious intent.",
