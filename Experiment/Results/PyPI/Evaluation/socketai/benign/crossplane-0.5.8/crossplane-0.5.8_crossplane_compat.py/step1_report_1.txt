{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and utility functions for handling JSON and Python version differences, as well as a wrapper to handle PEP 479-related RuntimeErrors in generators.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'sys' module for Python version info, and attempts to import 'simplejson' or falls back to 'json'. It also accesses 'sys.version_info' and the 'generator' parameter in 'fix_pep_479'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into vulnerable operations such as database queries, system commands, or network operations.",
  "flows": "The code reads Python version info, imports modules, and defines a generator wrapper, but there are no external data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard compatibility and utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code detects Python version to assign appropriate 'input' and 'basestring' definitions, imports JSON libraries with fallback, and defines a generator wrapper to handle RuntimeError exceptions that may occur with PEP 479. There is no data leakage, no network operations, no file system access, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. All components serve well-understood, benign purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module aimed at ensuring compatibility across Python versions and handling a specific RuntimeError in generators. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
