  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate. Minor variations in confidence and risk scores are acceptable but could be standardized to zero, reflecting the code's safety."
