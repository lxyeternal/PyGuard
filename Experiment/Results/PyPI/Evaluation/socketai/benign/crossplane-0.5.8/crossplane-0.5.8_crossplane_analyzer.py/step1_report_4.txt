{
  "purpose": "This code defines a parser and validator for nginx configuration directives, managing their context, arguments, and syntax correctness.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration directive statements, including directive names, arguments, and context (e.g., line number, terminating character).",
  "sinks": "Raises exceptions for unknown directives, invalid context, or argument errors; does not perform data output or network actions.",
  "flows": "Input directives are validated against predefined masks and context; errors are raised if validation fails, otherwise the flow completes successfully.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code's logic is straightforward, focused on configuration validation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads directive definitions with associated context and argument masks, then provides functions to validate directives based on context and argument count. It raises specific errors for unknown directives, context violations, and argument mismatches. The register_external_directives function allows dynamic extension of directives. All logic is consistent with standard configuration validation procedures, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate configuration parser and validator for nginx directives, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs validation tasks only and does not include network, file, or data exfiltration operations.",
