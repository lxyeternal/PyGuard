  "purpose": "The code defines a set of constants, data structures, and functions for analyzing nginx configuration directives, including validation of directive usage, context, and arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration directives, arguments, and context tuples for validation. It also imports error classes for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "The code raises custom exceptions for invalid directives or argument usage; it does not write to external systems or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input directives and arguments flow into validation functions, which check context and argument validity. If invalid, exceptions are raised; otherwise, the functions complete successfully.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The 'register_external_directives' function uses 'iteritems()', which may be outdated in Python 3 but is not inherently malicious. No obfuscation, network activity, or system modification appears present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a configuration validation utility for nginx directives, mapping directives to valid contexts and argument patterns. It ensures directives are used correctly within their allowed contexts and with proper arguments, raising specific errors if violations occur. The code is straightforward, using standard Python features and constants for validation logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The only potential concern is the use of 'iteritems()', which may be incompatible with Python 3, but this is a compatibility issue rather than malicious. Overall, the code performs validation and exception handling in a controlled, non-harmful manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration validation tool for nginx directives, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs standard techniques for validation and error handling. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
