{
  "purpose": "The code provides build, test, and setup procedures for the PyObjC framework, managing environment detection, build configuration, and test execution.",
  "sources": "System commands (`sw_vers`, `clang`, `xcrun`), environment variables, plist files, filesystem reads, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "System info commands, file writes (build info), sys.path modifications, module imports.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system commands and environment variables into build info files and environment setup routines; no untrusted input is executed as code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment detection, build configuration, and testing in a standard manner for macOS Python packages. It uses subprocess calls to gather system info, manipulates sys.path for module loading, and writes build metadata. All activities are typical for build scripts and do not indicate malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and test setup script with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The slight security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects reliance on environment info, which could be manipulated if environment is compromised, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
