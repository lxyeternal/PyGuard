  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments with the code, and then synthesize an overall conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script performs environment detection, build customization, and test execution. It calls system utilities (`sw_vers`, `clang`, `xcrun`), reads plist files, manipulates `sys.path` and `sys.modules`, and writes build info files. No malicious activity or backdoors are detected.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (due to reliance on system commands and environment info gathering, which could be exploited if environment is compromised)  \n\n**Assessment:** This is a standard build script with no signs of malicious intent. The low malware score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing environment info gathering via subprocess, environment variables, and file reads. No suspicious code or obfuscation. The code is typical for build scripts.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher, but still low, given the nature of environment info collection)\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity detected; the analysis is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on build setup, environment detection, and test management. Uses subprocess for system info, manipulates environment variables, reads plist files. No malicious behavior or backdoors.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a typical setup script, safe in context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing environment variables, subprocess calls, and file operations for build configuration. No network activity or malicious code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity; standard build setup.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on environment detection, build configuration, and test setup. Uses subprocess to invoke system commands, manipulates `sys.path`, reads SDK info, and configures build flags. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious intent; typical build script behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on **0**. The script's activities are confined to environment detection, build configuration, and testing—nothing indicates malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate **0**. The code is clear, with no obfuscation techniques.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on system commands and environment variables, a very low risk score (~0.1–0.2) is justified. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup and build script for the PyObjC framework.\n- It performs environment detection, build customization, and testing management.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n- The slight security risk score reflects the potential for environment manipulation but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommended Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with environment info gathering)  \n\nThis assessment aligns with all reports and the code's behavior.",
