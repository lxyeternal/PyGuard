{
  "purpose": "Minimal test setup referencing SceneKit's SCNExportJavaScriptModule, likely a placeholder or incomplete test.",
  "sources": "Reference to SceneKit.SCNExportJavaScriptModule without invocation or data input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks; no data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Static reference; no data flow from source to sink as no operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "The line 'SceneKit.SCNExportJavaScriptModule' is unused and not invoked; appears to be a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing modules and SceneKit, defines a test class with a method decorated for a specific OS version, and references a SceneKit attribute without invoking it. There are no malicious operations, data leaks, or dynamic code execution. The reference line is likely a placeholder or an incomplete test. All signals indicate benign, straightforward code with no security threats or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risk. The reference line appears incomplete or a placeholder, but it does not pose any threat. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score of 0.1 due to the placeholder nature.",
