{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a unit test setup for the SceneKit framework, specifically testing JavaScript export functionality on macOS 10.10 or higher.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'PyObjCTools.TestSupport' and 'SceneKit', usage of 'min_os_level' decorator, and access to 'SceneKit.SCNExportJavaScriptModule'.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks indicating data leaks, system modifications, or network activity. No use of untrusted input or sensitive data exposure.",
  "flows": "The code imports testing tools, checks OS level, and accesses a SceneKit module; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "The line 'SceneKit.SCNExportJavaScriptModule' appears to access a module or attribute but does not invoke or modify anything. No suspicious dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing support and SceneKit, defines a test case class with a method that requires macOS 10.10 or higher, and accesses a JavaScript export module within SceneKit. The access is straightforward and consistent with a typical unit test setup. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or system sabotage. The code structure is simple, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test setup for SceneKit's JavaScript module export functionality. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
