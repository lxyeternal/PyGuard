{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the SceneKit framework's SCNAction functionality, verifying constants, protocols, and method signatures, including block parameters and boolean arguments.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'objc', 'PyObjCTools.TestSupport', and 'SceneKit'. Definitions of helper and test classes with method implementations, especially those involving block parameters and constant values.",
  "sinks": "None detected. The code does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, file I/O, or execute commands that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code mainly verifies method signatures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is structured as a standard test suite with no malicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines test classes that verify constants, protocols, and method signatures for SceneKit's SCNAction. It uses standard assertions to confirm constant values and method signatures, including block parameters and boolean flags. No code appears to perform any data processing, external communication, or sensitive operations. All elements follow typical patterns for Objective-C bridging and unit testing in Python. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign test suite for SceneKit's SCNAction API, verifying API signatures and constants. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
