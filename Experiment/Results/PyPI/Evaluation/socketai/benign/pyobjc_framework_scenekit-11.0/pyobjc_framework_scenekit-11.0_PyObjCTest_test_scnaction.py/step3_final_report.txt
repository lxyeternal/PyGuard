{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python unittest suite validating constants, protocols, and method signatures of SceneKit's SCNAction, primarily for SDK binding verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the SceneKit framework constants, method signatures, and protocol definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, external data handling, or untrusted input sources; the code only performs assertions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only verifies static constants and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite that verifies constants, protocols, and method signatures in SceneKit. It uses standard assertion methods to ensure API consistency. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or system modifications. The code's purpose is purely validation of SDK bindings, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for API validation, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the safe and standard nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
