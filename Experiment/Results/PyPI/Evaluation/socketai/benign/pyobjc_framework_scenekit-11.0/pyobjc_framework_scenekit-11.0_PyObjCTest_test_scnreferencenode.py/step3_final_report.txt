{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite for SceneKit's SCNReferenceNode, verifying enum types, constants, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestSupport and SceneKit modules; definitions of test methods accessing class constants and methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network operations, file I/O, or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code checks enum types and constants; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, benign test suite verifying API signatures and constants. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no suspicious constructs. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code's purpose is purely for API validation, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit test for SceneKit APIs, posing no security threat. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
