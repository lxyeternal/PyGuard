{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the SceneKit framework, specifically testing enumeration types, constants, and methods related to SCNReferenceNode.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements for testing tools and the SceneKit framework, and calls to test methods and constants within SceneKit.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that could lead to data leaks, code injection, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, defining test classes and methods, and invoking assertions on framework constants and methods. No untrusted data input or output flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code are present. All code appears to be standard test case definitions and framework API calls.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test class for SceneKit, testing enum types, constants, and method signatures. There are no indications of malicious activity, such as network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. The code uses standard testing assertions and framework functions, with no suspicious code flow or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for the SceneKit framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical validation of framework API features without any suspicious elements.",
