{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for SceneKit's SCNReferenceNode class, verifying enum types, constants, and method behaviors.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools and SceneKit modules, usage of class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only performs assertions and method checks, with no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code performs static assertions and method result checks only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The test code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing tools and SceneKit modules, then defines a test class with methods to verify enum types, constants, and method behaviors at specific OS levels. All actions are standard for unit testing and involve no external data, user input, or network activity. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test suite verifying SceneKit API components. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious intent. The code is safe and standard for testing API functionalities.",
