  "purpose": "Test case for checking the sanity of callable metadata in the SceneKit module",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'PyObjCTools.TestSupport' and 'SceneKit'",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code performs a simple test invocation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing utility and a module, then defines a test case that invokes a method to check callable metadata. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or dynamic code execution. The test appears standard for ensuring module integrity without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for a Python module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
