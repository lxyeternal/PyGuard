  "purpose": "Unit test for the SceneKit module, checking callable metadata sanity",
  "sources": "Import statements: PyObjCTools.TestSupport and SceneKit modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; test method calls a function with no external data input",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing support tools and the SceneKit module, then defines a test case class with a single test method. The test invokes 'assertCallableMetadataIsSane' on SceneKit, which appears to be a standard testing utility for verifying callable objects' integrity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The structure is typical for a unit test and does not involve any network activity, data exfiltration, or dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test for SceneKit, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs a sanity check on the module's callables without involving untrusted input or dangerous operations.",
