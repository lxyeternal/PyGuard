  "purpose": "Unit test for SceneKit module to verify callable metadata sanity",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'PyObjCTools.TestSupport' and 'SceneKit'",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only calls an assertion method on a class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test code with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a test support module and a graphics framework, then defines a test case class with a single test method. The method calls an assertion to check callable metadata of the SceneKit module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code. The code appears to be standard testing boilerplate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It only performs a validation on the SceneKit module's callables, which is typical for testing frameworks.",
