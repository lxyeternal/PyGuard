  "purpose": "Unit testing for SceneKit module to verify callable metadata sanity",
  "sources": "Import statements from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and SceneKit",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; test method calls internal assertions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and the SceneKit module, then defines a test case that verifies metadata integrity. It uses standard import and test assertion without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be straightforward and intended for standard testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test case for verifying SceneKit's callable metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
