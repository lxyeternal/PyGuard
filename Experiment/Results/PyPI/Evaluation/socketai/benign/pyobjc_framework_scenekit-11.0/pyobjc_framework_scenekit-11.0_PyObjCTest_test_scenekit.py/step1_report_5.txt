  "purpose": "Unit test for callable metadata sanity check in the SceneKit module",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from PyObjCTools.TestSupport import TestCase' and 'import SceneKit'",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or data",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; test method performs a static assertion",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and a core library (SceneKit). It defines a test case class with a single test method that asserts the integrity of callable metadata in SceneKit. All operations are static and involve only assertions, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. No signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test for the SceneKit module, with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
