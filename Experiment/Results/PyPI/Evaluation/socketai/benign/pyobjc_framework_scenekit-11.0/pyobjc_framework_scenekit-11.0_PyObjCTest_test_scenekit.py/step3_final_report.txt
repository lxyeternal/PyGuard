  "purpose": "A simple unit test verifying the callable metadata of the SceneKit module.",
  "sources": "Import of TestCase from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and the SceneKit module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The test calls assertCallableMetadataIsSane with SceneKit as input, verifying internal callable metadata integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward static test.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static unit test that imports testing utilities and the SceneKit module, then performs a simple assertion to verify callable metadata. There are no dynamic operations, network activity, or data processing. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
