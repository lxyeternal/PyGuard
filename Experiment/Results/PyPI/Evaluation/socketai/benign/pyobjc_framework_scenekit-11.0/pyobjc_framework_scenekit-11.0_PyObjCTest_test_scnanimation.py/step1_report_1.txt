{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for the SceneKit framework's animation classes and protocols, including helper classes to mock or test behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules objc, SceneKit, and PyObjCTools; defines test classes and methods that invoke framework methods and protocols.",
  "sinks": "Calls to framework methods that set or get animation properties, and assertion methods verifying method signatures and protocol conformance.",
  "flows": "The code tests protocol existence and method signatures; no untrusted data inputs or external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior; test methods follow standard patterns for method and protocol validation. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite verifying the presence and correctness of protocols, method signatures, and properties related to SceneKit animations. It defines a helper class with stub implementations, then uses assertions to verify protocol existence, method signatures (types and BOOL flags), and method behaviors. No external input, no suspicious network activity, no file or system modifications are present. The code solely interacts with framework APIs and performs validation, indicating typical testing behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for SceneKit animation classes and protocols, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It performs standard validation of API signatures and protocol conformance. There are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
