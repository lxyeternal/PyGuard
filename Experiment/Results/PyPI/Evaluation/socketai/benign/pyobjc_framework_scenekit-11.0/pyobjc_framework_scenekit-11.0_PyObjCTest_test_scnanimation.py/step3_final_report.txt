{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a test suite for SceneKit animation classes and protocols, verifying method signatures, protocol conformance, and property attributes to ensure API correctness.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from imported modules, class method parameters, and property definitions within the test classes.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data does not appear to flow into any sink; the code only performs static assertions and method signature checks without processing external input or data.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to static method calls and assertions within the test framework, with no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code consists of straightforward test assertions and stub methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API validation test suite for SceneKit animation classes, with helper classes providing stub implementations. It performs static checks on protocol existence, method signatures, argument types, and property attributes. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are consistent with the benign, purpose-specific nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-built test suite verifying API signatures and protocol conformance for SceneKit animations. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks, and the current scores are appropriate.",
