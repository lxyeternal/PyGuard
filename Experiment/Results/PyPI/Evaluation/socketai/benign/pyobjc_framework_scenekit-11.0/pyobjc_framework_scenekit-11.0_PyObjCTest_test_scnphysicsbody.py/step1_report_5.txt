{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the SceneKit framework's SCNPhysicsBody class, verifying enums, constants, and method behaviors across different OS versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and SceneKit; no user input, external data, or environment variables are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs assertions and method property checks within a testing context.",
  "anomalies": "The code strictly consists of static test assertions and method signatures; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing and system modules, then defines a test class for SceneKit's physics body functionalities. It tests enum types, constants, and method behaviors across OS levels using assertion methods. There are no indications of code injection, malicious logic, or external data handling. The code appears to be standard unit test code designed for validation purposes. No suspicious or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test suite for SceneKit's physics-related classes and methods. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is benign and solely intended for testing framework validation.",
