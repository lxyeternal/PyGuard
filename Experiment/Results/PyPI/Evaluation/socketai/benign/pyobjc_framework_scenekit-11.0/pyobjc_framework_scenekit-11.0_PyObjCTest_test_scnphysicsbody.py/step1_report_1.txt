{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for SceneKit's SCNPhysicsBody API in macOS/iOS environment.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module; calling assert methods and constants from SceneKit.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; code mainly performs assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and SceneKit, then defines a test case class with various test methods. These methods verify enum types, constants, and method behaviors across different OS versions. All operations are confined to testing the API's correctness and do not perform any external data handling, network operations, or file manipulations. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test suite for SceneKit's physics body API, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not pose any threat related to supply chain security or malware.",
