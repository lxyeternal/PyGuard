{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the SceneKit framework's SCNPhysicsBody class, verifying constants, enum types, and method signatures, primarily for unit testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports system modules (sys), testing support modules (PyObjCTools.TestSupport), and the SceneKit framework. No user input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data; it merely asserts properties and method signatures. No data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications occur.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves calling assertion methods to verify properties and method signatures of the SceneKit classes. No untrusted data flows or manipulation are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are observed. The code appears straightforward, focused on testing method signatures and constants.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules and performs static assertions on an Apple framework's classes and constants. It uses standard testing patterns, including OS-level version checks. No external data, user input, or dynamic code execution exists. There are no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code's purpose is strictly to verify API correctness and compatibility across OS versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured unit test suite for the SceneKit framework's physics body class. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is safe and serves solely as a validation tool for the API.",
