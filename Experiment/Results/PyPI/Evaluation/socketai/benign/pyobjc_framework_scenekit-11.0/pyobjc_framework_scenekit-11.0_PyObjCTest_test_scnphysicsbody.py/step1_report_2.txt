  "purpose": "Unit tests for SceneKit's SCNPhysicsBody API, verifying enum types, constants, and method signatures on macOS.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, TestSupport, and SceneKit; class definition; test methods invoking SceneKit API functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process external or untrusted data, nor does it execute any system commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code strictly performs assertions on API constants and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears to be standard unit test code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system modules and testing utilities, then defines a test case class that verifies enum types, constants, and method signatures for SceneKit's physics body component. All interactions are within the scope of API validation and do not involve processing external data or executing potentially malicious commands. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, focusing on unit testing functions and constants, typical for SDK or framework validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for SceneKit's physics body API, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs safe assertions on constants and method signatures, with no data leaks or harmful behaviors.",
