  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code content, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward unit test suite for SceneKit's SCNPhysicsBody API.\n- The code only performs assertions on constants, enum types, and method signatures.\n- No external data, network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected.\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0, which seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is purely testing API constants and method signatures. There are no issues or vulnerabilities present.\n- **Malware potential:** No malicious behavior or intent is evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** No external data handling, no system modifications, no network activity.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Justification:\nGiven the above, the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The logic and reasoning are sound; no assumptions are made beyond the observable code.\n- The OS version-specific tests are standard for API validation and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **No changes needed** in the scores or reasoning.\n- The overall assessment should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, my estimates are:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a benign, standard unit test suite verifying API constants and method signatures, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The scores are justified and should remain as reported.",
