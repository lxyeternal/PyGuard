  "purpose": "Unit tests for SceneKit's SCNPhysicsBody API, verifying enum types, constants, and method signatures across OS versions.",
  "sources": "Static assertions and method calls within the test suite; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform system modifications.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code performs static checks without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward API validation with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite verifying constants, enum types, and method signatures for SceneKit's SCNPhysicsBody. It includes OS version-specific tests but does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The assertions are static and intended solely for API correctness validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and solely for API validation. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
