{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for SceneKit's SCNPhysicsBody class, verifying enum types, constants, and method behaviors across different macOS versions.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, SceneKit modules, and uses TestSupport utilities; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only performs assertions and method calls within a test framework.",
  "flows": "The code calls methods and checks properties of SceneKit objects; no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward test code for API validation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system and SceneKit modules, then defines a test class to verify enum types, constants, and methods of SCNPhysicsBody. It uses version-specific decorators to test different functionalities. All operations involve internal API calls and assertions, with no data input, output, or external communication. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and the code appears to serve as a compatibility and correctness check for the API.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for SceneKit's physics body API, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It performs API validation without external data handling or system modification.",
