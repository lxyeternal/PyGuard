  "purpose": "Unit tests for SceneKit's SCNMaterial constants and methods in Python bindings.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestCase, min_os_level, and SceneKit; test methods accessing SceneKit constants and methods.",
  "sinks": "Assertions checking constants, enum types, and method behaviors; no untrusted data sources or data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Test methods invoke assertions on SceneKit constants and methods, mainly reading predefined constants and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. The code strictly tests SceneKit bindings.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured unit tests on SceneKit Python bindings, verifying enum types, constants, and method signatures. It uses assertion methods to ensure constants are correct and methods return expected boolean values. There are no data inputs from external sources, no network or file operations, and no suspicious code patterns. The code's purpose is to validate the integrity of API bindings, with no malicious intent apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for SceneKit's Python bindings. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The structure is typical for testing constants and method signatures, with no suspicious or harmful code detected.",
