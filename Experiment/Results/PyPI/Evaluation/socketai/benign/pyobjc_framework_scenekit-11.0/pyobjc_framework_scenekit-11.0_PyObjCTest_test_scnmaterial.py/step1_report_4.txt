  "purpose": "Unit tests for SceneKit's SCNMaterial API in the PyObjCTools framework, ensuring correct enum, constant, and method behaviors.",
  "sources": "Import statements for testing modules and SceneKit; attribute references to SceneKit classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network operations, file writes, or external command executions detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely performs assertions and type checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code strictly performs assertions on known constants and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite validating the presence and types of constants, enums, and method behaviors in SceneKit. It employs minimal logic, only assertions to confirm expected values. There are no signs of data handling, input/output operations, or malicious behaviors. The use of version decorators indicates compatibility checks, not malicious code. Overall, the code appears to be a safe, conventional test script without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward test suite for SceneKit's Python bindings, with no malicious code, suspicious patterns, or security risks detected. It functions solely to verify constants, enums, and method signatures, with no indication of malware or security threats.",
