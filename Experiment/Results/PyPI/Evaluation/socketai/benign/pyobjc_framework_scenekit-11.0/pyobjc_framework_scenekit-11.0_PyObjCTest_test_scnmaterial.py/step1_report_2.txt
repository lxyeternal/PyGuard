{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for SceneKit's SCNMaterial API bindings, verifying constants, enums, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport, SceneKit module usage, and assertions on SceneKit constants and methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code primarily performs type assertions and does not process untrusted input or produce output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not handle external input or network data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets observed. The code performs standard testing routines.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite verifying constants, enum types, and method signatures of SceneKit's API. It imports testing support modules and uses assertion methods to confirm the types and values of various constants and methods. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code does not interact with external systems, handle sensitive data, or execute any dynamic code. It appears to be standard test code intended for validating API bindings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, safe test suite for SceneKit bindings with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
