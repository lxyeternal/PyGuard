  "purpose": "Unit tests for the SceneKit framework bindings, verifying enums, constants, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: PyObjCTools.TestSupport, SceneKit",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data outputs; no network or system calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; all functions are test assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for the SceneKit Python bindings, checking enum types, constants, and method properties. It uses assertion methods to verify type and value correctness. The code exclusively calls testing assertions and framework APIs without any data manipulation, network access, or system modifications. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The focus is on ensuring the integrity of the bindings, not on processing external or untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test suite for SceneKit bindings, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The structure and content are consistent with standard testing practices.",
