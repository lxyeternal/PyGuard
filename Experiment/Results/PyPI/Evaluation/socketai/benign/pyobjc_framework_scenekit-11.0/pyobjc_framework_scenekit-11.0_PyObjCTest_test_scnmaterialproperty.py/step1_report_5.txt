{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of unit tests for the SceneKit framework, specifically testing enum types, constants, and method signatures related to SCNMaterialProperty.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are read; the code only references constants and methods defined within the imported modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs assertions on constants and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code strictly tests predefined constants and method argument configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing tools and SceneKit modules, then performs assertions on enum types, constant values, and method argument expectations. It uses standard testing practices without dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling untrusted data. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test suite for SceneKit properties and methods. It does not contain malware or security risks, nor does it process untrusted input or perform suspicious operations.",
