{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the SceneKit framework, specifically testing enum types, constants, and method signatures related to SCNMaterialProperty.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and SceneKit modules; no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions; only assertions on constants and method signatures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted inputs; the code only verifies constants and method argument properties.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code strictly performs unit test assertions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit testing module using assertions to verify enum types, constants, and method argument configurations for the SceneKit framework. No data is read from or written to external sources, nor are there any network, file, or system modifications. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code segments, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is structurally simple, well-formatted, and adheres to standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for verifying API constants and method signatures in SceneKit; it shows no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
