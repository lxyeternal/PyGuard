{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the SceneKit framework, specifically testing enum types, constants, and method signatures related to SCNMaterialProperty.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules (PyObjCTools, SceneKit)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not handle untrusted input or perform data output",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines tests and assertions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing tools and SceneKit modules, then defines a test class with methods to verify enum types, constants, and method signatures with specified OS version constraints. All code appears to be standard unit testing for API validation. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The code strictly performs assertions related to the API's expected behavior and attributes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for SceneKit API attributes and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and primarily used for validation purposes.",
