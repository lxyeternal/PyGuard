  "purpose": "Unit testing for SceneKit's SCNMaterialProperty enum types, constants, and methods with version-specific tests.",
  "sources": "Import statements from PyObjCTools and SceneKit modules, method calls within test cases.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code primarily performs assertions and method configurations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; test functions invoke existing API methods for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing tools and SceneKit, then defines test cases for enum types, constants, and methods with version gating. All assertions validate expected enum values or method argument configurations. There are no indications of data manipulation, network activity, or other malicious actions. The code appears standard for a unit test suite, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard unit testing on SceneKit's API; it does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
