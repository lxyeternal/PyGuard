{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that provides wrappers for the macOS SceneKit framework, enabling Python developers to interface with Objective-C frameworks.",
  "sources": "Reading the script's own file system (os.path, os.listdir), importing modules (sys, pyobjc_setup), and processing dependencies and extension modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection points could be from dynamic extension module compilation, but in this code, no untrusted data is used directly in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The script reads its directory contents to list dependencies, then passes these to the Extension configuration for building C/Objective-C modules, with no untrusted data flowing into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution. The code adheres to standard package setup practices. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: defining package info, collecting source files, configuring extensions, and declaring dependencies. It does not include code that executes external commands, handles user input, or manipulates environment variables beyond standard setup routines. No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or malware features are evident. All operations appear benign and typical for a Python C-extension package build script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package wrapping macOS frameworks. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is standard and appears safe.",
