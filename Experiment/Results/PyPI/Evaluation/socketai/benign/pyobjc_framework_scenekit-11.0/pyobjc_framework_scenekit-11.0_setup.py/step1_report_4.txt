{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup instructions for building and installing the 'pyobjc-framework-SceneKit' package, which provides Python wrappers for the macOS SceneKit framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem (os.listdir), environment (via sys.path modification), and the module's own documentation string (__doc__).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities; no network connections, command executions, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data (Modules/_SceneKit*.m files) flows from os.listdir() into the Extension dependencies; documentation string flows into the setup description. No data flows into or out of untrusted sources that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs typical setup operations with no obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a local setup module, modifies sys.path, and configures package build parameters for a Python extension module wrapping macOS framework components. It uses standard practices for defining extensions and dependencies, with no indications of malicious behavior or malicious code injection. All operations are related to package setup and installation procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python wrapper around the SceneKit framework. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. The code performs standard build configuration without any obfuscated or malicious intent.",
