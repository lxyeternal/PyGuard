  "purpose": "Setup script for building Python bindings for macOS's SceneKit framework using pyobjc.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads of 'Modules' directory to include source files, environment variables, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, no network activity, no data leaks, no code injection or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads module files from 'Modules' directory during extension configuration, links against system framework, and installs package.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns. Standard build process.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python extension module, performing filesystem operations to include source files and configure build parameters. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The reliance on 'Modules' directory is standard in extension building; unless compromised, it does not pose a security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk is associated with external source files, which is typical in such build scripts. All reports' assessments and scores are consistent and accurate.",
