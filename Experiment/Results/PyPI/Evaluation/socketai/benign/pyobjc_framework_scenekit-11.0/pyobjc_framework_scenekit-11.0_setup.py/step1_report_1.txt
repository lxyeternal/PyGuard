{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up Python bindings for the macOS SceneKit framework using pyobjc, enabling Python scripts to interface with macOS graphics and animation features.",
  "sources": "Reading the script file itself, reading contents of the 'Modules' directory to list dependencies, importing standard modules os and sys, importing pyobjc_setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks related to untrusted data or external communication identified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is configuration/setup code, not data processing or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The setup process appears standard for a Python extension package.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package setup parameters, including name, description, dependencies, and compilation details for a Python extension module interfacing with the macOS SceneKit framework. It manipulates sys.path, reads the 'Modules' directory to determine dependencies, and uses setuptools for packaging. No input from external sources or untrusted data is processed; the code strictly configures a build process. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script for a Python wrapper around a system framework. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks. It functions solely as a build configuration for the package.",
