{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configurations for building and installing the pyobjc-framework-SceneKit package, which provides Python bindings for the macOS SceneKit framework.",
  "sources": "Reads module files from the 'Modules' directory, environment variables via sys.path and os.path, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setup' to install extensions and dependencies, which could potentially lead to malicious code execution if the source files or dependencies are compromised.",
  "flows": "Imports from pyobjc_setup to configure build extensions; reads module files from 'Modules' directory; installs dependencies and extensions based on the specified configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs standard setup operations for building a Python extension package.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, modifies sys.path, and sets up package configuration with extensions and dependencies. It constructs file paths dynamically from the 'Modules' directory, which could pose a risk if the directory contents are malicious, but this is standard practice in package setup. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity is present. The code relies on external files ('Modules/_SceneKit.m' and '_SceneKit_inlines.m') for compilation, which are not provided, but their presence alone is typical for such extension modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for building Python bindings for macOS frameworks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious dependencies. The code is benign and typical for such a package configuration.",
