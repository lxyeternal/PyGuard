  "purpose": "This source code defines a UserAgent class used to generate a string representing client environment and version information for the Percy Python client.",
  "sources": "self.config.api_url, self.environment.current_ci, imports (percy, re, platform, django)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or harmful actions. No external commands or data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "self.config.api_url is parsed via regex to extract API version; environment info and versions are assembled into a string.",
  "anomalies": "None of the code performs unusual or suspicious activities. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs a user-agent string with version info. It imports and utilizes standard Python modules and the 'percy' library. The only dynamic data source is 'self.config.api_url', which is parsed using a regex; this is typical. Environment information is gathered from class attributes and imported modules. No suspicious code behaviors, obfuscated patterns, or malicious code segments are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation for generating environment information strings. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
