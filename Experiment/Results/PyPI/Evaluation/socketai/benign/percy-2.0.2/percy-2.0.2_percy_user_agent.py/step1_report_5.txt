  "purpose": "Generate a user agent string with environment and version information for the Percy Python client.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data (api_url), environment information (current_ci), and package version (percy.__version__).",
  "sinks": "The _api_version method extracts data from self.config.api_url, which could be untrusted input; other data outputs are for informational purposes.",
  "flows": "Input from self.config.api_url is processed via regex in _api_version, and environment info is assembled into string outputs. No direct data flow to sensitive sinks like network or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code performs typical environment detection and string formatting without obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a user agent string based on package version, Python, and Django versions if available. It extracts version info from config using regex, which could potentially be misused if self.config.api_url is maliciously crafted. However, the regex is simple and standard. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors detected. The code's purpose is benign, primarily for informational and identification purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing environment detection and string formatting for user agent purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The only minor concern is that the regex on self.config.api_url could be misused if input is untrusted, but it is not inherently malicious.",
