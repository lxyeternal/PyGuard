  "purpose": "Constructs a user-agent string with environment and version info for the Percy Python client.",
  "sources": "self.config.api_url, self.environment.current_ci, imported modules (re, percy, platform, django).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Regex in _api_version() extracts version from api_url; environment info included in string.",
  "anomalies": "Potential None return from re.search in _api_version() if pattern not matched; no validation or exception handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code assembles a user-agent string using version info and environment data. The main operation involves regex on self.config.api_url without validation, which could cause an AttributeError if no match is found. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries. The only concern is robustness against malformed input, not security. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and assign low risk scores (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to the unvalidated regex. The code is benign, with a minor potential for runtime exceptions that can be mitigated with validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily gathering environment info for user-agent string construction. The only technical flaw is the lack of validation in regex matching, which could cause runtime errors if the URL pattern does not match. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.",
