{
  "purpose": "Generate a string representation of a user agent with environment and version info",
  "sources": "Reading configuration data (self.config.api_url), environment attributes (self.environment.current_ci), and package version info (percy.__version__)",
  "sinks": "Returning formatted string; no untrusted data directly used in sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Self.config.api_url -> _api_version() -> re.search -> __str__ method; self.environment.current_ci used in __str__",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex on api_url without validation; reliance on environment attribute current_ci which could be manipulated if not securely set; no obvious malicious code or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a user agent string including Percy library version, Python version, and environment info. It reads configuration data and environment variables, but these are standard practices. The regex used in _api_version() extracts the last word character sequence from api_url, which may potentially be manipulated if api_url is untrusted, but this is typical for such usage. No code injection, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for forming user agent strings with environment info. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The primary concern is ensuring that config.api_url and environment.current_ci are set securely, but this is outside the scope of this code.",
