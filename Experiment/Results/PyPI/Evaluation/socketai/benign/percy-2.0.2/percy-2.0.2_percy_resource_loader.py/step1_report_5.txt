  "purpose": "The code is designed to load resources from a specified directory and a web driver, generating resource URLs and capturing snapshot resources for visual testing.",
  "sources": "File system via os.walk and open() calls; web driver via self.webdriver.current_url and self.webdriver.page_source",
  "sinks": "Construction of resource URLs with string formatting; reading file contents into memory",
  "flows": "File contents are read and hashed, then used to create resource objects with URLs derived from file paths and base URL; Web driver data used to create snapshot resource with URL parsing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code handles file and web driver data securely, with proper URL parsing and filename handling. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, handling compatibility between Python 2 and 3. It defines resource loader classes with methods to gather file-based resources and snapshot data from a web driver. The build_resources method walks the directory, filters large files, reads file contents, generates URLs, and creates resource objects with hashed content. The snapshot_resources method constructs a resource object from the web driver's current URL and page source. There are no signs of malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or insecure data handling. The code relies on external libraries and standard Python modules, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs resource loading and snapshot capturing for testing purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It appears to be a standard, well-structured resource loader with no security risks or malware indicators.",
