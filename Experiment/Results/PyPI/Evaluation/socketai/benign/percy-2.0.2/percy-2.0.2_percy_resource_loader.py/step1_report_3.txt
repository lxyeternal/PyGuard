{
  "purpose": "This code loads web resources from a directory and captures snapshot resources using a WebDriver for testing or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads files from the file system via os.walk and open(), retrieves current URL and page source from webdriver.",
  "sinks": "None directly involving untrusted data manipulation leading to data leaks or harmful actions; resource URLs are constructed from local paths and base URLs.",
  "flows": "File contents are hashed; file paths are converted and concatenated with base_url to form resource URLs; webdriver's current_url and page_source are used for snapshot resources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code constructs URLs and reads files in a standard manner, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file system traversal and reads file contents, generating resource objects with hashes. It also captures snapshot data from a WebDriver instance. There are no suspicious code injections, no external network communication beyond standard URL handling, and no hardcoded secrets. The URL construction is straightforward, and content handling is safe. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard resource loader and snapshot capture utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages local files and web page data in a typical manner.",
