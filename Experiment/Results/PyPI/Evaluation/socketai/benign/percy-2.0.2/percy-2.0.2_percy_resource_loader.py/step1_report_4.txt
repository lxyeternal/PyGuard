{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for loading resources from a directory and a web driver, primarily for use in visual testing or snapshot creation.",
  "sources": "Reads file contents from disk (os.walk, open), reads current URL and page source from webdriver, and URL parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "Constructs resource URLs, hashes file contents, and accesses webdriver properties (current_url, page_source).",
  "flows": "File data flows from disk to hash computation and URL construction; webdriver data flows from current_url and page_source to resource creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Uses standard library and percy SDK functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs resource loading for testing purposes, with proper handling of file sizes and URL formatting. It uses external libraries appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The only potential concern could be if the webdriver's current_url or page_source are manipulated externally, but this is expected behavior for such a testing context and does not indicate malicious intent. No security issues like insecure file handling or code injection are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward resource loader implementation for testing purposes with no malicious or suspicious code. It does not perform any harmful operations or data leaks. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
