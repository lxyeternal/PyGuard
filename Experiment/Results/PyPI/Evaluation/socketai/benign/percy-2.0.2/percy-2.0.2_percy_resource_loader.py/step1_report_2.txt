{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load web resources from a directory or a web driver for use in visual testing with Percy.",
  "sources": "Reads file contents from a specified root directory using os.walk, and reads the current URL and page source from a webdriver object.",
  "sinks": "Reads file content into memory, constructs URLs from file paths, and accesses webdriver properties (current_url and page_source).",
  "flows": "File contents are hashed with utils.sha256hash; file paths are converted to URLs; webdriver's current_url and page_source are used to create resources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code appears standard with typical resource loading logic; no unusual or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically walks through a directory, reads files under size limit, generates URLs, and creates Resource objects. It also creates a resource for the current webpage using a webdriver. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Usage of standard libraries and typical patterns indicates no obfuscation or malware. The code handles URL parsing and path manipulation securely within normal bounds. No unsafe eval, code injection, or suspicious network behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate resource loading for a visual testing tool, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, using standard libraries and practices, and does not exhibit malware or supply chain security issues.",
