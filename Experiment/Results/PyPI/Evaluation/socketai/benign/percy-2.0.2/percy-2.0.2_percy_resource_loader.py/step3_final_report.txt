  "purpose": "Resource loader for files and web driver snapshots used in visual testing or web scraping.",
  "sources": "File system via os.walk, web driver current_url and page_source.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; primarily URL construction and file reading.",
  "flows": "File paths are converted to URLs and hashed; web driver URL and page source are captured.",
  "anomalies": "Minor URL concatenation logic that could be improved; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward resource loader that reads files, filters by size, hashes content, and constructs URLs. It also captures snapshot data from a webdriver. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The URL handling could be more robust, but this does not introduce security issues. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected, and the code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or security flaws. It functions as intended for resource collection in testing environments. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2). Minor URL handling improvements are suggested but do not impact security.",
