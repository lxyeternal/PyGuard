{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load web resources from a directory or web driver for snapshot purposes, likely in a visual testing or web scraping context.",
  "sources": "File system reads via os.walk, os.path.getsize, open(), and reading file content; URL parsing via urlparse; Web driver current URL and page source via webdriver object.",
  "sinks": "Resource URL construction using base URL and pathname, reading file contents into memory, and accessing webdriver properties.",
  "flows": "File content is read and hashed; file paths are converted to URLs; web driver URL and page source are accessed; resources are created with this data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads files from a specified directory, skipping large files, and converts file paths into URL-like resource URLs for further processing. It also interacts with a web driver to obtain the current URL and page source. Usage of standard libraries and known open-source packages (percy, urllib, os) is appropriate. No external or untrusted data sources appear to be exploited maliciously. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose related to resource collection for visual testing.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It performs file and web driver data collection in a manner consistent with its purpose. No malware, suspicious anomalies, or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
