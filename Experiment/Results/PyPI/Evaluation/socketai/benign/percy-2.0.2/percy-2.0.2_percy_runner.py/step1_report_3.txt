{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python class for managing visual testing builds and snapshots with Percy, a visual testing platform, including environment setup, resource uploading, and build finalization.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PERCY_ENABLE', loader build resources, resource content (file reading), environment variables (access_token).",
  "sinks": "Uploading resources via self.client.upload_resource, creating builds and snapshots via self.client methods, printing errors.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PERCY_ENABLE' influences whether core functions execute. Resource content from local files is read and uploaded. Build and snapshot data are created and finalized via client API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present. Usage of environment variables for configuration is typical. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns observed. The code's behavior appears consistent with standard Percy SDK usage.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Percy build, uploads resources, manages snapshots, and finalizes builds. Environment variables are used for enabling/disabling features, and exceptions are properly handled. Resource content is read from local files securely. There are no suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code does not perform any network communication outside of client API calls, which are standard for Percy integrations. No signs of code injection, data theft, or malicious intent are detected. The code structure is standard, with no obfuscated or hidden code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Percy SDK implementation for managing visual test builds and snapshots. It performs no malicious actions, does not contain backdoors or hidden data exfiltration, and follows expected security practices. No immediate security risks are identified.",
