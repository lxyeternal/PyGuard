  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, considering the code, the scoring, and potential security implications.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Code or Backdoors:**  \nAll reports consistently indicate that the code is a standard implementation for interacting with Percy’s API, managing builds, snapshots, and resources. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors are identified. The code relies on environment variables for configuration, which is typical in CI/CD environments.\n\n**2. Use of Environment Variables and File I/O:**  \nThe code uses `PERCY_ENABLE` to toggle features and reads resource files from disk if specified. These are standard practices and do not inherently pose security risks. The reports note no malicious data exfiltration or suspicious network activity.\n\n**3. API Interactions and External Libraries:**  \nAll API calls are to the Percy service, which is expected. No signs of malicious API endpoints or unusual behavior are detected. The external libraries used (`percy`, `os`, `errors`, `utils`) are standard and well-understood.\n\n**4. Error Handling and Security Practices:**  \nProper exception handling is in place for authentication errors and uninitialized builds. No evidence of insecure practices such as unsafe deserialization, code injection, or insecure data handling.\n\n**5. Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**  \nAll reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, aligning with the analysis that the code is benign.\n\n**6. Security Risk Scores:**  \nThe reported security risks are low (0.1 to 0.2), which seems reasonable given the code’s function and the lack of malicious activity.\n\n**7. Potential False Positives or Assumptions:**  \nSome reports mention reading files directly from disk without sanitization. While this could be a concern in a different context, here it appears to be standard resource upload behavior for Percy.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** No  \n- **Obfuscation:** No  \n- **Malware Risk:** No evidence found, score remains 0  \n- **Security Risk:** Very low, consistent with reports (0.1–0.2)  \n- **Overall Confidence:** High (around 0.9) that the code is benign and standard for Percy integration.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a typical Percy SDK client wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal inherent risk, mostly due to resource file handling which is standard)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain security incident appears to be a false alarm or a non-issue. The code is safe, well-structured, and performs expected operations without malicious behavior.",
