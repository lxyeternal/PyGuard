{
  "purpose": "This code manages the interaction with Percy for visual testing, including build initialization, snapshot creation, and finalization.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PERCY_ENABLE), external libraries (percy, os), and resource files loaded via resource.local_path.",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variables, reading local resource files, and calling external Percy API methods for creating and finalizing builds and snapshots.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PERCY_ENABLE' controls whether features are enabled. Resource content is read from files or in-memory data, then uploaded via external API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Use of environment variables for enabling features is typical. External API usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages interactions with the Percy API for visual testing, including loading resources, creating builds, snapshots, and finalizing. It uses environment variables for configuration, and reads files from disk if specified. All operations seem aligned with expected behavior for a testing framework. No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. External library usage is normal for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Percy client wrapper for visual testing, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity detected. It operates within expected bounds of a testing utility.",
