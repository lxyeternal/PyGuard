  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to verify the claims, assess the reasoning, and ensure the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard Percy SDK wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code primarily performs environment-based configuration, file I/O for resource uploading, and API interactions with Percy.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.\n- Environment variables are used for configuration, which is common in CI/CD contexts.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Claim:** No suspicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no malicious patterns. The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. The security risk is low, considering the use of environment variables and file I/O, which are standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Claim:** Standard build and snapshot management, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning is consistent. The code handles resource uploads and API calls without suspicious patterns. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Claim:** Standard Percy SDK usage, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis correctly identifies no malicious patterns. The code's use of environment variables, resource reading, and API calls are typical. Malware score is correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Claim:** No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is valid. The code's operations are standard for such integrations. Malware score is appropriately 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Claim:** Legitimate Percy integration, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. No suspicious patterns are evident, and the malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0.1–0.2, reflecting the potential risks associated with reading local files and environment variable reliance, but these are standard practices in CI/CD environments.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided scores.** The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented Percy SDK wrapper with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)  \n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The small security risk score accounts for potential issues with file I/O and environment variables but is appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Work through complete.**",
