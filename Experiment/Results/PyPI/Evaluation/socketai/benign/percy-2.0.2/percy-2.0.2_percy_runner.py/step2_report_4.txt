  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code to identify any discrepancies, potential risks, or overlooked issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the Code:**\n- Manages Percy visual testing lifecycle: build creation, resource uploading, snapshot creation, and build finalization.\n- Uses environment variable `PERCY_ENABLE` to toggle functionality.\n- Reads resource files from disk if `local_path` is provided.\n- Interacts with external Percy API via the `client` object.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- Error handling is in place for missing builds and authentication errors.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code, no suspicious behavior, standard API usage.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard usage, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard Percy SDK usage, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard integration, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, legitimate Percy integration.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware or malicious activity?**  \n  All reports agree that there is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs expected operations for a Percy client wrapper.\n\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns?**  \n  No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or risky behaviors?**  \n  The only minor concern is reading resource files directly from disk without validation, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Use of environment variables and API calls?**  \n  All reports note typical usage.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes, all reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Remains at **0**. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher at **0.2**, reflecting standard operational risks but no significant security concern.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions.** The code is a standard implementation for Percy integration, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| 0         | 0            | 0.2    |\n\n**This assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.**",
