  "purpose": "Utility functions for hashing and encoding data with compatibility considerations for Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'content' parameter in sha256hash() and base64encode() functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions process the input data for hashing and encoding; no external data sinks are present. The print_error() function writes to stderr.",
  "flows": "Input 'content' is checked for unicode, then encoded and passed to hashing or encoding functions, with no external or untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Code appears to be standard utility functions with compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for hashing and encoding, handling unicode in a cross-version manner. The functions do not perform any network, file, or system modifications. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations are present. The print_error() function writes to standard error, which is common for error reporting. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. Overall, the code appears to serve a benign purpose with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides standard utility functions for hashing and encoding, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical in Python projects.",
