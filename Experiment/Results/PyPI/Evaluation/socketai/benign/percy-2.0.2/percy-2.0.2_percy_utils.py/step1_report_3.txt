  "purpose": "Utility functions for hashing, encoding, and error printing, with compatibility handling for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; functions operate on input parameters provided at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Hashing and encoding functions process provided input data; no output to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into sha256hash and base64encode functions, then outputs are returned after processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code is straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple utility functions for hashing and encoding, with version compatibility checks. It imports standard libraries and contains no network, file, or system modifications. The functions are typical and do not exhibit malicious or obfuscated behavior. The comments indicate a consideration for future library use but do not introduce any malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to serve basic data processing purposes without any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard hashing and encoding tasks with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
