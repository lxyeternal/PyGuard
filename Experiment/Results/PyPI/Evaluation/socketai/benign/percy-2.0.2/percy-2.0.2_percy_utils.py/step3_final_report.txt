  "purpose": "Utility functions for error printing, SHA-256 hashing, Base64 encoding, and Unicode detection, intended for cross-version Python compatibility.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to functions such as 'content' in sha256hash and base64encode, and error messages to sys.stderr.",
  "sinks": "None; functions operate solely on provided inputs without external data flows or outputs affecting system security.",
  "flows": "Input 'content' flows through hashing or encoding functions; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard practices and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises simple utility functions that perform hashing, encoding, and error printing. It includes a version check for compatibility, which is standard. No external data sources, network activity, or file I/O are present. The functions do not handle secrets, nor do they contain obfuscation or malicious code. The code's benign nature is consistent across all reports, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, with only a very cautious note in one report. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
