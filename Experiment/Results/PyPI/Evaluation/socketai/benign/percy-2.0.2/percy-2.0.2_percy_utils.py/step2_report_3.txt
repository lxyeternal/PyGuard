  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- **Verification:** The code consists solely of utility functions: error printing, SHA-256 hashing, Base64 encoding, and a Unicode check. No external data sources, sinks, or data flows to external systems are present. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's content.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. — **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds the code benign and straightforward.  \n- **Verification:** Same functions, no external interactions, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the functions are standard, with compatibility handling, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Verification:** No network, file, or malicious code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above; benign utility functions.  \n- **Verification:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, with a confidence of 0.9 and a security risk of 0.1, citing the use of sys.version_info and standard utility functions.  \n- **Verification:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code. The only minor concern could be the environment check, but it's standard practice for compatibility.  \n- **Justification for scores:** Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, the malware score should remain 0. The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation. The security risk is minimal; perhaps a small buffer to 0.1 due to the environment check, but it's standard and not malicious.  \n- **Conclusion:** Overly cautious but not unreasonable, though the security risk score could be set to 0 for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate; the 0.1 in report 5 is overly cautious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is standard utility functions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this with zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
