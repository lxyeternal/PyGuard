  "sources": "sys.version_info, content parameter in sha256hash, base64encode, and _is_unicode functions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present. The functions perform hashing and encoding; no data outputs to network or file.",
  "flows": "Input data (content) flows through hashing or encoding functions; no external or untrusted sources are directly involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for Python version check, which is standard; no signs of obfuscation or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic hashing and encoding utilities, with environment detection for string types. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no external data inputs or outputs are evident. The print_error function writes to stderr, which is typical for error handling. The code appears to be benign utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains standard utility functions for hashing and encoding with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. No anomalies or suspicious activity are present.",
