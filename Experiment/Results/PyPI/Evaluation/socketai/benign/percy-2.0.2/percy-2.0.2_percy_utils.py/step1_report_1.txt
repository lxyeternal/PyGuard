  "purpose": "Utility functions for printing errors, hashing content with SHA-256, and encoding content with Base64.",
  "sources": "No explicit external data sources; functions operate on provided arguments within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; functions return processed data but do not output or transmit untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Input content flows through hash and encode functions, but there are no data flows to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic utility functions for hashing and encoding with standard libraries. It includes a Unicode check helper, compatible with Python 2 and 3, which is a common pattern. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic execution, network communication, or file manipulation. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious intent. The code appears to be standard utility code with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as utility functions for hashing and encoding. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident.",
