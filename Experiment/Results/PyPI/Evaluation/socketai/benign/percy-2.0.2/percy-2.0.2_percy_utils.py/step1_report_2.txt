  "purpose": "Utility functions for hashing and encoding data, along with a custom error printing function.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided as function arguments, particularly 'content' in sha256hash and base64encode functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions output hashed or encoded strings; no untrusted data is sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through encoding or hashing functions, resulting in output strings; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. The comment about possibly using 'six' hints at compatibility considerations but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple hashing and encoding utilities with environment compatibility handling. It does not perform any network activity, file modifications, or external data transmission. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are present. The functions are typical utility implementations with standard Python practices. No anomalies or signs of sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for hashing and encoding data with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
