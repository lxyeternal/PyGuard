  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from a base `Error` class, which itself inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - There are no data sources, sinks, or data flows—just class definitions.\n   - No dynamic code, input/output operations, or data processing is present.\n   - The code appears to be standard, straightforward, and minimal.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Security Risks**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n   - The code does not perform any operations beyond class declaration.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign and intended solely for error handling.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis: the code is simple, standard, and has no security concerns.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations**:\n   - The only point to consider is the `malware` score. Since there's no malicious intent or behavior, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The `securityRisk` score of 0 is justified given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent.\n   - The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes. No changes to the scores are necessary. All evidence points to a safe, non-malicious snippet with no security concerns.",
