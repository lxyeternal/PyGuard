  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code defines a base exception class `Error` and four subclasses: `AuthError`, `RepoNotFoundError`, and `UninitializedBuildError`. All are straightforward class definitions inheriting from `Error`, which itself inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`. There are no data flows, no input/output operations, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no embedded secrets or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is purely structural; it contains only class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are present.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that this code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough. They correctly state that there are no data flows, no external inputs, and no malicious intent.\n- They assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- They assign a security risk score of 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n**No issues with the logical reasoning or summaries.**\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\nThese are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**However, considering the overall context:**\n- The code is trivial and safe.\n- The malware score should be 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk is indeed zero.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The scores given are appropriate and should not be changed.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The code is standard and benign.\n\n**Therefore, the risk score should remain at 0.**\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a simple, standard set of custom exception classes with no security concerns. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
