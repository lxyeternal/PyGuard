  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in Python.",
  "sources": "Class definitions of Error, AuthError, RepoNotFoundError, UninitializedBuildError",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external data handling",
  "flows": "None; static class definitions without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance with no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base Error class, which itself inherits from Python's built-in Exception. There are no data sources, sinks, dynamic behaviors, or external interactions. The code is minimal, standard, and free of obfuscation or secrets. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the analysis. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are present. The code is purely structural, serving as a typical pattern for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
