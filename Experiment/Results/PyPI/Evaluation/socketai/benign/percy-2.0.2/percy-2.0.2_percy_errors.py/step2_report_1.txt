  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code snippet only defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base `Error` class, which itself inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data flows, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n   - The code appears to be standard practice for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and free of security issues.\n   - They mention no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws are identified or implied.\n   - The assessments are consistent and accurate given the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores seem reasonable based on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, indicating no security concern.\n   - This is appropriate because the code is purely structural, with no malicious or risky behavior.\n   - No justification for higher scores is needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0.\n   - This aligns with the code's nature; no malicious activity is observed.\n   - No issues here.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The conclusions are supported by the code's simplicity.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code analysis.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is a standard, harmless pattern for defining exceptions, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, and the reports correctly identify it as such. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustments.",
