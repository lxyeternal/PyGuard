  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from a base Error class, which itself inherits from Python's built-in Exception. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \nNo issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns are observed in the code snippets. All reports agree that the code is purely structural and standard.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly state that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n- **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:  \nSince the code is purely class definitions with no external interactions, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0. Any higher score would imply potential malicious intent or security issues, which are not present here.\n\n6. **Potential Assumptions or Claims**:  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is standard and safe.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \nScores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity observed)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code snippet, there's no reason to assign any risk or malware scores above zero. The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard set of custom exception class definitions with no security concerns. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
