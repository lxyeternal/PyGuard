  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base Error class. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no output mechanisms. The code is straightforward and standard for exception class definitions. No malicious behavior or security risks are observable within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security concerns.",
