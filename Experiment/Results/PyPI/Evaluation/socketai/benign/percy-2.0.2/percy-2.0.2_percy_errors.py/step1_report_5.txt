  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; solely class definitions",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; purely class declarations",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow present in the code",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from the base Exception class. No data processing, no external input/output, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs are present. It appears to serve as a structured way to handle specific error cases within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, standard Python exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
