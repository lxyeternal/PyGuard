  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code only defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base `Error` class, which itself inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present.\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The scores assigned for malware (`0`) and security risk (`0`) are appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also `0`, which is reasonable.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are `0`, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The confidence levels are `1`, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No evidence suggests any risk that would warrant a higher score.\n   - The code is purely structural and does not execute any logic or handle data.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at `0`.\n\n5. **Potential Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's structure.\n   - They correctly conclude no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, there's no need to escalate the risk or malware scores.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**In conclusion, the original code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.**",
