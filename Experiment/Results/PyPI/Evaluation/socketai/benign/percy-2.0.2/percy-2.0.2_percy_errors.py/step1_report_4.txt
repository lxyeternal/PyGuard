{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python project",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines class structures without input or data reading",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are simple exception subclasses with no methods or data manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from the built-in Exception class. These classes are empty and serve as identifiers for specific error conditions. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external data sources, and no outputs or side effects. The code follows standard Python class definition patterns and does not contain any obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, intended for exception handling. It contains no malicious behavior, no malware, and no security risks. It is a benign, standard practice for defining custom exceptions.",
