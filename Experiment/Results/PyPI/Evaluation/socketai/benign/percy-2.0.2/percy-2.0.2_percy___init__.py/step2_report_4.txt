  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the corresponding code snippet to assess the presence of issues, the validity of the scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code snippets are primarily import statements and metadata definitions.\n- No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is visible.\n- Multiple reports mention the use of wildcard imports (`from percy.* import *`), which can be risky if malicious code exists within the imported modules.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are explicitly identified.\n- The confidence levels are generally high, and the malware scores are zero, indicating no apparent malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Reported concern:** Use of wildcard imports potentially hiding malicious code.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Wildcard imports are indeed discouraged as they can obscure the source of imported functions or variables, but in package initialization files, this is somewhat common.\n- No evidence of malicious code or behavior is present.\n- The confidence level (0.7) is reasonable, and the malware score (0) aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed. The risk score is appropriately low, given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2 Analysis**\n\n- **Reported concern:** Import statements and metadata, no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- The confidence (1) is justified, and the scores reflect the absence of issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3 Analysis**\n\n- **Reported concern:** Metadata and imports, no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity is evident.\n- The confidence is high, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4 Analysis**\n\n- **Reported concern:** Multiple wildcard imports, potential masking of malicious code.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The use of wildcard imports is noted, but without evidence of malicious code, this is a style concern rather than a security issue.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk score (0.1) is modest and acceptable, considering the potential for obscured malicious code but no evidence here.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No adjustment necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 5 Analysis**\n\n- **Reported concern:** Standard package setup, wildcard imports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The slightly higher security risk score accounts for the wildcard imports, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified and do not require changes.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No actual malicious code or vulnerabilities are evident in these snippets.\n- **Use of wildcard imports:** Not ideal but common in package `__init__.py` files; does not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n- **Malware scores:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated due to coding style (wildcard imports), but within reasonable bounds.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** for all snippets.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Remains at **0**, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Could be marginally increased if desired, but current scores are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n**Estimated overall scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with current reports)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign with no malicious activity. The primary concern—wildcard imports—is a style and maintainability issue rather than a security threat. No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided code snippets and analysis.",
