  "purpose": "Module initialization and metadata definition for the Percy package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from percy.* modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static imports and metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (`from percy.* import *`), which can obscure imported symbols but are common in package __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variables and import statements from the 'percy' package. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The wildcard imports are a style concern but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, indicating no malicious behavior. The risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the minor concern about wildcard imports but overall benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization file with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of wildcard imports is a stylistic concern but not malicious. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is very low. No further action is necessary.",
