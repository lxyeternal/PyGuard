{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to define metadata about the package and imports various modules from the 'percy' library, likely related to a testing or resource management tool.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__), import statements from 'percy' modules",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or data leaks are evident",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; code mainly sets metadata and imports modules",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or suspicious activities are present; imports are from a known package",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of metadata declarations and module imports, which are standard. No input handling, output, or execution of potentially malicious code is visible. The import statements could suggest reliance on external modules, but without additional context or code execution, no malicious behavior is detected. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a module initializer or metadata definition with standard imports. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
