  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippet with the claims, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations from the code snippet:**\n\n- The code only defines author metadata variables and imports several modules from the 'percy' package using `from percy.* import *`.\n- There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded credentials, external data, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The use of wildcard imports (`from percy.* import *`) can obscure which names are imported, which is a minor concern but common in package `__init__.py` files.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Purpose:** Setup module metadata and import components.\n\n**Analysis & Verdict:**  \nThe report correctly states that this is a benign setup segment with no malicious activity. The concern about wildcard imports is noted but not necessarily malicious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to wildcard import concern)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAccurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Purpose:** Module initialization, importing components.\n\n**Analysis & Verdict:**  \nSame as above, no malicious activity, just import statements and metadata. The confidence is high, and no anomalies are present.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (no apparent risk)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAccurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Purpose:** Metadata and imports from 'percy'.\n\n**Analysis & Verdict:**  \nAgain, this is a benign setup code snippet. No suspicious activity, no external data, no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAccurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Purpose:** Setup for Percy client, multiple imports.\n\n**Analysis & Verdict:**  \nThe report correctly notes the use of wildcard imports, which can be a concern in some contexts but are common in package `__init__.py` files. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (a minor concern due to wildcard imports)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nReasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Purpose:** Initialization or import section.\n\n**Analysis & Verdict:**  \nSame as above, no malicious activity, just imports and metadata. The use of wildcard imports is noted but not suspicious here.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (minor concern about wildcard imports)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAccurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; all are 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all 0.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to wildcard imports, but overall very low, which is appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to the wildcard imports, which are common but can hide malicious code in other contexts)\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code snippet. The risk scores are slightly conservative but reasonable given the wildcard imports, which are typical in package initialization files.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No malicious activity detected.  \n- Wildcard imports are a minor concern but not malicious.  \n- Overall, the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain low scores for malware and obfuscated, with a very low risk score.
