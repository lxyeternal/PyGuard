{
  "purpose": "Defines a Resource class for handling resource URLs, their content, SHA256 hashing, and serialization.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the parameters resource_url, sha, content, local_path, mimetype, and is_root during Resource object initialization.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks identified; no untrusted data is used in dangerous operations or external calls.",
  "flows": "Resource initialization uses input parameters; sha is computed from content if not provided, but no data flows from untrusted sources to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code enforces specific logic for sha and content parameters, which could potentially be manipulated if content is supplied from untrusted sources, but no direct malicious behavior is evident. Use of utils.sha256hash suggests reliance on external library; no suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Resource class with input validation on initialization, ensuring either sha or content is provided, or raising errors. The sha value is computed via utils.sha256hash if not explicitly provided. No external network calls, system commands, or insecure handling of data are present. The module import of 'percy.utils' indicates usage of a helper function for hashing, with no indication of malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Overall, the logic appears safe and intended for resource management within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a resource handler with input validation and hashing. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. The code appears legitimate and does not contain malware indicators.",
