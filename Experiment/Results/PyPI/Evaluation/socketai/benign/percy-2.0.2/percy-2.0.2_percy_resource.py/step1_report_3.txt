  "purpose": "Define a Resource class for managing resource URLs, content, and associated metadata, with hashing functionality.",
  "sources": "The resource_url and kwargs input parameters, especially 'content' and 'sha'.",
  "sinks": "None directly, but potential for hash calculation and data handling functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (resource_url, content, sha) -> object attributes, including sha calculation from content.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional validation logic for 'sha' and 'content'; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. utils.sha256hash usage depends on external utils module.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that manages resources with optional content and hashing. It performs validation to ensure either 'sha' or 'content' is provided. The sha is computed via an external utility if only 'content' is given. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The utils.sha256hash function could potentially be scrutinized if it contains malicious logic, but it is assumed to be a standard hash function. No dangerous data flows or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward resource handler with validation and hashing logic. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It relies on external utility functions for hashing, which should be trusted or reviewed separately.",
