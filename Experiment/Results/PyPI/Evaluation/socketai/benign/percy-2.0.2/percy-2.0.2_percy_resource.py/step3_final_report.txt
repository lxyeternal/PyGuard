  "purpose": "Manage resource URLs, content, and metadata with validation and hashing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'sha', 'content', 'local_path', and 'resource_url'.",
  "sinks": "Hash computation via utils.sha256hash; validation logic enforces correct input usage.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation checks -> optional hash computation -> object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Complex validation conditions; reliance on external utils.sha256hash assumed benign; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Resource class with validation to ensure either 'sha' or 'content' is provided, computing 'sha' if needed. No malicious code, data leaks, or network activity are present. Validation logic is somewhat convoluted but benign. External utility is assumed safe. No obfuscation or backdoors detected. The code is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign resource management class with proper validation and hashing. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
