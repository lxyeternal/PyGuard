The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate but could be slightly lowered to 0.1 for a more conservative estimate. The obfuscation score is 0, consistent with the code's clarity. Overall, the code is well-structured and safe, with scores justified by the analysis."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, with only a very cautious note in one report. Overall, the code poses no security threat."

The only technical flaw is the lack of validation in regex matching, which could cause runtime errors if the URL pattern does not match. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present."
