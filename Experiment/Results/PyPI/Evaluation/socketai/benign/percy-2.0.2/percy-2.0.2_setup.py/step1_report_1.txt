{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python client library called 'percy'.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies ('requirements', 'test_requirements'), metadata fields (name, version, description, author, url, classifiers, etc.), and package directory information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions are found.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The setup process reads static data and configuration, then passes it to setuptools without transformations or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures. The script appears to be a standard setup.py configuration for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that imports 'setuptools', defines requirements and test requirements lists, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, or external data interactions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The script strictly performs package configuration tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py configuration script used for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is safe and intended solely for distributing the 'percy' client library.",
