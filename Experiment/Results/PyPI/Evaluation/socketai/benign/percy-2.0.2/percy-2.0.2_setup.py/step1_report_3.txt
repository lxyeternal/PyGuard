{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'percy' Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function such as package names, URLs, author info, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data flows from external sources; all data appears static and controlled.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or untrusted data flows; configuration data is hardcoded and fixed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated segments, or hidden behaviors observed. The code strictly follows standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines package requirements, metadata, and configuration options. All data is hardcoded and static, with no dynamic execution, input reading, or untrusted data handling. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner.",
