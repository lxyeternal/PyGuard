  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging and distributing the 'percy' Python client library.",
  "sources": "The script reads package metadata and dependencies, such as 'requirements' and 'test_requirements'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data is used or where untrusted data could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining dependencies to configuring the package setup with static metadata; no dynamic or external input flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are observed. The script uses standard setuptools setup conventions with no hidden or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "This script is a straightforward package setup using setuptools. It specifies package info, dependencies, and metadata without any code execution beyond static configuration. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The dependencies are standard and explicitly declared. There are no hardcoded secrets or potential backdoors. The structure and content are typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply prepares the package for distribution with defined dependencies and metadata.",
