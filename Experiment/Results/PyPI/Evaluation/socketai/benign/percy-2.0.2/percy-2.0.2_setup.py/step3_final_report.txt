{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library named 'percy'. It defines dependencies and metadata statically, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() call, including requirements, package info, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only configures package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup script with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or obfuscation. It performs package configuration only, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with the exception of report 5's slightly elevated risk score, which is unjustified given the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. All assessments should assign malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0 for consistency and accuracy.",
