  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'percy' Python client library for visual regression testing.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies from 'requirements' and 'test_requirements'; reading package metadata from variables and setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into security-sensitive operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Loading requirements and test requirements, then executing setup() to package the library.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present; usage of well-known setup tools and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script utilizing setuptools for packaging. It defines dependencies and package metadata without any dynamic or untrusted data inputs, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The dependencies are straightforward and publicly known, with no signs of malicious payloads or malicious code injection. No source-to-sink data flow indicates any malicious activity or security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It uses standard practices for package configuration without any suspicious elements.",
