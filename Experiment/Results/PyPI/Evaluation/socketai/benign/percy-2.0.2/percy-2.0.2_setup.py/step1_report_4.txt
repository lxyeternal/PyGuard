  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'percy' Python client library, specifying dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded variables for package requirements, test requirements, and package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded requirements and metadata variables into the setup() function to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code behavior are present. The code appears to be standard packaging script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines dependencies for the package. It sets up package metadata including name, version, description, author, URL, and classifiers. The code appears to be straightforward, typical for a Python package setup. No external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data processing are involved. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute any untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
