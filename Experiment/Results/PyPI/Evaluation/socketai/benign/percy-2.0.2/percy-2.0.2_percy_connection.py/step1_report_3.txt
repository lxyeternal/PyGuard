{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for making HTTP requests with retry logic, including authorization and user-agent headers, primarily for API communication.",
  "sources": "Config object (access_token), UserAgent class output, function parameters (path, data), environment variables indirectly via config",
  "sinks": "HTTP request responses, response content, print_error function calls for logging errors",
  "flows": "Config access_token and environment data -> _token_header() -> request headers -> HTTP requests -> response handling and error reporting",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or secrets; the code follows standard request handling patterns; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a session with retries, constructs authorization headers using a token from config, and performs GET and POST requests with error handling. No malicious behavior or data leaks are evident. The use of utils.print_error suggests logging of errors but no data exfiltration or backdoors. The code does not connect to suspicious domains or execute malicious payloads. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, well-structured HTTP request wrapper with retry logic and error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate API client implementation.",
