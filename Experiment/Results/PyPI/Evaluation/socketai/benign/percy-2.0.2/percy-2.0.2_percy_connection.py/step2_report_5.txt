  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scoring, and the reasoning provided.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard API client wrapper with retry logic, token-based authorization, and error handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected.\n- The code uses external libraries (`requests`, `percy`) in a typical manner.\n- No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The access token is sourced from configuration, assuming secure management outside this code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports do not identify any issues that are actually present in the code. They all conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws, security issues, or mistakes are identified in any report.\n- The reasoning appears sound, emphasizing the benign nature of the code and standard practices.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** all reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** all reports assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** all assign 0.2, which seems slightly high for such straightforward code but might be a default or conservative estimate considering potential misuse of untrusted input or token handling.\n\n### Risk scoring justification:\n- Since the code does not perform any malicious activity, and the only sensitive data involved is the access token (which is assumed to be managed securely outside), a **risk score of 0.2** is reasonable, though perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The only potential concern is that the `path` parameter is directly used in network requests. However, this is standard for request functions, and proper validation should be handled elsewhere if needed.\n- No code injection, command execution, or backdoors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n**Should remain at 0**, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n**Should remain at 0**, no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n**Could be slightly lowered to 0.1** to reflect the benign nature, but 0.2 is acceptable if conservative.\n\n**Overall scores:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.1–0.2** (current 0.2 is acceptable)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured API client wrapper.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are detected.\n- The scores given are reasonable, but slightly lowering the risk score could better reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0. Adjust the security risk score slightly downward if desired, but current scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the `access_token` is securely stored and managed outside the code. Proper validation of input parameters like `path` should be enforced elsewhere to prevent misuse, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.",
