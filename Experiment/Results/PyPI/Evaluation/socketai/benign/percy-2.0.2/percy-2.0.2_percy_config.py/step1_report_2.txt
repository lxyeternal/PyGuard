{
  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for Percy API integration, managing API URL, default widths, and access token with environment variable support.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PERCY_API' and 'PERCY_TOKEN'; class constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "Access token retrieval in 'access_token' property; no other clear data sinks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> internal attributes -> 'access_token' property access; no external data flows or untrusted input handling beyond environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or malicious code behavior; standard use of environment variables and property setters/getters.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration class with environment variable fallback for sensitive data (API token). It raises an error if 'access_token' is accessed without being set, which is a typical pattern. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity. Use of environment variables is standard practice. The code appears benign and intended for configuration management only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal configuration class without malicious intent or security risks. It securely manages credentials via environment variables and provides standard getter/setter methods. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
