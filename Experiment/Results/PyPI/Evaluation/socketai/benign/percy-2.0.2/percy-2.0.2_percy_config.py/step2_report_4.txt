  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code defines a straightforward configuration class managing API URL, default widths, and access token.\n   - The code uses environment variables ('PERCY_API' and 'PERCY_TOKEN') during initialization, with accessors to retrieve or set these values.\n   - The `access_token` property raises an error if the token is not set, which is a common pattern for credential validation.\n\n2. **Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - None of the reports detect any malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n   - No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, cryptojacking, or other malware behaviors.\n   - Use of environment variables for sensitive data is standard practice and does not suggest malicious intent.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Issues:**\n   - The logic appears sound; raising an error when the access token is missing is appropriate.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present.\n   - The code is simple, clear, and aligns with best practices for configuration management.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), justified by the fact that the code handles sensitive data but does so securely.\n   - Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies & Recommendations:**\n   - The only minor point is that the reports rate the security risk as slightly above zero (up to 0.2). Given the code's benign nature, this is reasonable but could be lowered to 0.1 or 0, considering no vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The malware scores are correctly at 0; no change needed.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard configuration class with no malicious or suspicious features.\n   - The environment variable usage is appropriate, and the error handling for missing credentials is standard.\n   - No obfuscation or malware is present, and the logic is straightforward.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0.1 to 0.2 is acceptable, but it could be lowered slightly to 0.1 to reflect minimal risk.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, well-structured, and does not contain malicious intent. The risk scores are reasonable but could be marginally lowered for even greater accuracy.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent risk due to handling of sensitive data, but no actual vulnerabilities)",
