  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the actual code, and then synthesize an overall security stance.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a straightforward configuration class managing API URL, default widths, and access tokens via environment variables, with standard getter/setter properties.  \n- No hidden or malicious code, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no data exfiltration routines are present.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the reports' reasoning and conclusions**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and securely handles environment variables for sensitive data.\n- They note the raising of an exception if the access token is missing, which is a typical pattern for credential validation.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified, and no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned**\n\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal risk from this configuration code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code only manages configuration via environment variables and raises an error if credentials are missing, the risk is minimal.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The environment variable approach is standard practice, not inherently risky.\n\n**Step 5: Critical assessment**\n\n- The code does not perform any network requests, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- The environment variables are used securely, and no secrets are hardcoded.\n- The raising of an exception on missing token is appropriate and does not introduce risk.\n\n**Step 6: Final evaluation and recommendations**\n\n- **Malware score:** Remains at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should be very low, around 0.1, reflecting standard configuration code with minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No.\n- **Errors/flaws in logic:** None.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (standard configuration, minor risk due to missing token handling, but very low)\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\nThis code is a typical configuration class for managing API credentials and endpoints, with no malicious or suspicious features. The environment variable usage aligns with best practices, and the exception handling for missing tokens is standard.\n\n**Therefore, I conclude:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment is consistent with all reports and the actual code.",
