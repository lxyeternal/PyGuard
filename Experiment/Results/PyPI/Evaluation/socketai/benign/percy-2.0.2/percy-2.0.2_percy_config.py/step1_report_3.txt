{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for Percy API integration, managing API URL, default widths, and access token.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PERCY_API' and 'PERCY_TOKEN' used as input sources.",
  "targets": "Access token retrieval triggers an exception if not set; potential use of API URL and token in network requests (not shown in this code).",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during class instantiation; access_token property access may raise an error if unset.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code structures or dynamic execution; proper encapsulation. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, setting configuration parameters with environment variables and properties. The only potential concern is raising an exception if the access token is missing, which is normal for credential validation. No suspicious or malicious logic, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and purely configuration-related with no evidence of malicious behavior. It securely retrieves environment variables for credentials and allows setting and getting configuration options.",
