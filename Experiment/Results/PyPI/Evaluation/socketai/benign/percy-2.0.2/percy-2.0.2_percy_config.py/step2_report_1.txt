  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:**\n- All reports describe a configuration class that reads environment variables (`PERCY_API`, `PERCY_TOKEN`) during initialization.\n- The code provided matches these descriptions exactly.\n- No discrepancies or missing features are noted.\n\n**2. Identify and record any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n- They mention that raising an exception if `access_token` is missing is a normal pattern.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the summaries.\n\n**3. Review the scores given to each issue:**\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), consistent with a configuration class that handles sensitive data via environment variables.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), reflecting agreement that the code is benign.\n- No adjustments seem necessary based on the code and reports.\n\n**4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk above 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- The only potential concern is the handling of sensitive credentials, but environment variables are standard practice.\n- The exception raised for missing tokens is a common pattern, not suspicious.\n\n**5. Pay close attention to malware scores:**\n- All malware scores are 0, which is correct given the benign nature of the code.\n- No malicious routines or backdoors are present.\n\n**6. Challenge any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward configuration management.\n- No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities are made.\n\n**7. Ensure scores are consistent with the report:**\n- The scores align well with the analysis: no malware, low security risk, high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal risk, primarily related to handling secrets via environment variables, which is standard.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical configuration class that securely manages sensitive data using environment variables. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested scores:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — slightly above zero due to handling secrets, but this is standard practice.\n\n**Note:** The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious or suspicious features. The existing scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
