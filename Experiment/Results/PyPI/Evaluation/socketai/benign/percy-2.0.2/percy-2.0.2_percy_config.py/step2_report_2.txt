  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines a `Config` class that manages API URL, default widths, and access token.\n   - It retrieves `PERCY_API` and `PERCY_TOKEN` from environment variables during initialization.\n   - The `access_token` property raises an `AuthError` if the token is not set, which is standard practice.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.\n   - The code appears straightforward and appropriate for configuration management.\n\n2. **Assessment of Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a standard configuration class.\n   - They note the use of environment variables for sensitive data, proper getter/setter methods, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating strong agreement.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The security risk scores are low (around 0.1 to 0.2), consistent with standard configuration code.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n   - No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The use of environment variables and raising errors on missing tokens is standard.\n   - No code injection, backdoors, or malicious routines are visible.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk scores are low, consistent with benign configuration code.\n   - The reports' scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports mention no suspicious or malicious activity, which aligns with the code.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is typical for configuration management.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious intent or backdoors.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the low but non-zero scores (around 0.1-0.2), these are appropriate considering the handling of sensitive data via environment variables and error raising, which is standard but still warrants minimal caution.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with standard configuration code with minimal security considerations)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code and reports indicate a benign, standard configuration class with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
