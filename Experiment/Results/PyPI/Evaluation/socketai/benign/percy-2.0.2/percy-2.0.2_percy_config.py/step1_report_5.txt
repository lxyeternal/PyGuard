  "purpose": "This code defines a configuration class for Percy API integration, managing API URL, default widths, and access token.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables 'PERCY_API' and 'PERCY_TOKEN' for configuration values during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Access token retrieval can raise an error if not set, but does not leak or misuse data; no external sinks found.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during object initialization to set internal attributes; access token is accessed via property, potentially raising an error if unset.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; standard environment variable usage. No suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The class uses environment variables to securely manage API credentials, with proper getter/setter methods. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and appropriate for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class with secure handling of environment variables. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
