  "purpose": "This code defines a configuration class for interacting with the Percy API, managing API URL, default widths, and access tokens.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PERCY_API' and 'PERCY_TOKEN' used as data sources for API URL and access token.",
  "sinks": "Access token retrieval triggers an exception if not set; no dangerous sink identified. No other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during initialization to set internal state; access_token property raises exception if missing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets are absent; environment variables are used securely. No suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages configuration parameters with environment variables and property setters/getters. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. Proper exception handling for missing token is in place. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It uses environment variables securely to manage sensitive data without hardcoding secrets or malicious logic.",
