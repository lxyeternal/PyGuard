  "purpose": "Manage API URL, default widths, and access token configuration via environment variables with validation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PERCY_API' and 'PERCY_TOKEN' during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Access token retrieval; raising errors if token is missing.",
  "flows": "Initialization reads environment variables; access_token property may raise error if token absent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; straightforward environment variable handling and error raising.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple configuration class that retrieves sensitive data from environment variables, with proper getter/setter methods and validation. No malicious routines, obfuscation, or insecure practices are present. The use of environment variables is standard, and raising an error for missing tokens is appropriate. The code is clear, minimal, and aligns with best practices for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It securely manages credentials using environment variables and performs standard validation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
