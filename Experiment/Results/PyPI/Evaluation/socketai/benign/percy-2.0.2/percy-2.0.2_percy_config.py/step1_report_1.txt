  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for Percy API interaction, managing API URL, default widths, and access token.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PERCY_API' and 'PERCY_TOKEN' are read during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The access token is retrieved via a property which could be used in authorization headers; environment variables are used to store sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during object instantiation to set API URL and access token; the access token is accessed via a property that may raise an error if unset.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive credentials is standard; no unusual or suspicious code behavior. No hardcoded secrets are present. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates configuration data with getters and setters. Sensitive data is retrieved from environment variables, which is a common practice. The access_token property raises an error if unset, which ensures proper authentication but does not involve suspicious behavior. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic. No obfuscated code, cryptojacking, or data exfiltration routines are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration class for managing API settings with environment variables, showing no malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to common practices without suspicious or malicious code features.",
