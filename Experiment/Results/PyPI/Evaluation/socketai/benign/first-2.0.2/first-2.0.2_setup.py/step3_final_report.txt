{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'first' Python module, reading static files for metadata and importing local module attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst', 'HISTORY.rst', 'AUTHORS.rst' files; imports 'first' module for version and author info.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network activity, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Static file reads and local attribute access; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; conditional import for 'codecs' is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script performing package metadata configuration. It reads static files for long descriptions, imports 'first' for versioning info, and calls setup() with standard classifiers. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious intent or security concerns. All signals and scores are appropriate.",
