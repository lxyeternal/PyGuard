{
  "purpose": "Utility function to retrieve the first element in an iterable that evaluates to True, with optional default and key predicate.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'iterable', the optional 'default' value, and the 'key' predicate function provided as arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; it only processes input data and returns a value.",
  "flows": "The function iterates over the 'iterable', applying either direct truthiness checks or the 'key' predicate, returning the first match, or 'default' if none found.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward and implements standard functionality without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility function with clear logic. It iterates over an input iterable, returning the first element that is truthy or matches a predicate. It supports an optional default value. There are no signs of malicious code, external data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is well-documented, using standard Python idioms. No external calls, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The overall structure is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs a common, well-understood operation safely.",
