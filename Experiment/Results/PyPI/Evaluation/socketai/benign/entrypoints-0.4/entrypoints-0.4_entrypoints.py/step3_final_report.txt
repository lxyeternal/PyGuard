  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns or obfuscation detected; reliance on external data for dynamic import introduces inherent risk",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard plugin entry point loader, reading configuration files and zip archives to identify entry points. It uses regex to parse entry point strings, then dynamically imports modules and accesses objects via getattr. No malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The primary security concern is that external configuration data (entry point strings) can specify arbitrary modules and attributes, leading to potential execution of malicious code if the data is maliciously crafted. The code itself is straightforward and safe, but the dynamic import mechanism can be exploited if untrusted data is introduced. The malware score should reflect the potential for malicious activity stemming from external data, not from the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign plugin loader that performs standard discovery and dynamic import of modules based on external configuration. While it inherently carries risks associated with executing arbitrary code from untrusted sources, the code itself is not malicious. The high malware score previously assigned in some reports (e.g., 0.7) overstates the threat; a more accurate assessment would set malware at approximately 0.1–0.2, with a moderate security risk around 0.2–0.3. Obfuscation is not present. Proper validation of entry point data would mitigate risks.",
