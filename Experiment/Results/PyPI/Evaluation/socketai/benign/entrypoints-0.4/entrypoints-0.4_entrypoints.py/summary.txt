  "conclusion": "The script is a benign plugin loader that performs standard discovery and dynamic import of modules based on external configuration. While it inherently carries risks associated with executing arbitrary code from untrusted sources, the code itself is not malicious. The high malware score previously assigned in some reports (e.g., 0.7) overstates the threat; a more accurate assessment would set malware at approximately 0.1–0.2, with a moderate security risk around 0.2–0.3. Obfuscation is not present. Proper validation of entry point data would mitigate risks."
