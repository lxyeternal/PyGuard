      "conclusion": "The script is a benign plugin loader that performs standard discovery and dynamic import of modules based on external configuration. While it inherently carries risks associated with executing arbitrary code from untrusted sources, the code itself is not malicious. The high malware score previously assigned in some reports (e.g., 0.7) overstates the threat; a more accurate assessment would set malware at approximately 0.1–0.2, with a moderate security risk around 0.2–0.3. Obfuscation is not present. Proper validation of entry point data would mitigate risks."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. The analysis confirms that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's static and standard nature."

The dynamic loading is within a testing environment and does not pose a threat. Scores are Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (reflecting the dynamic import aspect but justified given the context)."
