  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, file operations, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., network, file system), potentially via malicious data processing or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual data flows, hidden backdoors, malicious system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is absent; only high-level descriptions are provided. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. Scores are set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a low security risk score of 0.2 reflecting cautious baseline. Confidence is high where code is described, low where code is missing. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and the overall assessment indicates benign code with minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given the limited information. Overall, the dependency does not pose a supply chain threat based on the provided analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
