{
  "purpose": "The code appears to load and deploy a WSGI application based on a provided configuration.",
  "sources": "Input data is the 'config' dictionary passed to the deploy() function.",
  "sinks": "The load_app() function imported from the same package, which may process the config data.",
  "flows": "The config dictionary flows from the deploy() function into load_app(), which then likely processes it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The function is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a load_app function from a local core module and defines deploy() that calls load_app() with the provided config. The comment indicates the config is a dictionary of filenames used to configure a WSGI app. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation within this snippet. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of load_app(), which is not provided. The code is minimal and standard, with no evident malicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple wrapper around load_app(), with no apparent malicious intent or security issues within this fragment. Security concerns hinge on the load_app() implementation. Based on this code alone, it appears benign.",
