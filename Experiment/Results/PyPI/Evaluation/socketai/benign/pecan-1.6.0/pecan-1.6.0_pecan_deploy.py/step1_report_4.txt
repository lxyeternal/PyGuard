  "purpose": "Load and deploy a WSGI application based on provided configuration.",
  "sources": "Input data is the 'config' dictionary parameter passed to the 'deploy' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'load_app' function call, which likely processes the config to load an application.",
  "flows": "Input 'config' -> 'load_app' -> application setup and deployment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'load_app' from a relative module '.core'. The 'deploy' function accepts a configuration dictionary and returns the result of 'load_app(config)'. There is no evidence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious data handling. The security depends on the implementation of 'load_app', which is not provided here. As it stands, this code is a simple wrapper that delegates to another function, with no apparent malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward deployment wrapper with no visible malicious behavior or security risks. Its safety largely depends on the implementation of 'load_app' in the '.core' module, which is not provided. No malicious activity or security threats are detected based on this snippet alone.",
