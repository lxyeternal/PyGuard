  "purpose": "Load and deploy a WSGI application based on a configuration dictionary.",
  "sources": "The 'config' parameter passed to the 'deploy' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'load_app' function, which likely processes the 'config' data to load an application.",
  "flows": "The 'deploy' function receives 'config' -> passes it to 'load_app' -> returns the application object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple deploy function that calls 'load_app' with a configuration dictionary. The function's purpose appears to be to initialize an application based on provided configuration data. There are no signs of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code. The reliance on an external 'load_app' function means that any security issues would depend on that implementation, but within this code snippet, nothing suspicious is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears benign. It functions as a simple wrapper around 'load_app' to initialize a WSGI app using provided configuration. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected within this code fragment.",
