  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a very simple wrapper function that calls `load_app(config)` and returns its result.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code are evident.\n- The core concern is the behavior of `load_app`, which is imported from a local module (`.core`). Since its implementation is unknown, the security implications are uncertain.\n- The code itself appears benign and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-issue review:\n\n#### Reports 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  No. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic:**  \n  None. The logic is simple: pass `config` to `load_app` and return the result.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  - `malware`: 0  \n  - `obfuscated`: 0  \n  - `securityRisk`: ranges from 0.1 to 0.2  \n  - `confidence`: 0.8–0.9\n\n  These seem reasonable given the code snippet. The low `malware` and `obfuscated` scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  None. All are below 0.5, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since there's no evidence of malicious behavior within this code, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  The reports correctly state that the security depends on `load_app`. Without its implementation, we cannot assess potential vulnerabilities, but the code itself is not suspicious.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports do not mention any code obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The code is a simple delegator; any security issues would stem from `load_app`.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- Based solely on this code snippet, **0** is appropriate.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- The code is clear and straightforward, so **0** is appropriate.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- Given the minimal code and no evident malicious behavior, a low risk score (~0.1–0.2) is justified. The reports' scores of 0.1–0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**Overall:**  \n- The reports are accurate and cautious, correctly noting that the security posture depends on the implementation of `load_app`.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since the main concern is the unknown `load_app`, but the code itself is benign)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, minimal wrapper function. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet. The real security concern hinges on the implementation of `load_app`, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
