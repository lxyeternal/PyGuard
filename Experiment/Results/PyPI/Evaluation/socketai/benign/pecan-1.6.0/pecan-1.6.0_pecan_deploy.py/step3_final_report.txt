{
  "purpose": "A minimal wrapper function that loads and returns an application based on provided configuration.",
  "sources": "The function takes 'config' as input; the 'load_app' function is imported from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input 'config' flows into 'load_app', which then returns its result; no other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper that delegates to 'load_app'. Its security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'load_app', which is external and not provided. The code itself shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily contingent on the external 'load_app' implementation. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary based solely on this snippet.",
