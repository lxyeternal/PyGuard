  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple wrapper that calls `load_app(config)`.\n- The core concern hinges on the implementation of `load_app`, which is not provided.\n- The code itself is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain any embedded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious code in this snippet.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1-0.2), which seems appropriate given the minimal code and reliance on external functions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that the code is a thin wrapper around `load_app`. No issues, anomalies, or vulnerabilities are evident in this snippet.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors:**  \n  None. All reports correctly state that the security implications depend on `load_app`'s implementation, which is unknown here.\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is reasonable. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n### Recommendations on Scores:\n- The **malware score** of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is indicated.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- The **security risk** scores are low, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate. The code is benign on its own, and risks depend on `load_app`.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- Since the code is just a wrapper, **any potential vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors** are **entirely dependent on `load_app`**. Without that code, we cannot assess security risks fully.\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities based solely on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, given the code's simplicity and dependency on external implementation)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, as the code is straightforward and benign)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and cautious. They correctly identify that the security posture hinges on `load_app`. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident in this code snippet. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
