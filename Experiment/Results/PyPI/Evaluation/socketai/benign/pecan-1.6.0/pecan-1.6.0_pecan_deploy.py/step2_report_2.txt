  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a simple wrapper function that calls `load_app(config)` and returns its result.\n   - The code itself is minimal, with no embedded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The actual behavior and security implications depend entirely on the implementation of `load_app`, which is imported from a local module and not shown here.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code snippet itself does not contain issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign and straightforward.\n   - They correctly note that security concerns hinge on `load_app`'s implementation.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: mostly 0.1 to 0.2\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - **Suggestion:** No adjustments needed; scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2.\n   - Given the code's benign nature, this is appropriate.\n   - If any future concern arises from `load_app`, that would need reevaluation, but based on this snippet alone, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` as 0, which is justified since there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n   - The code is a simple delegation to another function, with no signs of malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they acknowledge that security depends on `load_app`.\n   - No unwarranted claims about vulnerabilities are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code and the cautious stance regarding external dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (low, given the dependency on external `load_app` implementation, but the code itself is safe)\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n- The code snippet appears safe and benign.\n- The security posture should be evaluated further once the implementation of `load_app` is known.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward wrapper with no malicious intent.\n- The current scores accurately reflect the analysis.\n- Continue monitoring the implementation of `load_app` for potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
