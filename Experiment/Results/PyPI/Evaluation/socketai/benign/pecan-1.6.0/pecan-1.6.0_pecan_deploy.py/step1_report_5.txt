{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to load and return a WSGI application based on a provided configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'config' parameter passed to the 'deploy' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'load_app' function, which likely processes the config to instantiate a web application.",
  "flows": "Input 'config' -> 'load_app' -> returns WSGI app.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'load_app' from a local module, then defines a 'deploy' function that takes a configuration dictionary and returns a WSGI application loaded via 'load_app'. The docstring suggests the config is a dictionary with relative filenames, used to set up the app. No data is being transmitted or processed insecurely within this snippet. The code is minimal, and there are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. Since 'load_app' is imported from a local module, its behavior is unknown, but based on this code alone, it appears to be a standard application loader.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward and benign application loader function with no evident malicious activity or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
