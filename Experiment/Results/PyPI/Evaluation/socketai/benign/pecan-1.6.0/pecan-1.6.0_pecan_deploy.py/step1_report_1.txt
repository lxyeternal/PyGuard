{
  "purpose": "Load and deploy a WSGI application based on a given configuration.",
  "sources": "The function receives a 'config' parameter, which is expected to be a dictionary of relative filenames.",
  "sinks": "The 'load_app' function call may process the 'config' data; potential for data leakage or misbehavior depends on its implementation.",
  "flows": "The 'config' parameter flows directly into 'load_app', which may process or load data based on the config.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with a simple wrapper; no obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'deploy' that takes a configuration dictionary and returns the result of 'load_app(config)'. There are no embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The security of the code largely depends on 'load_app', which is imported from a relative module. Without seeing 'load_app', it's impossible to fully assess potential malicious behavior, but this code itself appears benign, serving as a thin wrapper. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are evident here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears benign. Its security posture depends on the implementation of 'load_app', but this snippet alone does not indicate malicious intent or security risks.",
