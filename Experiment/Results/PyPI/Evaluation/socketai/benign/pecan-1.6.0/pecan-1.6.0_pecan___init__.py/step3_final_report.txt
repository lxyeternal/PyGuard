{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Pecan web application, configuring middleware, logging, error handling, static file serving, and debugging features based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (e.g., 'logging', 'debug', 'static_root', 'wrap_app') and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Middleware wrapping, logging configuration, warnings, environment variables within debug middleware, and application instantiation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence middleware stacking and configuration; environment variables are accessed during debug middleware setup; warnings are issued based on parameters; the app object is created and wrapped accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic; use of warnings for deprecated features is standard; environment variables are accessed only within debugging context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard application factory for a Pecan-based web app, involving configuration, middleware stacking, logging setup, error handling, static file serving, and debug features. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of environment variables in debug mode is typical for request inspection. Warnings about deprecated parameters are normal. The logic is straightforward and aligns with best practices for web app initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to development features. The current scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1–0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
