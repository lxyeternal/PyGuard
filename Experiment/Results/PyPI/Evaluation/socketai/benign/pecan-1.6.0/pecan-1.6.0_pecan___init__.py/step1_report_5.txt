  "purpose": "This code defines a utility function for creating a Pecan web application, configuring logging, middleware, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (not explicitly shown), configuration objects, function parameters (root, static_root, debug, wrap_app, logging), warnings, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Logging configuration, middleware wrapping, error handling, warnings, and the final WSGI application object.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from parameters and objects into logging setup and middleware wrapping; environment and configuration objects influence middleware behavior; the final app object is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of warnings and configuration setup appears standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles application setup: configuring logging, middleware, and static file serving based on parameters. It uses standard Python practices and imported modules for web application construction. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage, such as code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity. The use of warnings for deprecated features and static file handling in debug mode is typical for development environments. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical application setup utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It manages configuration, logging, middleware, and debug features safely and transparently.",
