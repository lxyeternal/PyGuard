  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a web framework with no malicious intent. The primary security considerations involve ensuring that the root controller string used in dynamic import is controlled and sanitized, and that the global 'state' object is protected from manipulation. No malware or obfuscation is present. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are accurate; the moderate security risk (~0.2) reflects potential misuse if inputs are untrusted or configuration is insecure."
