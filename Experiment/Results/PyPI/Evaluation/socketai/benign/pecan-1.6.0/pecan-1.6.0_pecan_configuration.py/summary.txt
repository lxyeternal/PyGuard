  "conclusion": "The primary security risk stems from executing untrusted configuration files and dynamically loading modules that execute code. While no malicious code is embedded, the pattern is dangerous and could be exploited if configuration files are compromised. Malware scores should be increased to reflect this potential, and overall risk remains high. The code should be refactored to validate or sandbox external inputs to mitigate this risk."
