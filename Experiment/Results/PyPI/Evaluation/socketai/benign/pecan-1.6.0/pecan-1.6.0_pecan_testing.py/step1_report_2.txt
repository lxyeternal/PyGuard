{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for loading a Pecan web application for testing purposes and resetting configuration to a default state.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PECAN_CONFIG) and configuration data from function parameters or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variable manipulation (os.environ.pop) and imports from external modules (pecan, webtest). No data sinks appear to handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variable PECAN_CONFIG influences configuration load; configuration setting and environment variable removal are internal operations. No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code relies on standard libraries and known frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules and defines functions for testing and resetting configurations. It conditionally loads configurations from environment variables or parameters, then wraps a web application for testing. It manipulates environment variables securely by removing them after use. No user input processing or external data handling that could lead to vulnerabilities is observed. The use of external modules is typical for web app testing; no obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as utility functions for application testing and configuration management. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or malicious payloads. The overall security risk is minimal.",
