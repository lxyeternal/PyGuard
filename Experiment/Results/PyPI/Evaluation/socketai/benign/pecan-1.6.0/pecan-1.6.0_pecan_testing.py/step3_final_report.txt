  "purpose": "Utility functions for testing a Pecan web application, including loading test app instances with configurable settings and resetting global configuration to avoid test pollution.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PECAN_CONFIG', parameters passed to functions, module imports ('pecan', 'webtest', 'os')",
  "sinks": "load_app function call with configuration data, environment variable manipulation (pop), return of TestApp instance",
  "flows": "Configuration data from parameters or environment variable flows into load_app; environment variable 'PECAN_CONFIG' influences configuration; no external data flows or network activity",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, purpose-specific testing utilities for Pecan applications. It safely manipulates environment variables, dynamically imports modules at runtime, and loads configurations from trusted sources. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The environment variable handling is standard and safe within controlled testing environments. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the context, though a risk score of 0 could also be justified. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and contains no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing purposes, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and scores are consistent with the code's purpose. No modifications are necessary; the code can be considered safe in the context of testing utilities.",
