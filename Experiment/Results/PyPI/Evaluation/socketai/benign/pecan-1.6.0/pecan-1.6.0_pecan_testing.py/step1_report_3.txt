{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for loading a Pecan web application for testing purposes and resetting global configuration settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PECAN_CONFIG' in os.environ, user input parameters 'config' and '**kwargs', imported modules 'pecan' and 'webtest'.",
  "sinks": "load_app function (potentially executing user-provided configuration), environment variable modification via os.environ.pop.",
  "flows": "User or environment supplies 'config' or environment variable influences load_app; configuration.set_config may process data from imported modules; environment variable 'PECAN_CONFIG' may be altered or removed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. The code imports modules only at runtime for efficiency, which is a normal practice. The use of environment variables and configuration functions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for testing a Pecan web app and resetting configurations. It imports modules conditionally and manipulates environment variables in a typical manner. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The environment variable 'PECAN_CONFIG' is managed responsibly, and user inputs are limited to configuration parameters for loading the app. No suspicious network activity or harmful code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for testing and configuration management within a Python web application framework. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or malware present.",
