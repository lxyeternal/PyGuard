  "purpose": "Customizes log formatting with color support, but mainly issues a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "Input data can be log records processed by the format method.",
  "sinks": "Formatted log output; no data leaks or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Log record created and formatted through format method; no external data flow or untrusted input handling beyond standard logging.",
  "anomalies": "Deprecation warning issued in __init__, but no malicious or suspicious behavior. The format method modifies record attributes but does not perform any harmful operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom logging formatter that adds color-related attributes but currently does not implement actual coloring. It issues a deprecation warning suggesting to use an alternative library. No untrusted data processing, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious custom log formatter that emits a deprecation warning. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
