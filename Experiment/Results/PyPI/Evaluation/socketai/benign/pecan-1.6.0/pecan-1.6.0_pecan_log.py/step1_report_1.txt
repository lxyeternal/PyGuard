{
  "purpose": "Define a custom logging formatter that adds color features, with a deprecation warning indicating the class is outdated.",
  "sources": "Import statements for logging and warnings modules; class constructor which initializes logging formatter and issues a warning.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Constructor calls superclass init, then issues a deprecation warning; format method modifies record but does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated warning indicating the class is obsolete; no actual implementation of color formatting or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of logging.Formatter, primarily to issue a deprecation warning. The format method adds placeholders for color but does not perform any actual coloring or complex processing. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and no external data sources or sinks are involved beyond standard logging procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, deprecated custom logging formatter that does not perform any malicious activity. It may be part of legacy code but poses no security risk.",
