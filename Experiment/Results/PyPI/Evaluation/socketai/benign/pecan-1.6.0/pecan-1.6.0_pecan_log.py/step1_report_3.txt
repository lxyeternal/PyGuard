  "purpose": "Define a custom logging formatter that issues a deprecation warning but otherwise formats log records.",
  "sources": "The import statements and the __init__ and format methods within the ColorFormatter class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data flows are present; the code only customizes log formatting.",
  "flows": "The code initializes a formatter and issues a warning; no data flows from input to sink in a malicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a deprecated class with a warning; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of logging.Formatter, adding a deprecation warning upon initialization. The format method adds or modifies attributes on the record object but does not execute any untrusted code or perform data exfiltration. No sources, sinks, or malicious data flows are present. The only noteworthy point is the use of a deprecated class with a warning, indicating possible outdated practice but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless, deprecated custom logging formatter that does not contain malware or security risks. It may be outdated but poses no threat.",
