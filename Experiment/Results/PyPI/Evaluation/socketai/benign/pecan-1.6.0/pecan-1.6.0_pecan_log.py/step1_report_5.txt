  "purpose": "Custom logging formatter that adds color support, with a deprecation warning for future users.",
  "sources": "Import statements (logging, warn), class initialization, format method, and deprecated warning call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow; the code only manipulates logging records and issues a warning.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated features, which might suggest outdated or unsupported code; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom logging formatter intended for colored output, but it issues a deprecation warning indicating it is no longer supported. It does not process external input or perform any operations beyond formatting log records and issuing a warning. There are no suspicious or malicious actions, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The usage of deprecated features suggests that this code may be outdated, but it does not pose a security risk by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, deprecated custom formatter for logging with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided content.",
