{
  "purpose": "Provides a permission-based security layer for web controllers, allowing methods and attributes to be secured or unlocked via decorators and class meta-programming, with permission checks delegated to user-defined functions.",
  "sources": "Configuration functions (_cfg), class members (getmembers), decorators, and dynamic attribute access (getattr).",
  "sinks": "Raising HTTPUnauthorized upon failed permission checks, invoking permission functions via getattr, and returning secured or unsecured attributes.",
  "flows": "Permission functions are invoked through dynamic getattr calls, which determine access control; failures lead to exceptions; decorators modify function attributes to enforce security.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic getattr with permission strings could be exploited if strings are externally controlled, but within the code, this pattern is standard and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard security pattern for web controllers, with decorators marking methods and attributes as secured or unlocked. Permission checks are delegated to external functions, invoked via string attribute lookups, which is typical but could pose risks if permission strings are manipulated externally. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of class meta-programming and decorators aligns with common practices. The dynamic invocation via strings is a potential vector if misused, but in controlled environments, it is safe. The overall structure is clear, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured security framework for web controllers, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. The low risk score (0.2) is justified, assuming trusted permission functions. No obfuscation or malware is detected.",
