The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (0.1-0.2) are justified. Overall, it appears safe and trustworthy."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The primary security risk stems from executing untrusted configuration files and dynamically loading modules that execute code. While no malicious code is embedded, the pattern is dangerous and could be exploited if configuration files are compromised. Malware scores should be increased to reflect this potential, and overall risk remains high. The code should be refactored to validate or sandbox external inputs to mitigate this risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a web framework with no malicious intent. The primary security considerations involve ensuring that the root controller string used in dynamic import is controlled and sanitized, and that the global 'state' object is protected from manipulation. No malware or obfuscation is present. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are accurate; the moderate security risk (~0.2) reflects potential misuse if inputs are untrusted or configuration is insecure."
