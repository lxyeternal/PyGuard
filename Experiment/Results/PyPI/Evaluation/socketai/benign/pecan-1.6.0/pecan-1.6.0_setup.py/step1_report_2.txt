{
  "purpose": "The script is for configuring the setup and installation of the 'pecan' Python web framework package, including dependency management and entry point configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and 'test-requirements.txt', importing modules such as sys, platform, setuptools, and collections.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data is written to files, network, or environment variables in this script.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are read from files, and setup() is called with the collected data; no untrusted data flows from external sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscated parts, or unusual behaviors. Use of try-except for fallback imports is standard. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: reading requirements, managing dependencies based on Python version, and configuring package metadata and entry points. No malicious or maliciously suspicious activity is present. All operations are typical for a setup script. No network activity, data leaks, or privilege escalations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for a Python package without malicious intent or suspicious activity. No security issues are identified.",
