  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected across all reports.\n- The code reads dependency files, manages conditional dependencies, and calls `setup()` with package metadata and entry points.\n- No untrusted data processing, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is consistent with a typical setup script.\n- No issues are present in the code based on the reports.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical or security flaws are evident.\n- The only minor point is the use of broad exception handling (`except:`), which is generally discouraged but common in setup scripts for fallback imports. This is not a security concern here.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, justified by the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- No reason exists to assign a higher risk score; the code is standard and safe.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The only point to consider is the reliance on external files (`requirements.txt`, `test-requirements.txt`). If these files are malicious or tampered with, dependency management could be compromised. However, in the context of a setup script, this is a standard practice, and the files are assumed to be trusted.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n**Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical setup script for a Python package.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- All scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
