{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures the Python package 'pecan', including dependency management, metadata, and entry points for command-line interfaces.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'requirements.txt' and 'test-requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No significant sink points for untrusted data. The setup() function is called with predefined arguments.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads into lists (requirements, test_requirements), which are then used in the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code reads dependency files, processes their contents, manages conditional requirements based on Python version and implementation, and calls setup() with package metadata and configurations. The handling of dependencies is standard, with fallback packages for older Python versions. No external or untrusted data is processed beyond file reading, and no suspicious or malicious code behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard, legitimate setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
