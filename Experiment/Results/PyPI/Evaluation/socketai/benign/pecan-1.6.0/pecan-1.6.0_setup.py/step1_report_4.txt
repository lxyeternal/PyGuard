{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'pecan', defining its requirements, metadata, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' and 'test-requirements.txt' files for dependencies; importing modules like sys, platform, setuptools, functools, collections.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external outputs are directly manipulated or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code primarily reads local files and defines package configuration, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. The use of try-except blocks for compatibility is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads dependencies from local files, handles compatibility for older Python versions, and configures package setup parameters. The approach is typical for a Python package setup script. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
