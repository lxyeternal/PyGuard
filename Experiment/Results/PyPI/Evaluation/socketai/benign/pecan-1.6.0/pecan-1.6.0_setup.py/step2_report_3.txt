  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no malicious activity. The dependency management and package configuration are typical.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risk identified.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a benign setup script with standard practices.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security issues.\n- **Conclusion:** The evaluation aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical setup script with dependency management and environment checks. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security concerns.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard package setup, no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risks.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, straightforward setup script.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Analysis:\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0.0, which is appropriate. The code performs no malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0.0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk:** All are 0.0, which aligns with the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Overall:\nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependency management and environment checks are standard practices.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the code provided.",
