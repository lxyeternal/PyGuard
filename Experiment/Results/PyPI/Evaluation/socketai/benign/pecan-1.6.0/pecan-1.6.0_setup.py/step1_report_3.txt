{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup and dependencies for the 'pecan' Python web framework package, including reading requirements files and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' and 'test-requirements.txt' files; accesses sys and platform modules; imports from setuptools; attempts to import 'singledispatch' and 'OrderedDict'; retrieves Python version info.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to untrusted sinks or data leaks. The setup configuration and dependency management do not process external untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "Reads dependency files -> modifies requirements list based on Python version -> passes requirements to setup() -> defines package metadata and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs dependency management and package setup using standard practices. It reads requirements files and conditionally adds dependencies based on the environment. The use of try-except blocks for optional imports and environment checks are common and benign. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscated code is present. The entry points are for CLI commands, which are typical for a setup script. Overall, this appears to be a standard setup configuration script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
