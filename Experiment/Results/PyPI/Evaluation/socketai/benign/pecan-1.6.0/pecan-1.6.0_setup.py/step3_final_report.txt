  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, managing dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' and 'test-requirements.txt' files for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static dependency lists, no external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Dependency files to requirements lists; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: reading dependencies, handling environment-specific dependencies, and calling setup() with package info. The use of broad exception handling is common in setup scripts but not suspicious. No obfuscated code, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The dependency files are assumed to be trusted, and the code structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and reports align, confirming its safe nature.",
