  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the script as a standard setup.py for a Python package ('pecan').\n- No suspicious or malicious code is mentioned or observed.\n- The code involves reading dependency files, conditional dependencies based on environment, and calling setup() with package metadata.\n- No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code is typical for a package setup script.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a package setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious sinks; standard flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully benign, high confidence, malware score 0.\n\n**Score suggestion:** The malware score is 0, security risk 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard dependency management and setup.\n- No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully benign, malware score 0.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Confirm malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Highlights the use of try-except for optional dependencies, standard practice.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of maliciousness, malware score 0.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar to previous, standard dependency reading and setup.\n- No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, malware 0.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Reiterates the standard setup pattern.\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully benign, malware 0.\n\n**Score suggestion:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** No.\n- **Dependency reading and environment checks:** Standard, no malicious implications.\n- **Scores assigned in reports:** All are 0 for malware and security risk, which is appropriate.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None identified; the script performs typical setup tasks.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**The reports are consistent and accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behavior is present. The scores given are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
