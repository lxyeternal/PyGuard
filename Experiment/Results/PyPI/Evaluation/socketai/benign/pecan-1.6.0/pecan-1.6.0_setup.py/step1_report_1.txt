{
  "purpose": "This script is used for configuring and setting up a Python package named 'pecan', including reading dependencies, defining package metadata, and entry points for command-line tools.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements from 'requirements.txt' and 'test-requirements.txt'; obtaining system information via sys and platform modules; importing setuptools for package setup.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function and the list of dependencies are standard and do not lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reading requirements files -> determining dependencies -> passing dependencies to setup() -> defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code performs typical setup tasks without dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package configuration, dependency management, and metadata definition. It conditionally adds dependencies based on Python version and environment, which is standard practice. All imported modules and file reads are for setup purposes and do not involve untrusted data processing or execution. No malicious or suspicious behavior, such as network activity, backdoors, or code injection, is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected package configuration tasks securely.",
