{
  "purpose": "The code contains functions for printing greetings and downloading/processing files from URLs, with offensive language present.",
  "sources": "The 'smm' function reads data from an external URL via requests.get.",
  "sinks": "The processed data is written to 'processed_file.txt' on disk.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL input in 'smm' to the file write operation; no other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of offensive language ('nigger') in function name and docstring; redundant 'file.close()' after 'with' block; lack of exception handling and input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads external data, processes it, and writes to disk without validation or error handling. Offensive language indicates poor coding practices and ethical concerns but does not constitute malicious behavior. No signs of malware such as code execution, data exfiltration, or network connections to suspicious domains are present. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The main risks are related to poor hygiene and offensive content, not security exploits.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in terms of malicious activity but contains offensive language and coding hygiene issues. There is no evidence of malware or malicious payloads. The security risk score is low, and the malware score is zero. The primary concern is ethical and quality-related, not security.",
