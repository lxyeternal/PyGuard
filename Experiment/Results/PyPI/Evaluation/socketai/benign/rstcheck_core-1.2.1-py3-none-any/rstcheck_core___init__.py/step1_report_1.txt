  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, with standard logging setup; no unusual behavior or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the future annotations feature, then sets up a logger named 'rstcheck' with a NullHandler, preventing logging output unless explicitly configured elsewhere. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors, nor any code that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
