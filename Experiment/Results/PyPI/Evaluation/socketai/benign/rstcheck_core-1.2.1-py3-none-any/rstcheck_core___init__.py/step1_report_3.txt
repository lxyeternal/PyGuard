  "anomalies": "The code only sets up logging with a NullHandler, which is standard practice to prevent logging errors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ annotations for compatibility, then configures the logging for 'rstcheck' with a NullHandler, preventing logging errors if no handlers are set. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup snippet for logging configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
