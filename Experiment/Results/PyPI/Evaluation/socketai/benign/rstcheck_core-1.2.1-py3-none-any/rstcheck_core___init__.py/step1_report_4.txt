  "flows": "No data flow from external input to any output or sink",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger for 'rstcheck' and adds a NullHandler to suppress logging output. This is standard practice for Python packages to avoid 'No handler found' warnings. No input sources, sinks, or data flows are present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only configures logging behavior without any malicious intent or security risks.",
