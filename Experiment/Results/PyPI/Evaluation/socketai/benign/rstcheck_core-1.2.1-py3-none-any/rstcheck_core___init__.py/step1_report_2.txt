  "purpose": "Initialize the module with logging configuration for the 'rstcheck' package.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input, or output paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code behavior; only standard logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for compatibility, then configures logging for the 'rstcheck' package by adding a NullHandler. This is a common practice to prevent logging warnings when no handlers are attached. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving only as a logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign logging configuration for the package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
