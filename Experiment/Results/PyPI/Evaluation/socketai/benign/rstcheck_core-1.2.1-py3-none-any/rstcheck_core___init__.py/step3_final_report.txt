  "purpose": "Setup for logging configuration in a Python package, establishing a logger with a NullHandler to prevent logging errors if no handlers are configured.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code imports __future__.annotations and sets up a logger.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only initializes logging infrastructure without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of data sources, sinks, or suspicious code; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward setup for logging in a Python package. It imports __future__.annotations for forward reference support and configures a logger named 'rstcheck' with a NullHandler to avoid logging errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external communications. The code is standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
