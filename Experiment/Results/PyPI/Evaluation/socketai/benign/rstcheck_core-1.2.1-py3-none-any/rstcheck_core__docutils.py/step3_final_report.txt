  "purpose": "Helper functions for managing docutils directives and roles, including ignoring unknown directives/roles, reloading modules, and registering code block directives.",
  "sources": "Standard docutils modules, importlib.reload, registration functions accepting directive/role names.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Internal registration and module reloads without untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.reload and dynamic registration could be misused if external input is malicious, but in this context, they are controlled and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing utility functions for extension management in docutils. It involves safe module reloading and registration of dummy directives/roles. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The dynamic registration functions accept explicit parameters and do not process untrusted data directly. The reloads are limited to docutils modules, which is safe. The overall behavior is benign, with minimal security risk primarily related to potential misuse if misconfigured, but no actual malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign helper module for docutils extensions, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
