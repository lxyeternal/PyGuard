  "purpose": "Helper functions for managing docutils directives and roles, including registering and ignoring certain directives and roles, and defining custom directives.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'ignore_role', 'ignore_directives_and_roles', and 'register_code_directive'; content of code blocks in 'CodeBlockDirective.run'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily registers directives and roles or processes content locally without external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions like 'ignore_directives_and_roles' and 'register_code_directive'; 'CodeBlockDirective.run' converts content into a literal block; no external data flow or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. The code appears to be standard for docutils extension management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions and classes for managing docutils directives and roles, including stub implementations and registration mechanisms. It performs module reloading, directive registration, and content handling in a straightforward, expected manner. No external data access, network operations, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions are designed for local processing and configuration of docutils, which are standard in documentation generation workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard docutils helper functions for managing directives and roles with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It mainly facilitates documentation processing without external data leaks or harmful actions.",
