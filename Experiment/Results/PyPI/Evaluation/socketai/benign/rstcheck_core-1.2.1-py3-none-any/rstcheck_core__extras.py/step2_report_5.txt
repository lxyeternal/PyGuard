  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual behavior, the scoring rationale, and any potential inconsistencies or concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages optional dependencies, performs version checks, raises errors if dependencies are missing or unsupported. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned. The code is straightforward dependency management with no suspicious elements.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency checks for 'sphinx' and 'tomli', raising informative errors if missing or unsupported. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n- **Justification for securityRisk=0.1:** Since the code raises errors with detailed messages, there's a minor potential for information leakage if error messages are exploited. However, this is standard and not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The score seems reasonable. The low securityRisk reflects the minimal risk from error message leakage.\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency verification with version checks and exception raising. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. No malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Dependency checks with standard functions, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Justification for securityRisk=0:** The code only raises exceptions if dependencies are missing, which is standard. No evidence of data leaks or malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The slight reduction in confidence (0.9) might reflect the potential for error message leakage, but overall, the code remains safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly lower confidence is justified, but securityRisk=0 remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard dependency checks, no suspicious activity, only raises exceptions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n- **Justification:** Similar to previous, minimal risk from error messages.\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Mostly 0, with some at 0.1, justified by the potential for error message leakage. Given the code's nature, this is reasonable.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (due to detailed error messages that could, in theory, leak info if exploited, but this is standard and not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\nThe reports are consistent, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security risk score is justified by the potential for error message information leakage, which is common in dependency checks.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe dependency management utility with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; the current scoring and analysis are accurate.",
