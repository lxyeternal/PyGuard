{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality to check if optional dependencies ('sphinx' and 'tomli') are installed with supported versions and offers guard functions to enforce their presence.",
  "sources": "Import statements, importlib.metadata.version(), importlib.import_module(), usage of importlib and logging modules.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or system modifications; error messages are raised when dependencies are missing.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking if dependencies are installed with supported versions, then raising ModuleNotFoundError if not, based on the guards.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are observed. The code performs standard dependency checks and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency management by checking installed versions and raising errors if dependencies are missing or unsupported. It uses standard Python importlib and metadata functions without obfuscated or malicious constructs. No suspicious external connections, code injections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The guard functions only raise exceptions for missing dependencies, which is typical behavior for optional dependency enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe version checks and raises informative errors if dependencies are missing, aligning with typical package support practices.",
