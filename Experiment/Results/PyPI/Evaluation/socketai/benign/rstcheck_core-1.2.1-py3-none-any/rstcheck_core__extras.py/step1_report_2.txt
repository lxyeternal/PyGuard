  "purpose": "Provides checks and guards for optional dependencies ('sphinx' and 'tomli') to ensure they are installed with supported versions before use.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, importlib.metadata.version, configuration of dependency info, installed status variables",
  "sinks": "install_guard functions raising ModuleNotFoundError with detailed messages",
  "flows": "Code imports modules, checks for their presence and version, then raises errors if requirements are not met",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of standard importlib functions and straightforward version checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency checks for optional Python packages, ensuring they are installed and meet minimum version requirements. It raises informative errors if dependencies are missing or outdated. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious actions are present. All functions serve to enforce dependency requirements in a controlled and explicit manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dependency guard module with no malicious intent. It performs dependency verification and raises errors if requirements are not met. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
