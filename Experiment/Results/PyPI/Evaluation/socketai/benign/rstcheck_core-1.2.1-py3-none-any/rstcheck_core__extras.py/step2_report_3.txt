  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code manages optional dependencies, performs version checks, and raises ModuleNotFoundError if dependencies are missing or unsupported.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior. Uses standard importlib functions and clear error messages.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard dependency management with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dependency checks and error raising.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — The slight securityRisk score is justified as a precaution due to error message exposure, but not indicating actual malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code's behavior. The securityRisk is minor and acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Standard dependency checks, version verification, error raising.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical dependency guard, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency verification with detailed flow analysis.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard dependency checks, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, typical error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — minor, justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), justified by the potential for error message leakage or dependency issues, but not indicating actual security risks.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The dependency management code is standard, safe, and well-structured.\n- No modifications needed for the scores; they are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The detailed error messages could, in theory, leak dependency info, but this is a common and acceptable practice, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\nThis reflects that the code is benign, straightforward, and carries minimal security considerations primarily related to error message exposure, which is typical and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard dependency checker and guard module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
