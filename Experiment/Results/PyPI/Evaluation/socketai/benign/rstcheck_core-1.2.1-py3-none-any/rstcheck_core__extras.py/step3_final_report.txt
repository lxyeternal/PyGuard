{
  "purpose": "Manage optional dependencies, check their installation status and versions, and provide guard functions to enforce their presence with supported versions.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, importlib.metadata.version, the variables SPHINX_INSTALLED, TOMLI_INSTALLED, and the functions install_guard and install_guard_tomli.",
  "sinks": "Raises ModuleNotFoundError with detailed messages when dependencies are missing or unsupported.",
  "flows": "Source: Dependency check functions (is_installed_with_supported_version) determine installation and version; sink: install_guard functions raise exceptions if dependencies are not met.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or obfuscation detected; standard dependency management logic. Slight potential for info leakage via error messages, but this is typical and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward dependency checks for 'sphinx' and 'tomli', verifying minimum versions and raising informative errors if requirements are unmet. It uses importlib to import modules and importlib.metadata to get version info. The guard functions enforce dependency presence, raising ModuleNotFoundError with helpful messages. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present. The minor security risk score (0.1) in some reports reflects the potential for error message info leakage, which is a common aspect of such utility code. Overall, the code is well-structured, clear, and performs its intended purpose without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe dependency management utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk is justified by the potential for error message leakage, which is typical in dependency guards. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
