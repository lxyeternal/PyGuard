{
  "purpose": "Provide a centralized mechanism to check for the presence and supported versions of optional dependencies ('sphinx' and 'tomli') and enforce their installation if needed.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module(), importlib.metadata.version(), importlib.import_module() again in is_installed_with_supported_version().",
  "sinks": "None. No data is sent over the network, written to files, or used in unsafe commands.",
  "flows": "The code checks if dependencies are installed and meet version requirements; install_guard functions raise exceptions if dependencies are missing or outdated.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present. Use of version parsing is straightforward. The code mainly performs dependency checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard dependency checker for optional packages, verifying installation and version requirements using importlib and importlib.metadata. The functions raise ModuleNotFoundError with informative messages if dependencies are missing or outdated. The code includes constants indicating the installation status of dependencies, and the 'install_guard' functions enforce the presence of required dependencies before proceeding. No malicious patterns such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code structure is clear and intended solely for dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a safe dependency management utility without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs version checks and raises errors if dependencies are not met, which is standard practice for such modules.",
