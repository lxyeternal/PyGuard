  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a dependency guard utility for optional dependencies, with version checks and error raising. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. This is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard dependency management. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes dependency checks for 'sphinx' and 'tomli'. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The slight securityRisk score reflects the potential for error messages to leak info, but this is standard for dependency guards.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The small securityRisk score is acceptable, considering error messages could reveal dependency info if misused, but this is typical and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates dependency checks, with no suspicious behavior. The code is standard for such utility modules.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The absence of malicious behavior is confirmed.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency verification logic, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. The potential sink (error messages) is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The small securityRisk score (0) is justified.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard dependency management with no malicious behavior. Slight securityRisk=0.1 is noted, which is acceptable given the context.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The small score is justified, considering error messages could leak info but this is typical.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and functions as described.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Very low. The only minor concern is that error messages could potentially leak dependency info if misused, but this is standard for dependency guards and not malicious.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports. The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- The **obfuscated score** should remain at **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- The **securityRisk** score could be slightly increased to **0.1** in some reports, reflecting the minor potential for info leakage via error messages, but given the context, this is acceptable and standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent.\n- **SecurityRisk:** **0.1** — minimal, due to error message info leakage potential, but not a real security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented dependency guard utility with no malware or malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate, with only a tiny security risk that is inherent to dependency checks and not indicative of malicious activity.",
