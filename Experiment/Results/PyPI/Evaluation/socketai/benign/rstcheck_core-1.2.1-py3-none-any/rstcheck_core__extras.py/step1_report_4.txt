{
  "purpose": "This code manages optional dependency checks for 'extras' dependencies like 'sphinx' and 'tomli', providing functions to verify their installation status and enforce their presence when needed.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the parameters of functions, specifically 'package' in 'is_installed_with_supported_version' and 'install_guard', as well as 'tomllib_imported' in 'install_guard_tomli'. It also reads version info from imported modules using 'importlib.metadata.version'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include raising 'ModuleNotFoundError' with detailed messages that could potentially leak internal package dependency info if misused. No other data leaks or insecure behaviors are present.",
  "flows": "The flow begins with checking if dependencies are installed and supported; if not, functions raise exceptions to prevent further execution that relies on these packages. The version check flow involves retrieving module versions and comparing to minimum required versions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns; all code performs straightforward dependency checking and exception raising. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a dependency management utility that verifies the presence and minimum supported versions of optional dependencies 'sphinx' and 'tomli'. It uses 'importlib' to attempt module imports, retrieves version info via 'importlib.metadata.version', and compares with predefined minimum versions. Functions enforce dependency presence by raising exceptions with helpful messages. No suspicious or malicious activities are present, and no obfuscation is detected. The code operates within expected bounds for dependency checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate dependency verification functions without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It includes standard practices for optional dependency management and error reporting, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
