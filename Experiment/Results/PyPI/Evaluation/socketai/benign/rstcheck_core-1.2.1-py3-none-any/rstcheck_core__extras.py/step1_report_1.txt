  "purpose": "This code manages optional dependencies ('extras') for a Python project, providing functions to check their installation status and enforce their presence when needed.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, importlib.metadata.version, and the dictionaries ExtraDependenciesInfos and ExtraDependenciesInstalled for dependency data.",
  "sinks": "The code raises ModuleNotFoundError with detailed messages if dependencies are missing, which could be misused if error messages are exploited, but this is typical behavior and not malicious.",
  "flows": "Checks for dependency installation and versions via is_installed_with_supported_version; install_guard and install_guard_tomli enforce dependency presence before proceeding with dependent code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The code performs standard dependency management tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script defines dependency info and checks for their installation and versions. It raises informative errors if dependencies are missing or unsupported, which is standard practice. There are no obfuscated parts, no dynamic code execution beyond standard importlib usage, and no hidden or malicious code. The error messages are clear and targeted at guiding the user to install the necessary extras.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dependency management utility for optional Python dependencies. It does not contain malware or malicious intent, and performs standard checks and error handling. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies indicating security risks.",
