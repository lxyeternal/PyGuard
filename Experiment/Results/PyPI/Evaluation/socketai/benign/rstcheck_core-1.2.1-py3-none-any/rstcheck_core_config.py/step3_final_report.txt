{
  "purpose": "This code provides functionality to load, validate, and merge configuration files for rstcheck, supporting INI and TOML formats, with directory traversal capabilities.",
  "sources": "File reading operations (open, resolve, is_file, is_dir), configuration parsing (configparser, tomllib), environment checks, and path manipulations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to data exfiltration, network activity, or code execution are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration files are read from specified paths, validated via pydantic models, and merged into a unified configuration object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices without any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe file handling with path resolution and existence checks, employs pydantic for data validation, and supports multiple configuration formats with proper error handling. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Validation ensures only expected data types are accepted, and directory traversal is performed securely. Overall, the code is a benign configuration management utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard configuration loader with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It employs safe practices and standard libraries, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
