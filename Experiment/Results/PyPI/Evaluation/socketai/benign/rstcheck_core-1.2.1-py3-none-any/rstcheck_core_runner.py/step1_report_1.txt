{
  "purpose": "Main runner class for executing and managing rstcheck_core's file checking process, including configuration, file discovery, and result reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, file paths for rst files, and potentially environment settings for multiprocessing.",
  "sinks": "Outputs error messages to stdout or stderr; loads configuration files from specified paths.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from files into the main config; file paths flow through filtering and directory walk; error messages flow from check results to output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual dynamic code execution; no obfuscated code detected; standard use of multiprocessing and file I/O; no suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file discovery, configuration merging, and parallel or synchronous checking of files for lint errors. It handles nonexisting paths and directory traversal securely. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity, are present. Use of multiprocessing is standard for performance. All data flows are predictable, and no dangerous code injections or obfuscations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a file checking runner with configuration handling and parallel processing. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage behaviors. No indicators of malware or security risks are detected.",
