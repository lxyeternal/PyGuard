{
  "purpose": "Main runner for the rstcheck_core module, orchestrating file checks, configuration loading, and output reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, input file paths, and environment variables; uses standard library functions for file system access and multiprocessing.",
  "sinks": "Outputs error messages to stdout/stderr; loads configuration files; accesses system environment via sys.platform; performs directory walking and file filtering.",
  "flows": "Loads config -> filters file paths -> checks files synchronously or in parallel -> collects errors -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. The code uses standard modules and patterns. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical file processing and reporting utility with configuration handling and parallel processing support. It securely filters and checks files without evident malicious logic. No indications of data leakage, unauthorized network activity, or malicious modifications. No malicious payloads or covert channels detected. It operates mainly with filesystem paths, configuration files, and standard output, with no external network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign, well-structured utility for running and reporting on rst file checks. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It relies on standard libraries and common patterns without suspicious behaviors.",
