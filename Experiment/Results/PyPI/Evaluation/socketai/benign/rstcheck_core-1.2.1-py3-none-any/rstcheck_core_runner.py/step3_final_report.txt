  "purpose": "Main runner for rstcheck_core, managing configuration, file discovery, and error reporting.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths, configuration files, standard input (stdin).",
  "sinks": "Error message output to stderr or specified output file.",
  "flows": "Configuration loading → File path filtering → Directory traversal and file collection → Parallel or synchronous file checks → Error collection → Output printing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured utility for managing configuration, discovering rst files, and performing checks in parallel or sync. It uses standard modules and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The file filtering and directory traversal are typical, and error handling is straightforward. No external network activity or secret handling is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a file checking runner with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
