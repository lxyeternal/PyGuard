  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is a standard, auto-generated versioning snippet created by setuptools_scm.\n   - The code performs static assignments of version strings and tuples.\n   - It uses a conditional import for type hinting, which is a common pattern.\n   - There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Obfuscation**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or hidden logic.\n   - Malware score of 0 across all reports aligns with this.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Vulnerabilities**:\n   - Since the code only manages version info with static data, the security risk is negligible.\n   - No external data handling, no code injection points, and no runtime logic that could be exploited.\n   - All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n4. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - The reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n5. **Any discrepancies or overestimations?**\n   - No. The scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1, which is justified.\n\n6. **Potential for higher scores?**\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements, raising scores would be unwarranted.\n   - The only caveat might be if the code were part of a larger, malicious package, but based solely on this snippet, the assessment is correct.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimates align with the reports.** The code is standard, benign, and poses no security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated code present. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
