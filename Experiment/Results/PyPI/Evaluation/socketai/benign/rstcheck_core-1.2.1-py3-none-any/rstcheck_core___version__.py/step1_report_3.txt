{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage and track package version details.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ and version), the tuple definitions (__version_tuple__ and version_tuple), and the TYPE_CHECKING conditional import.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly leads untrusted data to sensitive sinks; no external data handling or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code simply assigns static version values to variables; there are no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains conditional type hinting constructs, but these are standard for type checking and do not exhibit unusual or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, auto-generated for version management, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or external interactions. It primarily sets static version data. The presence of type hinting conditioned on TYPE_CHECKING is standard practice and not malicious. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated version information script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages package version data.",
