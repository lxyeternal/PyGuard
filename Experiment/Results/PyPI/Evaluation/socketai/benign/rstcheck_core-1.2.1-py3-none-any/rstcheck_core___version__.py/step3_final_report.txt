  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, auto-generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string and tuple, conditional type checking import.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignments with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, auto-generated code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static version declaration snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It uses conditional type checking to define version tuples, with all variables assigned fixed, hardcoded values. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is solely to store version info, which is a common and benign pattern. The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the code's clarity. The security risk score is 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious constructs. The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's nature, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static version info with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as standard boilerplate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or revision is needed.",
