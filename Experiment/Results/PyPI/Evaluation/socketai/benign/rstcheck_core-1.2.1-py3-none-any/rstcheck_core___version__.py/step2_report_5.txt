  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the associated code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a standard, auto-generated version declaration snippet for a Python package.\n   - It assigns static version strings and tuples, with conditional type hinting.\n   - There are no dynamic elements, external inputs, or external data processing.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - The analysis is thorough, correctly identifying the code as boilerplate generated by setuptools_scm.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Since the code is straightforward and benign, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity is detected or suggested.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify the code as boilerplate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Summary & Personal Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, auto-generated versioning module with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- No changes needed; the assessment is consistent and justified.",
