  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, used for managing package versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "N/A - straightforward variable assignments without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional type checking; no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden functionality. The code is standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables, including version string and tuple, based on static assignments. The use of TYPE_CHECKING and conditional import from 'typing' is standard for type hints. No input, no external data handling, and no suspicious code behavior are present. The code does not include any network operations, file manipulations, or other potentially malicious activities. It appears to be a benign, auto-generated versioning snippet from setuptools_scm.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
