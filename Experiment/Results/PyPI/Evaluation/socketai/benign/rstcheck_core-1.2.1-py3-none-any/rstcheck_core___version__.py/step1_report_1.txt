  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "N/A, as no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard version declaration code.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines a version tuple based on type checking, then assigns version strings and tuples with static values. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The code is typical for package version management, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard version declaration boilerplate generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and poses no security risks.",
