{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, without performing any runtime logic or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and type annotations; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; the code only sets variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for version definition.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes versioning metadata using static variables, including __version__ and version tuples. It conditionally imports type hints under a TYPE_CHECKING block, which is standard practice. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network activity, or runtime logic that could be exploited. The code does not contain any malicious constructs, backdoors, or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, auto-generated versioning code with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely sets version variables statically without any external dependencies or suspicious behavior.",
