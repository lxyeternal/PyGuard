  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, consistency of scores, and potential issues.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily type definitions, data structures, and a simple utility function.\n- No external data, untrusted inputs, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code does not perform I/O, network operations, or any security-sensitive actions.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward and benign.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign obfuscated scores of 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Scores consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0), which is justified given the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are evident in the reports. They correctly interpret the code as benign and non-malicious.\n\n### Potential claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about hidden behavior, which is appropriate.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Risk scores:** Should remain at 0.0 given the benign nature.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Confidence:** Should stay high, as the analysis is thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed reviews, the code is a simple, well-structured set of type definitions and a utility function with no security concerns.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign utility module for a linting or static analysis tool, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All scores should reflect this, remaining at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk, with high confidence.",
