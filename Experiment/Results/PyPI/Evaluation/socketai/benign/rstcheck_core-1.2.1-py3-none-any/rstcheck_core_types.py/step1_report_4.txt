{
  "purpose": "This code defines types, data structures, and utility functions for a Python linter or code analysis tool, specifically related to handling source files, lint errors, ignore directives, and inline configurations.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data such as file paths, strings, and patterns; no external input sources or untrusted data streams are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks exist that handle untrusted data; the code does not process or execute external input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the functions are primarily for data structure construction and static analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns are present. The code strictly defines types and helper functions without any dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type aliases, TypedDicts, and a simple constructor function. It does not perform any file I/O, network communication, command execution, or dynamic data handling. The functions and classes are standard and serve as data containers for a static analysis or linter tool. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated code is present. The code appears to be well-structured, straightforward, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data type definitions and helper functions for a Python linter framework. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data processing, and no security risks. It is safe and purely structural.",
