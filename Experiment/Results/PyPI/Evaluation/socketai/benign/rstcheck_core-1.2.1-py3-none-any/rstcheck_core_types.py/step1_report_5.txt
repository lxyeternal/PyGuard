{
  "purpose": "Define types and helper functions for linting and configuration in a Python code analysis tool.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines types, classes, and a helper function, with no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs, network calls, or other side effects involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is purely structural and definitional.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; all constructs are standard typing and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type definitions using Python typing module, class definitions for structured data (LintError, IgnoreDict, InlineConfig, InlineFlowControl), and a simple constructor function for IgnoreDict. There are no data inputs, no processing of untrusted data, and no code execution beyond object creation. The code appears to serve as scaffolding for a larger linting framework. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining data types and a helper function for creating IgnoreDict instances. It contains no suspicious or malicious activity and does not introduce security risks.",
