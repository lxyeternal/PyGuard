  "purpose": "Define helper types, data structures, and utility functions for a linting or code analysis tool.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines types, classes, and a function for constructing dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of type definitions, simple data container classes, and a utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several type aliases, TypedDict classes, and a helper function for creating IgnoreDict objects. It uses standard Python typing features and imports only standard modules. No external inputs, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code injections. The code appears to be straightforward utility code for a static analysis or linting tool, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. Overall, the code is benign and focused on data structure definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module defining data types and a helper function for managing ignore configurations. No malicious or security risks are present.",
