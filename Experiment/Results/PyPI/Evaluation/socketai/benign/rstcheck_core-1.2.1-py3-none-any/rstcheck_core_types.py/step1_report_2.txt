{
  "purpose": "This code defines types and utility functions for a Python linter or code analysis tool, specifically for handling source files, lint errors, ignore configurations, and inline configuration parsing.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read within this code. It solely defines data structures and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks exist that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code. The code does not perform any I/O, network, or command execution.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code only defines types and a simple constructor function for configuration dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious, unusual, or malicious patterns. The code uses standard Python features and type annotations for data structure definitions. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions and a utility function for managing ignore configurations within a linter or analysis tool. All functions and classes are standard and straightforward, with no dynamic execution, external calls, or data handling that could indicate malicious behavior. The construct_ignore_dict function safely creates configuration dictionaries with default values. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely consists of type definitions and a utility function for configuration management within a linter framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.",
