  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine whether the conclusions are justified and whether the scores align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code defines type aliases, TypedDict classes, and a utility function for constructing ignore configuration dictionaries.\n- It uses standard Python modules and features.\n- There are no external inputs, no data processing, no file or network operations.\n- No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no security-sensitive operations.\n- The code is purely structural, serving as scaffolding for a linter or static analysis tool.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and does not contain vulnerabilities, malicious code, or errors.\n\n### Logical/Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code appears correct, with proper type annotations, default handling, and documentation.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, which is justified. No malicious behavior is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, which is accurate. The code is clear and readable.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional and contains no security risks or malicious logic.\n- No claims are based on unfounded assumptions; the analysis is accurate.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and match the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** (benign, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** (no security risks or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely structural with no external data handling or execution, there's no reason to assign any higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The code is safe, benign, and purely for type definitions and configuration management.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.0.",
