{
  "purpose": "Defines types and helper functions for a Python linter tool, including error reporting, ignore rules, and inline configuration handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (__future__, pathlib, typing) and internal function parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (parameters) flow into functions to create data structures, but no dangerous or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be straightforward type and configuration definitions without external data processing or security-sensitive operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines type aliases, TypedDict classes, and a constructor function for default ignore rule dictionaries. It imports standard modules and uses type annotations to facilitate static analysis and tooling. There are no network operations, file manipulations, or security-critical functions. The structure and logic are simple, with no obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard helper module for a linter system, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or malware. It is safe and appears to serve purely as type definitions and utility functions.",
