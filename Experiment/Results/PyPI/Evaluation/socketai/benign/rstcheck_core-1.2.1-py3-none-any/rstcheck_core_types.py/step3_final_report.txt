  "purpose": "Type definitions and a helper function for managing ignore configurations in a Python linting or static analysis framework.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is static and does not process data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, using standard Python typing and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases, TypedDict classes, and a utility function for constructing ignore configuration dictionaries. It relies solely on standard Python modules and typing features, with no external inputs, data processing, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. The function safely handles optional parameters, defaulting to empty lists. Overall, the code is purely structural, serving as scaffolding for a linter or static analysis tool, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and purely structural, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are appropriate and should remain at 0.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
