  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package for 'django-rest-framework'.",
  "sources": "No user input or untrusted data sources; static package configuration.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks; the script only performs package setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static metadata for packaging a Python project. All fields are hardcoded with no dynamic execution, user input, or external data fetching. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The package's intent appears to be the distribution of 'django-rest-framework', with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
