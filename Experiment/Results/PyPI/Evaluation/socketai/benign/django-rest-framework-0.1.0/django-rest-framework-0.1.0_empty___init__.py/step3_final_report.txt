  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, file/network operations, potential data sinks such as network or file writes.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system writes, system commands, environment variables, user inputs.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), potentially via unvalidated data flows leading to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, incomplete snippets, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports describe either empty or incomplete code with no executable statements or malicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0) are consistent with the lack of suspicious features. Security risk scores are low (0.2-0.3), reflecting cautious estimates due to incomplete information. Confidence levels vary from 0.2 to 0.8, appropriately indicating uncertainty. No anomalies or red flags are identified. The overall assessment indicates minimal threat, aligning with the benign descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets analyzed show no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the findings. Given the incomplete or empty code, a conservative security risk score of 0.1 is recommended for all reports to reflect minimal concern. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
