  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a custom SQLAlchemy dialect for Databricks, mainly performing metadata retrieval (tables, columns).\n- It uses URL parameters for connection setup, executes standard queries ('SHOW TABLES'), and processes results.\n- The regex used is simple, extracting the first word from column type strings.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- No user input is directly executed as code; queries are static or based on URL parameters.\n- The only potential minor concern is the unverified regex match, but it’s used on database output, not user input.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states the code's function.\n- **Analysis:** Finds no malicious activity, mentions the regex could cause exceptions if no match, but this is a minor point.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0. Overall reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Notes regex is benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Repeats the same, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Emphasizes safe handling, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Similar findings, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-checking with the code:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code’s purpose and no malicious activity, these are reasonable. The highest is 0.2, which is still low.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard, straightforward implementation of a database dialect.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The regex usage is safe, operating on database output, not user input.\n- Connection parameters are derived from URL, which is standard.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to regex on database output, which is safe but could be improved with match verification)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                     |\n| Risk            | 0.1                   |\n\nThe code appears secure, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain risk. The minor risk is negligible and mainly related to unverified regex matching, which is unlikely to cause issues in a controlled environment.\n\n**Note:** For best practice, adding a check for regex match existence would be advisable, but it does not change the security assessment.",
