{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom SQLAlchemy dialect for connecting to Databricks, providing methods to retrieve table and column information.",
  "sources": "URL attributes (host, password, database), connection.execute() queries, regex on col_type",
  "sinks": "connection.execute() results, regex matching on col_type, util.warn message",
  "flows": "URL attributes -> create_connect_args; connection.execute() -> get_table_names/get_columns; regex -> type processing; warn message on unrecognized type",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution; no network or file system operations; standard usage of third-party libraries",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom SQLAlchemy dialect for Databricks, overriding methods to adapt table and column retrieval. Data flow mainly involves URL parameters and database query results. The regex is used to parse column types, with a fallback warning on unrecognized types. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The use of 'connection.execute()' is standard for database interactions. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected; the code appears to serve its purpose for database schema inspection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a custom database dialect for Databricks, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard operations for schema introspection and does not include malicious or suspicious activities.",
