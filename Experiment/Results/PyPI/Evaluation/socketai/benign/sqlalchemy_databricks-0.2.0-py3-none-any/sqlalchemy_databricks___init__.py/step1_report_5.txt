  "purpose": "Import a dialect class from a local module and define the package version",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._dialect",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external output present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no flow present",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with straightforward import and version declaration; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and sets a version string. There are no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The import is from a relative module, which is typical for package internal structure. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no network activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup with an import and version declaration. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
