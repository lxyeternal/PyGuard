  "purpose": "This code imports a local module '_dialect' and assigns a version string, serving as part of a package's internal structure.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '_dialect', static version string assignment",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "Import from local module (source) with no data flow to external sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal, straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement and version declaration, typical for package modules. It involves no user input, network activity, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and standard structure suggest it is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected, and the code does not perform any risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
