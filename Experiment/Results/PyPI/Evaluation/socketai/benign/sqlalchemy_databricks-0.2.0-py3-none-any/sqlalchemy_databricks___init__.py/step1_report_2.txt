{
  "purpose": "The code imports a dialect class for Databricks and defines a version string, likely part of a larger library or package related to database connectivity or dialect handling.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' is a static assignment; the import statement reads from a local module '_dialect'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class from a local module and assigns a version string; there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and a version declaration. No user input, network activity, or data processing occurs. The imported module is local ('._dialect'), which suggests internal code organization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
