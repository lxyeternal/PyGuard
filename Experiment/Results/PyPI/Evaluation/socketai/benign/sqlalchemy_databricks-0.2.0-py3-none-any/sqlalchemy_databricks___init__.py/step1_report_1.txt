  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module related to database dialects and sets a version string. There are no user inputs, network calls, or data processing. The import is from a local relative module, which is common in package code. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module import and version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
