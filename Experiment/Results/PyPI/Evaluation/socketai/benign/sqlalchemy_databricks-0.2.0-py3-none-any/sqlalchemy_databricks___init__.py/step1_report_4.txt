  "purpose": "Import a specific dialect module and define the package version",
  "sources": "Import statement importing _dialect module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "None identified; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; straightforward import and version declaration, no hidden or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module '_dialect' and assigns a version string to __version__. There are no user inputs, network operations, or data processing. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The import appears to be a standard practice for extending or configuring dialects in a package. The version string is hardcoded and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module import and version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
