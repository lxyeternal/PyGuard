  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement from a local module `_dialect` and a version string assignment.\n   - There are no user inputs, network calls, or data processing.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for a package or library setup.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**:\n   - No report finds any obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or signs of malicious intent.\n   - The code does not perform any external communication, data handling, or dynamic execution.\n   - The import from a local module `_dialect` is standard for internal package structure.\n\n3. **Security Risks**:\n   - All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code segments are present.\n\n4. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores**:\n   - All reports give malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The code is transparent, with no hidden or malicious logic.\n\n5. **Scores Justification**:\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable given the code snippet.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes to the scores are warranted.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code snippet appears to be a standard, safe module import and version declaration, typical in package code.",
