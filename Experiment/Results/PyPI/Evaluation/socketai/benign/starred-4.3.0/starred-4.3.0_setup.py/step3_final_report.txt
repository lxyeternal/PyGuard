  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and CLI documentation.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependency list, CLI entry points, and documentation strings; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications; no untrusted data processed within this script.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code present; CLI options include sensitive parameters but are standard and handled at runtime in the package code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or embedded secrets are detected. The presence of CLI options with '--token' and '--username' suggests sensitive data is handled during runtime, not in this script. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident in the setup configuration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The handling of sensitive data occurs at runtime within the main package code, not in setup.py. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2) is justified. All reports are accurate and consistent.",
