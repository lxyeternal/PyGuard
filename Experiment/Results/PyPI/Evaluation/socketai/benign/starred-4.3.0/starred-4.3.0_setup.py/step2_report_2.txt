  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. No untrusted data processing or code execution is present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, mainly because it's a setup script with no active security issues.\n- **Comments:** The report is accurate. The code is static, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a benign setup file. The only sensitive element is the placeholder for a GitHub token, which is user-supplied at runtime.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, as it involves user-supplied tokens but no embedded secrets or malicious code.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound. The presence of placeholders does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:** Maintain current scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup configuration with no malicious code or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with a benign setup script.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no evident risks.\n- **Comments:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep scores unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The setup script defines CLI options like `--token` and `--username`. These are user inputs, likely used in the main package code for GitHub API interactions.\n- **Potential concern:** The CLI options accept sensitive data, but no malicious code is present here.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — handling of tokens at runtime is standard; no embedded secrets.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning correctly distinguishes between setup configuration and runtime behavior. The presence of CLI options with sensitive parameters does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with CLI options for tokens and usernames. No malicious code is present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — similar reasoning as above.\n- **Comments:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n**Recommendation:** Maintain current scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0; no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2) due to handling of user-supplied tokens, but this is standard practice for CLI tools interacting with APIs, not a security risk per se.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and static.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily due to user-provided tokens, which is typical and not inherently risky.\n\nThe code appears entirely benign, serving as a setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The handling of tokens and user inputs is typical for CLI tools interacting with external APIs. No changes to the existing scores are necessary.",
