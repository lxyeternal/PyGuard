  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The handling of sensitive data occurs at runtime within the main package code, not in setup.py. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2) is justified. All reports are accurate and consistent."
