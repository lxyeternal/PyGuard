  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API client for retrieving starred repositories from GitHub. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard API interaction with external token handling. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
