The handling of sensitive data occurs at runtime within the main package code, not in setup.py. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2) is justified. All reports are accurate and consistent."

The current malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard API interaction with external token handling. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
