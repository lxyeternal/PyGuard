{
  "purpose": "The code defines a version string, likely for a software package or module.",
  "sources": "The only source is the assignment of a string to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is being sent, stored insecurely, or used in a malicious manner.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code merely assigns a static value.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a version string to a variable. It does not read external input, perform any operations, or invoke functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The simplicity indicates it is likely a normal version identifier for a package or module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
