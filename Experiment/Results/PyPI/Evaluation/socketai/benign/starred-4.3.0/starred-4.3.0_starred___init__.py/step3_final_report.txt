  "purpose": "Assign a static version string to a variable for version tracking.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a direct assignment of a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows, inputs, or outputs.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a static assignment: VERSION = '4.3.0'. There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code is a common pattern for version declaration, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, and confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version string assignment with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The current scores accurately reflect its harmless nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
