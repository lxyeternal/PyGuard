  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic**: All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a static string to a variable named `VERSION`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions. This is typical for version declaration snippets.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**: All reports correctly identify that no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious intent are present. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n3. **Obfuscation & Malware Scores**: All reports assign `obfuscated` and `malware` scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Security Risk Scores**: All reports assign a `securityRisk` score of 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns in such a minimal, static assignment.\n\n5. **Confidence Levels**: All reports show high confidence (1.0 or 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n\n- The reports are highly consistent and all conclude that the code is benign. This is reasonable given the code snippet.\n\n- No report suggests any obfuscation or malicious intent, which is correct.\n\n- Since the code is just a static version string, assigning a high security risk or malware score would be unjustified.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risk in such a static assignment.\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports: the code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores reflect this accurately.",
