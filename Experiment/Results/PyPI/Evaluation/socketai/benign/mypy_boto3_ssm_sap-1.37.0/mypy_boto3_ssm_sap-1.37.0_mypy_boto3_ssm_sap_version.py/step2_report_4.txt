  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms the code is a straightforward static assignment of `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"` with no malicious behavior.  \n- No anomalies or obfuscation detected.  \n- Malware score: 0, Risk: 0, Confidence: 1.  \n**Assessment:** Completely benign, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar static assignment, with a note about the future copyright year (2025).  \n- The future date is unusual but not malicious; possibly a typo or oversight.  \n- Malware score: 0, Risk: 0.1 (due to the future date), Confidence: 0.9.  \n**Assessment:** No malicious intent; the future year is an anomaly but not security-threatening.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same static assignment, highlighting the future copyright year as an anomaly.  \n- No suspicious behavior, external data, or obfuscation.  \n- Malware score: 0, Risk: 0, Confidence: 1.  \n**Assessment:** Benign, with the only notable anomaly being the future year.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar to previous, no dynamic code or external data, just a version string and a future copyright year.  \n- No malicious activity.  \n- Malware score: 0, Risk: 0, Confidence: 1.  \n**Assessment:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same as above, no suspicious patterns, just a static version string and a future copyright year.  \n- No malicious behavior.  \n- Malware score: 0, Risk: 0, Confidence: 1.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, and the code is just a static version string. **I agree with a malware score of 0 across all reports.**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward. **Obfuscated score remains 0.**  \n- **Risk Score:** The only potential concern is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it doesn't pose a security risk; it's likely a typo or placeholder. The risk scores assigned (mostly 0 or 0.1) seem appropriate.  \n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately high, given the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.  \n- The future copyright year is an anomaly but not a security concern.  \n- No changes needed to the scores.\n\n### My own estimates:  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk beyond a minor anomaly, which isn't a security issue)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a simple, static version declaration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is unlikely to be malicious but could be corrected for clarity. The current scoring reflects this well.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that such version files are maintained accurately, and future-dated copyrights are corrected to prevent confusion.",
