  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and reasoning, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- There are no input/output operations, no external data handling, and no dynamic or obfuscated code.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or oversight, not malicious.\n- No report indicates any suspicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No, all reports agree that the code is straightforward and benign.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  No significant flaws. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is consistently flagged as an anomaly but not a security concern.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports.  \n  Correct, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports.  \n  Correct, code is plain and readable.\n\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1.  \n  The second report assigns 0.1 due to the future date anomaly.  \n  This seems reasonable; the future date is an anomaly but not a security risk.\n\n- **Confidence levels:** High (0.9 to 1), justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The only questionable point is the future copyright year (2025).  \n  While unusual, it does not imply malicious intent, just a potential typo or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the future date anomaly, but very minor and not security-relevant)\n\n- **Justification for risk score > 0.5?**  \n  Not applicable here; all scores are well below 0.5, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThis code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the future date anomaly, but negligible in security terms)\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the analysis above.",
