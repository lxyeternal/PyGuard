  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow analysis needed as there's only a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future year (2025) suggests a potential typo or inconsistency, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single string assignment to __version__ with a copyright notice. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The comment and variable assignment are standard for version control in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define a version string with a copyright notice. No malicious behavior, no security issues detected.",
