  "purpose": "Define and provide the version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string '__version__' assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "N/A – static assignment of version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple version assignment and a comment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment indicating the source of truth for versioning and a single variable assignment setting __version__ to a static string '1.37.0'. There are no input/output operations, no external data handling, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. The code appears to serve a basic purpose of version tracking, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It provides version info and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
