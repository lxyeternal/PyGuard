{
  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package, serving as the source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__ variable; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment with no dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but likely a typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string with a comment. No dynamic code, external data, or suspicious patterns are present. The only anomaly is the future year, which does not pose a security risk. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign malware scores of 0. The minor anomaly (future date) is noted but does not impact security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static version identifier. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is unlikely to be malicious or security-relevant.",
