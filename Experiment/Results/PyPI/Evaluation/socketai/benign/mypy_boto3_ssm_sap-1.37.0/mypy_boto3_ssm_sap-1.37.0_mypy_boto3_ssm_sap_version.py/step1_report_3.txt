  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The comment claims a copyright date of 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming October 2023), indicating a potential inconsistency or typographical error.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to __version__ and includes a comment about the source of truth and copyright. There are no dynamic or malicious elements, no external data handling, and no suspicious behaviors. The only notable aspect is the future copyright year, which is likely an oversight or typo but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a metadata declaration for the package's version. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely an error.",
