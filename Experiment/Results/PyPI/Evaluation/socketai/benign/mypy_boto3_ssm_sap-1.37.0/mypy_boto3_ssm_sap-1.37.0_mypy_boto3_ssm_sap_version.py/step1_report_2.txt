  "purpose": "Define and expose the version number of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable with a string literal.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "The version string is statically assigned; no data flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright notice with a future date (2025), which is unusual and potentially suspicious. Otherwise, no anomalies or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a static string to __version__, serving as a version identifier. The presence of a copyright notice with a future year (2025) may suggest oversight or intentional obfuscation but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external communications, or dynamic code execution. Overall, the code is straightforward and lacks suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with an unusual future copyright year but no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It appears benign with minimal security risk.",
