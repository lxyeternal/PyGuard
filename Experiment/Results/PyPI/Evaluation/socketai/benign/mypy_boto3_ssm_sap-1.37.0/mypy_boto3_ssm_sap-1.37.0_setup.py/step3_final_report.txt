  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-ssm-sap package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static data used in setup() call; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that imports Path and setuptools.setup(), reads a local README.md for description, and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, code obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All data is hardcoded or read from trusted local files, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no security risks or malicious intent. All previous reports correctly identified the code as safe, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0.0. The code's static and transparent nature justifies these scores. No modifications are necessary.",
