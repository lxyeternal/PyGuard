  "purpose": "This script is for setting up and configuring the Python package 'mypy-boto3-ssm-sap' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and imports setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads local file for description, then passes static configuration data to setup() function; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code appears straightforward for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path and setup, reads a local README.md for description, and calls setup() with static metadata. All data is hardcoded or read from trusted local files. No dynamic code execution, no untrusted input handling, and no suspicious network or file operations. The code follows standard setup procedures with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard, static, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It securely defines package metadata without any indications of malicious behavior.",
