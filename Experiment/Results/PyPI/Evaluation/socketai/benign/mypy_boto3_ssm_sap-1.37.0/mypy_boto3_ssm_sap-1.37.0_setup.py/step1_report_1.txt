{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package called mypy-boto3-ssm-sap, used to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The script reads the README.md file for long description; all other data appears to be hardcoded within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data processing present; no network, file, or system modifications are performed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the script primarily loads static data and calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Path' from pathlib to read a local README file for the long description, then uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. All data appears static, with no user input, environment variable, or external data involved. No obfuscated code, malicious constructs, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The dependencies and URLs seem legitimate for a package meant for type annotations related to boto3.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for a Python project.",
