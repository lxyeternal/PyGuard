  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-ssm-sap package, used to configure and install the package with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; no untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() to define installation parameters; no sinks for untrusted data or malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> passes static metadata to setup() -> installation process; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code appears to be a standard setup script with well-defined structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pathlib and setuptools, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata. No input/output streams, network operations, or dynamic code execution observed. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely configures package installation parameters.",
