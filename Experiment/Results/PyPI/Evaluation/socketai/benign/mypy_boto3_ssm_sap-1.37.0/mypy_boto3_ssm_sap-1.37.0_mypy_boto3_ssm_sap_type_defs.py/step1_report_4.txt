{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the ssm-sap service in Python, facilitating type-safe interactions with AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys.version_info checks for conditional imports, and the type definitions themselves (e.g., TypedDict classes).",
  "sinks": "No execution or data handling code; only type definitions. No runtime sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "The code establishes data structures (TypedDicts, Literals) used elsewhere; no data flows or execution paths are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward type annotations and documentation, with no suspicious code or behavior. The inclusion of a copyright date in 2025 is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, conditional imports based on Python version, and extensive TypedDict class definitions for structured data. No dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The code is purely declarative, aimed at providing type hints and documentation for a Python SDK. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or external communications are found. The initial comment block includes a copyright date in 2025, which is future-dated but not harmful. The import patterns and type definitions are standard for typed Python modules. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type definition module for AWS SDK interactions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, focusing solely on data schemas and documentation, with no runtime or harmful elements.",
