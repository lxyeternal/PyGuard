  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the assessments are accurate and consistent with the code, and then synthesize an overall security stance.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static set of type annotations using TypedDict, Literal, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- There are no functions, no runtime logic, no data processing, and no external system interactions.\n- The code appears to serve as a type definition and documentation layer for an AWS SDK related to the ssm-sap service.\n- No dynamic code, code injection, or handling of untrusted data is present.\n- The only potentially \"suspicious\" element is the comment with a future-dated copyright year (2025), which is benign and standard in documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is static, no sinks, flows, anomalies, or malicious behavior.\n- Correctly identifies the code as purely type annotations.\n- Security risk: **negligible (0)**.\n- Malware: **0**.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the static nature and lack of external data handling.\n- Correctly notes no malicious intent.\n- Security risk: **negligible (0)**.\n- Malware: **0**.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also aligns with the previous assessments.\n- Highlights the absence of runtime execution, external communication, or credential handling.\n- Notes the copyright year as unusual but not malicious.\n- Security risk: **negligible (0)**.\n- Malware: **0**.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusions: static, purely declarative, no malicious code.\n- Mentions the future date as unusual but harmless.\n- Security risk: **negligible (0)**.\n- Malware: **0**.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with others: no runtime logic, no untrusted data handling.\n- Focuses on the purpose of the code as a static type definition.\n- Security risk: **negligible (0)**.\n- Malware: **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?** No. All reports agree that the code is purely static type annotations.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns?** No. The code is straightforward, with conditional imports for compatibility, which is standard practice.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** None. The code does not process data, handle secrets, or execute logic.\n- **Malware score justification:** Zero, as there is no malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as the code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Zero, given the static, documentation-oriented nature.\n\n### **Overall Security Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS SDK interactions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements are present.\n- The only unusual element is the future copyright date (2025), which is benign.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious activity or code.                                                                   |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Clear, straightforward type definitions.                                                          |\n| Security Risk   | 0                 | Static type annotations with no runtime or external data handling.                              |\n\n**In conclusion, the code poses no security threat and should be considered safe.**",
