  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for ssm-sap service API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, type definitions, and class declarations; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static type annotations and data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code uses conditional imports for compatibility and standard type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type definitions for structured data used in AWS SDK interactions, including TypedDict classes for request/response structures, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or credential handling. The only potentially sensitive info could be the 'Copyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov' line, but it is a comment and not executable. The code appears to be purely declarative, with no malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS service definitions, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
