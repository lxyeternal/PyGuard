  "purpose": "Type annotations for ssm-sap service type definitions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data only through static class definitions, type hints, and conditional imports; no runtime data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing occur; the code defines data schemas without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual element is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which is benign and likely a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of type annotations using TypedDict, Literal, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no functions, no runtime logic, no external data handling, and no dynamic code execution. The absence of code injection, secrets, or external system interactions indicates no malicious intent. The use of standard practices suggests the code's purpose is documentation and type safety. The future year '2025' is benign but somewhat unusual. Overall, the code is straightforward, transparent, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured set of type definitions for the AWS ssm-sap SDK, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date, which does not impact security. The overall security assessment is that it poses no threat and is safe for use.",
