  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, purpose, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static set of type annotations and data structures for the ssm-sap service, with no dynamic or runtime code. It uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility and defines TypedDict classes for data modeling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely static, with no data processing, external input handling, or dynamic execution. The absence of any suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation aligns with a low security risk.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both are accurately scored as 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk is negligible (0), consistent with the report.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is sound. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature of type definitions, with no external data handling or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the absence of dynamic code or external interactions. The use of conditional imports and type hints is standard.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Correctly scored as 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Appropriately minimal.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a collection of type definitions for AWS SDK interactions, with no runtime or external data processing.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly highlights the static, declarative nature of the code. The only potentially unusual element is the copyright date \"2025,\" which is future-dated but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both are accurately scored as 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Justified as 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code consists of type annotations and data structures, with no runtime code or external data handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The future date in the copyright comment is noted but not problematic.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Correctly scored as 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Valid as 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—static type definitions for AWS SDK, with no data processing or external interactions.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report accurately describes the code's static, declarative nature, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Properly scored as 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Justified as 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type annotations, data structures, and documentation helpers for the ssm-sap service SDK.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malicious or obfuscated elements are present in the code snippets.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** All are appropriately set to 0, reflecting no security concerns.\n\n- **Potential Anomalies:** The only minor anomaly is the future-dated copyright year \"2025,\" which is not malicious but somewhat unusual.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**, as the code is straightforward and transparent.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Confirmed as **0**, given the static, documentation-oriented nature of the code.\n\n- **Additional Notes:** The future copyright date is benign but noteworthy; it doesn't impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The entire set of reports correctly identifies that this code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations for an AWS SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
