  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports conclude that the code is purely static type annotations and data structure definitions for the ssm-sap service SDK.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or runtime vulnerabilities.\n- The code relies on standard practices, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and extensive TypedDict class definitions.\n- No external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which is not malicious but somewhat unusual.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **No issues detected.** The code is a static set of type annotations and data schemas with no runtime logic or data processing.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **No logical errors or flaws** are evident.\n- The use of `sys.version_info` for conditional imports is standard.\n- The future year \"2025\" in the copyright comment is unusual but not problematic.\n\n### Scores Given and Their Reasonableness:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **Malware score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n  - **Security risk score:** 0\n- These are reasonable given the static, declarative nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0, which is justified.\n- The code contains no runtime execution, external data processing, or dynamic behavior that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n- The code's purpose is purely to define data structures, so the risk of vulnerabilities is minimal.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; all indicate negligible or no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — static type definitions pose no security threat.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not harmful.\n- The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard and safe.\n- No signs of code injection, secret handling, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a benign, static type definition module with no security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0.0**.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
