  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the ssm-sap service using TypedDict for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, and internal literals; type annotations in class definitions; string literals; and module-level constants.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data directly; type annotations and constants are static, and no dynamic execution or data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to critical functions or external systems; mostly static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, such as hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward type annotations and structured definitions. Use of 'sys.version_info' for conditional imports is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and internal literals, conditionally imports typing features based on Python version, and defines multiple TypedDict classes representing various data structures used in the ssm-sap service. There are no functions, no runtime data processing, and no dynamic code execution. All class definitions are static, and string literals are used for type safety. No code injection, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The purpose appears solely to define types and documentation helpers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations and data structures for a Python SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated or suspicious code, and no runtime vulnerabilities. Overall security risk is negligible.",
