  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Static type annotations and data structures for ssm-sap.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime code, no data processing, no external data handling. Uses standard practices like conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** negligible\n- **Conclusion:** Purely static, well-structured type definitions with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and data structures for ssm-sap.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, no dynamic code, no external data handling, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** negligible\n- **Conclusion:** Static type definitions, safe and straightforward.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for AWS SDK interactions.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime or external data processing, only data schemas and type hints. No malicious code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** negligible\n- **Conclusion:** Purely declarative, safe, and standard.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for AWS SSM SAP service.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no data handling, no external interactions. The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** negligible\n- **Conclusion:** Static, well-structured type definitions, no malicious elements.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS SDK.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—static, no runtime code, no external data processing.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** negligible\n- **Conclusion:** Purely static type annotations, no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports describe code that is purely static, consisting of type annotations, TypedDict classes, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Malware/Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** The overall security risk is negligible, as there are no runtime operations, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores Justification:** The malware score remains at 0 in all reports, which is appropriate. The obfuscated score is also 0, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0** for overall security risk.\n- **Malware Score:** Confirmed at **0**, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Confirmed at **0**, code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a static, well-structured set of type annotations and data definitions for the ssm-sap service SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or runtime vulnerabilities. The purpose is purely to facilitate type safety and documentation, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
