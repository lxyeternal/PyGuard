{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for ssm-sap service types, facilitating type safety and documentation for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Constant imports from literals module, sys.version_info checks, and all class/variable definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external system interactions are present; only data structure definitions and type annotations are defined.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to static type annotations and data structure definitions; no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; code primarily consists of TypedDict definitions and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple TypedDict classes for structured data modeling related to the ssm-sap service. It conditionally imports type hints based on Python version, which is standard practice. There are no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network operations. The code appears to be well-structured type annotations for AWS SDK type definitions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type definitions and imports intended for type safety and documentation. There is no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. The code serves its purpose as a type annotation module without any security risks.",
