  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS SSM SAP service interactions, mainly for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys.version_info, and various type annotation imports. No input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted data or external inputs. No network, file, or system command interactions detected.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks. The code solely defines static types and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard type definitions, with no signs of obfuscated or unusual code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "This code provides Python TypedDict classes and type annotations for a specific AWS service SDK. It relies on standard Python features, conditional imports based on Python version, and type hints. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing is present. It appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions intended for type checking and documentation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static type definition for AWS SDK, with no signs of malware, malicious activity, or security risks. It serves as a helper for type safety and documentation without executing any logic or handling untrusted data.",
