  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the ssm-sap service client in boto3, providing structured access to paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions. No external data inputs or user inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead untrusted data to vulnerable operations. The code defines classes and methods for paginating AWS responses without executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data directly.",
  "flows": "The class methods call the paginate() method, which returns a PageIterator over response data. No untrusted data flows into security-critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. The code appears to be straightforward type annotations and class definitions with no obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of paginator class definitions for AWS ssm-sap service, including type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and class methods for pagination. It relies on standard libraries and typing extensions, with no dynamic code execution or data manipulation. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The overall structure is consistent with type hinting and SDK extension practices. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code features detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of paginator class definitions with type annotations for AWS SDK. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks identified.",
