{
  "purpose": "Define paginators for the ssm-sap service client with type annotations for use with boto3-stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; uses sys.version_info for conditional imports; defines classes with paginate methods.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs with types from type_defs and return PageIterator objects; no untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Code receives parameters in paginate methods, which are typed and unpacked; these flow into PageIterator returns. No external or untrusted data sources detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors observed. The code appears to be standard type annotation definitions for paginators.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up paginator classes with type annotations, conditional imports based on Python version, and type checking logic. All methods are simple wrappers around boto3 paginator functionality, with no suspicious data handling or malicious logic. The code is structured, well-documented, and focuses on type annotations and interface definitions. There are no signs of malware or security risks beyond standard type hints and interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type-annotated paginator class definitions for boto3 ssm-sap client. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
