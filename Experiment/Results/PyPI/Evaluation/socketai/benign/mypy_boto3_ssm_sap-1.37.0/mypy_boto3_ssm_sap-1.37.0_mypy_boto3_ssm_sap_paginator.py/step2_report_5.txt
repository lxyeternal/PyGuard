  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and paginator class definitions for ssm-sap, based on standard imports and version checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The paginate methods accept **kwargs, which are typed and flow into PageIterator returns. No external or untrusted data sources are identified.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is boilerplate for type annotations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard, with a high confidence level (1.0). No malware or security risks are present.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is boilerplate, with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on defining paginators with type annotations, with standard imports and version checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The paginate methods accept **kwargs with specific types, flowing into PageIterator objects. No untrusted data sources are detected.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also accurate, with a confidence of 1.0. No security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard SDK extension code, safe and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines paginator classes for ssm-sap, with similar import patterns and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sources or sinks; parameters flow into boto3's paginator.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The code is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with high confidence (0.95). No malware or security issues.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is boilerplate for type annotations, safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on type annotations and paginator class definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The paginate methods accept **kwargs with specific types, flowing into PageIterator objects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct, with confidence 1.0. No security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is correct; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines paginator classes with type annotations, similar to others.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; parameters flow into PageIterator.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, with full confidence (1.0). No malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly characterizes the code as boilerplate, safe, and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No, all reports describe standard, boilerplate paginator class definitions for boto3 with type annotations.\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:** None detected. The code is straightforward, with conditional imports for compatibility, and method signatures matching boto3's paginator pattern.\n- **Scores & Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 in all reports. No malicious behavior or code.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports. No obfuscation or hidden code.\n  - **Risk Score:** Very low (around 0.1), justified by the code's nature as SDK boilerplate with no security implications.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, standard boilerplate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, as the code is purely for type annotations and SDK interface definitions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate for paginators with type annotations. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.",
