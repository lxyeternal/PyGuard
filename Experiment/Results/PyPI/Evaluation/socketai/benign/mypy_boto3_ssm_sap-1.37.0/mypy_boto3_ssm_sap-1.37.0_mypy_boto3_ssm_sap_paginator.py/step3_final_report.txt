  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for boto3 ssm-sap service client paginators, facilitating static type checking and API interface clarity.",
  "sources": "The get_paginator method calls, class constructors, and **kwargs parameters in paginate methods, which accept specific input types for pagination.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs, which flow into PageIterator returns; no untrusted data is processed into security-sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from method calls into PageIterator objects via **kwargs; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or unusual patterns; standard conditional import for Python version compatibility; no dynamic code execution or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for paginators with type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and methods that accept **kwargs returning PageIterator objects. It aligns with boto3 SDK patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of **kwargs is standard for pagination parameters, and the code is purely static type annotations and interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of paginator class definitions for boto3's ssm-sap client, with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a type hinting and interface layer, with no data leaks, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
