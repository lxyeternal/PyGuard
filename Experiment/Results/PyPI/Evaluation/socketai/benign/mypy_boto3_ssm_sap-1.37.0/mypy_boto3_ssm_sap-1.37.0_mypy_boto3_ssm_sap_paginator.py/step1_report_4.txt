{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator classes for the ssm-sap service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe pagination over AWS resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and botocore.paginate; type definitions from .type_defs; class methods that accept **kwargs for pagination parameters.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept untrusted input via **kwargs, but these are standard pagination parameters and are safely passed to the boto3 Paginator class.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from callers flow into the paginate method's **kwargs, which are then passed to the Paginator's paginate method, generating a PageIterator of output types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code strictly defines type annotations and paginator classes based on boto3 and type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines strongly-typed paginator classes for the ssm-sap AWS service, utilizing conditional imports for type checking and modern Python features. It imports necessary modules and type definitions, then defines classes that extend boto3's Paginator, providing paginate methods that accept unpacked input types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling; all code adheres to standard patterns for boto3 stub definitions and pagination. No insecure code or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for boto3's ssm-sap service, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a type-annotated AWS SDK stub library.",
