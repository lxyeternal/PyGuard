{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginator classes for the ssm-sap service client in boto3, enabling type-safe pagination.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; type annotations used within class methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external data output, or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Method calls to 'paginate' receive **kwargs with specific types, which are returned as PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. Use of type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines paginator classes with type annotations, extending botocore.paginate.Paginator, with conditional import of Unpack. No data is read from external sources or written to untrusted sinks. The paginate methods accept kwargs with specific type definitions, which are returned as PageIterator. The code adheres to standard patterns for type-safe SDK extensions, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for boto3 with type annotations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It appears safe and intended solely for type checking and API interface purposes.",
