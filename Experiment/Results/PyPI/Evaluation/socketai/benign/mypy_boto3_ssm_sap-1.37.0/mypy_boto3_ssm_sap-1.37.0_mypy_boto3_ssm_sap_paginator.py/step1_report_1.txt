  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the ssm-sap service client, facilitating paginated API calls with proper type hints.",
  "sources": "User-defined module imports, system version info check, and the paginator classes' method parameters, especially the 'paginate' methods which accept dynamic keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods, which accept **kwargs, could potentially be misused if untrusted data were passed; however, these are intended to be used with specific input types for paginated API calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) flows into the 'paginate' method of each paginator class, which returns a PageIterator of the respective output type, but there are no indications of malicious data manipulation or secret exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The version check for 'Unpack' import is standard for type compatibility and does not indicate obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for paginators in a boto3 client. All code appears to be standard boilerplate for type hinting and paginator abstraction. There are no functions performing network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic identified. The import statements and conditional type imports are typical for compatibility across Python versions. The use of dynamic typing with **kwargs in 'paginate' methods is consistent with boto3's paginator design and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type-annotated paginator module for boto3, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily facilitates paginated API calls with proper type hints, and all patterns are consistent with common SDK boilerplate.",
