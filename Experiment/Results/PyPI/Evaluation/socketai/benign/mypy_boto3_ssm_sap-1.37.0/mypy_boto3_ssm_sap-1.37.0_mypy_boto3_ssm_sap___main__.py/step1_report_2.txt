  "purpose": "CLI entry point for displaying package information and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, sys.argv for input/arguments.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which writes to stdout. Otherwise, print_info() writes package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. No suspicious external calls or data leaks. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script. It imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and controls flow based on command-line arguments. There are no external network calls, no file operations, and no dynamic code execution. It only outputs static information based on user input, with no hidden or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple CLI interface for informational output. No malicious or security-risk behaviors are present.",
