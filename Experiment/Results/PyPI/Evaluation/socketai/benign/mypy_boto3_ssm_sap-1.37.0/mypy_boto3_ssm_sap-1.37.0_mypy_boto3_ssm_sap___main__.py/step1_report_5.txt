  "sources": "sys.argv (user input), sys.stdout (output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (writes output data), sys.argv (reads input arguments)",
  "flows": "User input in sys.argv triggers print_version, which then leads to sys.stdout output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and solely outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs package info or version based on command-line argument. It does not process untrusted data beyond reading command-line arguments, which are limited. No secrets, credentials, or external data fetching occurs. The code does not execute or include dynamic code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious logic. It is a standard informational script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended only for informational output in a CLI environment. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
