{
  "purpose": "Provide a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; outputs static strings via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data handling or external network calls.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) leading to either print_version() or print_info() output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and lacks obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that responds to '--version' argument by printing version info, otherwise prints package info. It uses static strings, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no secrets. The logic is simple, transparent, and safe. No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present. The command-line argument handling is limited and controlled. The code's purpose is purely informational, with no external dependencies or risky behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a simple CLI utility for displaying package info. All signals indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores should be set to zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk categories.",
