  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**1. Content Confirmation and Code Behavior**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments. The code does not perform any network operations, handle untrusted input beyond command-line args, or execute dynamic code. No credentials, secrets, or obfuscated/malicious code are present.\n\n**2. Logical and Reasoning Flaws**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning. They correctly interpret the code flow, the absence of external calls, and the benign nature of the script. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated score (0.0):** Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Malware score (0.0):** Correct, no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Security risk (0.0 or 0.1):** Given the benign nature, a score of 0.0 is appropriate. A minimal 0.1 might be considered if one is overly cautious about any CLI tool, but since there's no vulnerability or risk, 0.0 is justified.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**  \nNone of the reports suggest any reason to assign a high risk score. The code is purely informational, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. Therefore, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n**5. Malware and Obfuscation**  \nAll reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation. This aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are consistent with the code.\n\n**7. Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the code's behavior. The uniformity across reports supports the conclusion that the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n**Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a simple CLI script with static output.  \n- No external connections, dynamic code, or secrets.  \n- No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.  \n- The code is transparent and well-understood.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a benign, standard CLI utility intended for informational purposes only. No security risks or malware concerns are present.",
