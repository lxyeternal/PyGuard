{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point to display package information or version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and writes output to stdout.",
  "kills": "Outputs package information and version details to stdout based on command-line input.",
  "flows": "User inputs '--version' triggers print_version(), otherwise print_info() is called, both writing to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious data handling observed. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for input/output operations, defines functions to print package info and version, and processes command-line arguments in main(). It only outputs static, predefined strings based on user input, with no external data fetching, network activity, or code execution. The code structure is straightforward and typical for CLI tools. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying static package information and version, with no malicious behavior or security risks present.",
