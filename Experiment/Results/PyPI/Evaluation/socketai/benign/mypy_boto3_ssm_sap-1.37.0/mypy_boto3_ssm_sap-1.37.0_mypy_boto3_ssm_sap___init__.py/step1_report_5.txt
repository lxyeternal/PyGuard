{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface and documentation for the ssm-sap service, importing and exposing relevant classes and clients.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from relative paths (.client and .paginator). No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or actions are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The copyright year appears to be future-dated (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, a variable assignment (Client), and an __all__ declaration. It primarily acts as a module interface, with no runtime logic, user input handling, or external data processing. The future-dated copyright might be a typo or placeholder but does not imply malicious intent. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an interface layer for the ssm-sap service client and paginator classes, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign module setup.",
