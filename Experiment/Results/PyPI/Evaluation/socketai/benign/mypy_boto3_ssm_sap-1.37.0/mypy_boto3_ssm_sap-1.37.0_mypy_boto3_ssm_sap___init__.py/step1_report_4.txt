  "purpose": "This code provides a main interface and documentation for the ssm-sap service client, acting as a module that imports and exposes relevant classes and functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings, module imports, and documentation comments. No external or untrusted data input is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the code mainly imports modules and defines exports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports components from local modules and defines a Client alias and __all__ for exports. The embedded documentation provides usage instructions and does not execute any sensitive operations or handle external inputs. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured interface module intended to expose a client and related paginators for the ssm-sap service. It contains no malicious or suspicious code. It is safe for use.",
