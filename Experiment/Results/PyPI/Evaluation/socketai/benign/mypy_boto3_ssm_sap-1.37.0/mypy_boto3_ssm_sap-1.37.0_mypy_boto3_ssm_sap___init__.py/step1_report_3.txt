{
  "purpose": "Provide a main interface for the ssm-sap service, including documentation and type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client and .paginator), static string documentation.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no dynamic data flow or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward module export and documentation with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and functions from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, serving as an interface layer. The documentation string provides usage instructions and a link. There is no user input, network activity, or dynamic execution present. The code does not include any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Overall, this appears to be a benign, standard module setup for a Python SDK or client library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module definition providing imports and documentation for a client library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a safe, well-structured interface module.",
