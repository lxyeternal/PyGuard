  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior**  \n   All reports uniformly conclude that the code is a straightforward module setup with no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious behavior. The code consists solely of imports, an alias, and an `__all__` declaration.  \n   **Malware score: 0** — consistent across all reports and justified.\n\n2. **Obfuscation**  \n   The code is clear, with no obfuscated strings, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs. The only minor anomaly is the copyright year set to 2025, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.  \n   **Obfuscated score: 0** — justified and consistent.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Logic Flaws**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is a benign interface layer. No input handling, no external data processing, no secrets, no network activity, and no code obfuscation.  \n   **Security risk score: 0** — appropriate.\n\n4. **Scores Consistency and Reasonableness**  \n   All reports assign maximum confidence (1.0) and zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores. This is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**  \n   - The only notable point is the future-dated copyright year (2025). While unusual, it doesn't imply malicious intent.  \n   - No other assumptions or vulnerabilities are suggested or implied.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign, standard interface module for a client library.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified.\n- No changes needed in scoring.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe report's evaluations are accurate and well-justified. The code snippet is safe, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code, and poses no security risks.",
