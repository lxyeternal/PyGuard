{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module interface for the ssm-sap service, providing class imports and documentation for users to interact with the AWS SDK components.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports classes from internal modules (.client and .paginator).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow is static; it imports classes and sets up aliases and exports without runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year '2025', which is future-dated but not malicious or suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static module that imports specific classes, defines an alias, and sets __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, or network activity. The documentation provides usage instructions. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The only anomaly is the future-dated copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or typo. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured interface module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
