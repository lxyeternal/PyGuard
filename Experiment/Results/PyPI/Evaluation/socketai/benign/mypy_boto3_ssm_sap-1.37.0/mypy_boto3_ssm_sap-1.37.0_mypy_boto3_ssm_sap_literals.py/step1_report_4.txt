  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service and resource identifiers used in type annotations for boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Code imports sys, conditionally imports Literal, and defines multiple Literal type aliases with hardcoded string values.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data or interacts with external systems directly; it solely defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or data processing in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive hardcoded string literals for AWS resource and service names. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are involved. No suspicious code constructs or obfuscation is present. No code executes dynamically or accesses sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for defining string literal types using Python's Literal from typing (or typing_extensions). It includes a conditional import based on Python version, which is standard. All type definitions are static and predefined, with no runtime data processing or external interactions. The copyright notice and documentation link do not affect security. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward, benign module defining type aliases for AWS service identifiers. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. Its purpose is purely for type safety and code clarity in type annotations.",
