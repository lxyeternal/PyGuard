  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for AWS SDK for Python (boto3) service and resource identifiers to ensure type safety and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions for various AWS service names, resource names, and enums, along with conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; the code only defines static type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code purely declares constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected. The copyright notice claims 2025, which may be a typo or an indicator of an intentionally fabricated date, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static set of type alias definitions using Python's 'Literal' for enhanced type safety and autocompletion. It includes conditional import to maintain compatibility across Python versions. No input handling, network communication, file operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code's purpose is purely to provide type annotations for AWS SDK literals. The large number of string literals is static and safe. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leakage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purely declarative module providing type aliases for AWS SDK resource and service identifiers. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected. All elements serve to facilitate type checking and auto-completion.",
