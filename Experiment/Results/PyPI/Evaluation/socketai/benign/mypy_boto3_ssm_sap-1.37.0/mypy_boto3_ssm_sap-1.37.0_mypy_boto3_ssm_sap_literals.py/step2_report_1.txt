  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines static string literal types for AWS SSM-SAP parameters, with standard import logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or user input; purely static.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; straightforward static type definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, static, and purely for type hinting.\n- **Risk & Malware:** Score 0.5 for risk seems high; the code is static and safe. Malware score 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n\n**Recommendation:** Reduce risk score to 0, as no security risk exists.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, defining literals for ssm-sap service parameters.\n- No dynamic behavior or external data.\n- Proper documentation and standard pattern.\n- **Risk & Malware:** Both scores 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; static definitions only.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Defines numerous AWS resource and service string literals.\n- No external data, dynamic code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The only oddity is the copyright year 2025, which may be a typo or an intentional placeholder but not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent with static, benign code.\n- **Security risk:** 0, as no dynamic or sensitive data handling.\n\n**Conclusion:** Completely benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar pattern: static string literals for AWS identifiers.\n- No external data, no dynamic code.\n- Large number of hardcoded strings, but all safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, static, and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Defines string literals for ssm-sap service, with version check and conditional import.\n- No data flow, no external input, no dynamic behavior.\n- Completely static definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as static, safe, and purely for type annotations.\n- The only questionable point is the risk score in Report 1, which is set at 0.5. Given the code's static nature, this is an overestimate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all, as there are no security risks, dynamic behaviors, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a static, benign module providing type annotations for AWS SDK identifiers. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The only adjustment needed is lowering the risk score in Report 1 to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores for the entire code:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely static, well-documented, and free of malicious intent.",
