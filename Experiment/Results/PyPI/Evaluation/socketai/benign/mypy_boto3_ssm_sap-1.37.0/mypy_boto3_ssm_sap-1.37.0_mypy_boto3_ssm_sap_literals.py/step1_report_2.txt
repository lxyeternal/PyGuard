{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations for literals used in the ssm-sap service, facilitating type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string literals used to define various type annotations, primarily at the module level.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points of untrusted data input are present; the code solely defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or untrusted data handling; the code only establishes type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python type annotations with conditional import for compatibility, which is common practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining string literal types for use elsewhere in the project. It imports 'Literal' conditionally based on Python version, which is standard. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The presence of a copyright statement and documentation links indicates proper documentation and intent. Overall, the code appears solely as type annotation definitions without any malicious content or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type annotations and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, safe implementation for defining literals for type checking.",
