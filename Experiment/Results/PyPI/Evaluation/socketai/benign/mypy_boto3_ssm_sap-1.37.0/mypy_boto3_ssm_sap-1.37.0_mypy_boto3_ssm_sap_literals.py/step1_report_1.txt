{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS SSM-SAP service parameters and other related identifiers using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to type aliases; import statements for 'sys' and conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic input or untrusted data sources; no external data reads or outputs that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "None; all definitions are static type annotations and import statements without data flow or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected. The code is straightforward type alias definitions with conditional import logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for a set of string literals representing AWS service constants. It uses a conditional import to ensure compatibility with Python versions prior to 3.12. There are no runtime computations, user inputs, or external data handling. All the code is static and designed for type hinting only. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The license or copyright statement is non-intrusive and appears standard. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, just static definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static module providing type alias definitions for AWS service identifiers. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves solely as a type definition resource for static type checkers.",
