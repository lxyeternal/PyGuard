  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, purpose, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining string literal types for AWS services, resource names, and identifiers.\n- It uses conditional imports to maintain compatibility with Python versions before 3.12.\n- There are no runtime computations, data processing, user inputs, or external data interactions.\n- No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The copyright date (2025) appears to be a typo or intentionally set, but this alone is not suspicious.\n- The purpose is to provide type annotations for static type checking, autocompletion, and code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS SSM-SAP service parameters.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies; static definitions, no data flow or external inputs.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely for type annotations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Defines type annotations for literals used in ssm-sap.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; standard static definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious content or security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for AWS SDK for Python (boto3) identifiers.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; large set of static string literals.\n- **Note:** The copyright year (2025) might be a typo or fabricated, but this is not inherently malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** String literal types for AWS service/resource identifiers.\n- **Analysis:** All static, no dynamic or external data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for ssm-sap service literals.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware risk. The code is static, with no code execution, external data, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, the risk score should be 0, as there are no security vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- The code is a static, well-documented set of type alias definitions for AWS service constants.\n- The conditional import for 'Literal' is standard practice for compatibility.\n- The large set of string literals does not pose any security threat.\n- The copyright year (2025) might be a typo or an intentional placeholder, but it does not impact security.\n\n**Therefore, I recommend:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Set to 0, as the code poses no security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a safe, static module for type annotations, with no malicious or obfuscated content, and no security risks.",
