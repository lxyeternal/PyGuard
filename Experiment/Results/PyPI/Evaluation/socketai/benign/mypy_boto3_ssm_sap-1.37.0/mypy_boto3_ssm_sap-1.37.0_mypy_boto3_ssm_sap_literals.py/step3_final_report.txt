  "purpose": "Defines static string literal types for AWS SSM-SAP parameters and related identifiers, serving as type annotations for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals for AWS resource and service names, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions without external data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely static type alias assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code. The copyright year 2025 appears to be a typo or placeholder but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static string literal definitions used for type annotations, with conditional import for compatibility. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data interactions, or obfuscated code. The large set of string constants is standard for type safety and autocompletion. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, static, and intended solely for type hinting. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
