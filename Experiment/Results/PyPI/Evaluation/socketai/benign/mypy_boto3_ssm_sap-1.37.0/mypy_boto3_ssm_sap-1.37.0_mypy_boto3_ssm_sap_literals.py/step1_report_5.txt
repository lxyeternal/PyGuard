{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal types used in the ssm-sap service, facilitating type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads system version info via sys.version_info and imports Literal from either typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward type definitions module with no dynamic code execution, external data input, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to check Python version and conditionally imports Literal for type annotations. It then defines numerous string literal type aliases for the ssm-sap service. No input handling, network activity, file operations, or dynamic execution exists. The code is purely declarative, providing type hints for other modules. The inclusion of a copyright notice and documentation link is benign. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. The structure is consistent with standard type definition modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions for string literals, with no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues. It is a typical type annotations module for a Python SDK or library.",
