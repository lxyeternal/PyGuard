  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS SSM for SAP service, enabling interaction with AWS APIs with type safety.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, docstrings, type annotations, and property/method implementations.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code primarily defines an interface and does not handle untrusted data or perform network operations directly.",
  "flows": "N/A. The code is interface/structure definition only; no data flow execution is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are evident. No use of dynamic execution or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for AWS SSM for SAP with type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links. It relies on external libraries (boto3, botocore, typing_extensions) and standard Python constructs. There are no operations, data processing, or network interactions implemented within this code snippet. The class and method structures are consistent with a standard SDK interface, focusing on type safety and documentation. No signs of malicious or sabotage code are present. The only noteworthy aspect is comprehensive type annotation for a large API surface, which is normal for SDK stubs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface for AWS SSM for SAP, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a type declaration layer with no runtime logic or data handling that could be exploited.",
