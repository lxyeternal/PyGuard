  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for interacting with AWS SSM SAP service via boto3-stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and relative local modules; class and method definitions; type annotations and overloads.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; methods primarily define interfaces and type hints.",
  "flows": "Code defines interfaces and type annotations; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is a straightforward, well-structured client interface with documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations, class structures, and method signatures for a boto3 client to interact with AWS SSM SAP. It imports standard libraries and AWS SDK components, sets up client exceptions, and defines a class with method signatures aligned with AWS API endpoints. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data processing logic is present. There are no signs of malicious code such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The presence of documentation URLs and type hints indicates a focus on maintainability and correctness, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type annotation and client interface for AWS SSM SAP, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
