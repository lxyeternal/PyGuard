  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS SSM SAP client, facilitating type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Method parameters accepting kwargs unpacked into specific input type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Methods like generate_presigned_url that produce URLs; potential misuse if parameters are untrusted, but standard in SDKs.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into SDK methods, which may generate URLs or perform API calls; no data leaks or malicious actions evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is a straightforward SDK interface.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, type-annotated SDK client for AWS SSM SAP, with no executable logic beyond method signatures. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The presence of generate_presigned_url is typical but requires cautious use, which is a known SDK consideration. The code's design aligns with standard SDK patterns, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, safe SDK interface layer with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
