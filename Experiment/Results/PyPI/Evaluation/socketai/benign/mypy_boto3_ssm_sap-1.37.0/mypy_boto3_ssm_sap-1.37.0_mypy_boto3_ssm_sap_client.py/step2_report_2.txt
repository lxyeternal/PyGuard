  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and client class for AWS SSM SAP, with documentation links.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods accept untrusted input via kwargs; no evidence of data leaks or malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Functions are interface definitions, standard for SDKs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears benign, with high confidence (0.95). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious behavior detected. The score of malware 0 and obfuscated 0 are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, describing an SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Generate presigned URLs could be misused but are standard in SDKs; no direct malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code. The code is a typical SDK interface.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also justified with malware 0, obfuscated 0, and high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious intent, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations and SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No unsafe data flows; no network or system manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, benign SDK stub with malware 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK interface with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evident malicious data flow; standard SDK patterns.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code; standard import and class structure.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, malware 0, obfuscated 0, high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasoning is sound and scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK wrapper with method signatures, including generate_presigned_url.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** URLs generated could be misused if parameters are untrusted, but this is typical SDK behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code. The code is a standard SDK pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, malware 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard SDK interface with no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscated are all 0, justified by the absence of suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting thorough analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Overall Malware Score:** 0  \n**Overall Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Overall Risk Score:** 0.1 (low, due to potential misuse of presigned URLs if parameters are untrusted, but this is standard SDK behavior)\n\n**Justification:** The code is a well-structured, type-annotated SDK interface with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The only minor concern is the potential misuse of presigned URLs, but this is inherent to the functionality and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to URL generation capabilities, not malicious)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign nature and appropriateness of the current scores.",
