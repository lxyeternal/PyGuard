Slightly increasing Report 2's malware score improves accuracy. The evidence-based scoring system is consistent and justified."

The deserialization logic and use of introspection are typical and safe in this context. The low risk scores are justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. Overall, the code poses minimal security concerns."

The primary concern is the potential misuse of dynamic features if inputs are malicious, but no actual malicious activity is present. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) justified by the use of reflection in a trusted context."
