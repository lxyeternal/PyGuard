{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a utility module for translating schema types into Python type annotations, likely used for code generation or validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'resolved_type' parameter, which includes properties like 'container' and 'type'. It also imports constants from 'rpdk.core.jsonutils.resolver'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data, nor does it execute any untrusted input directly. No dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "The function 'translate_type' calls itself recursively on 'resolved_type.type'. No other data flows or external interactions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mapping for primitive types and a function to translate 'resolved_type' objects into Python type annotations, handling various container types such as MODEL, PRIMITIVE, MULTIPLE, DICT, LIST, and SET. It employs recursive calls for nested types and raises errors for unknown container types. The second function checks if a type contains a model. There are no external data injections, network operations, or suspicious code paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module focused on type translation and analysis. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The structure and logic are consistent with code generation or schema validation utilities.",
