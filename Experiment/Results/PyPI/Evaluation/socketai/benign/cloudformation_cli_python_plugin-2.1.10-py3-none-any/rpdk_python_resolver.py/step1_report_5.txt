{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle type translation and recognition for a JSON schema resolver, converting schema types into Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported 'resolved_type' object, specifically its 'type' and 'container' attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or execute untrusted data; it primarily returns string representations of types based on schema input.",
  "flows": "Input schema type data flows into 'translate_type' function, which processes 'resolved_type' to produce string annotations; 'contains_model' recursively checks for model types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward schema type translation to Python type hints, utilizing predefined mappings and recursive functions for nested types. It imports specific types from an external module and uses conditional logic to handle various container types. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or suspicious behavior. The functions are limited to string processing and type inference, with no side effects or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical schema-to-type translation utility with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It simply maps schema definitions to Python type annotations without executing or exposing sensitive data.",
