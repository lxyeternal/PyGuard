{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for translating schema types and checking if a type contains a model, likely used for schema or code generation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is derived from 'resolved_type', which is expected to be an object with attributes 'container' and 'type'. The code reads from 'resolved_type' properties.",
  "fires": "The code does not directly write or output untrusted data; it constructs and returns string representations of types and performs type checks.",
  "flows": "Input 'resolved_type' is used to generate type annotations; the 'translate_type' function recursively calls itself to handle nested types; 'contains_model' recursively checks nested types for a model container.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on standard Python data structures and string formatting without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of type translation and containment checks, using enums or constants for container types. It performs recursion for nested types and generates type annotations for code generation or validation. No external or untrusted data manipulation, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for schema type handling with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks.",
