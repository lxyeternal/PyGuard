{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions for translating schema types into Python type annotations, likely for code generation or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported constants UNDEFINED and ContainerType, and the input parameter 'resolved_type' in the functions translate_type and contains_model.",
  "sinks": "The functions process 'resolved_type' objects to produce string outputs for type annotations; no untrusted data is written to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input 'resolved_type' is checked for container type, which determines the output string; no external data flows or side effects are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code performs straightforward type translation logic with recursion for nested types.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants and defines mappings for primitive types. The 'translate_type' function recursively translates 'resolved_type' objects into Python type annotations based on their container type, handling models, primitives, collections, and unknown types with a ValueError. The 'contains_model' function checks if a type or its nested type is a model. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The logic is clear, standard, and used for schema-based code generation or validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for translating schema types into Python type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is a benign, well-structured implementation.",
