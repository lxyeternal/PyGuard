  "purpose": "Utility functions for translating schema types into Python type annotations and checking for models within nested types.",
  "sources": "Attributes 'container' and 'type' of 'resolved_type' object, used in type translation and containment checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external outputs, or side effects; purely computational functions.",
  "flows": "Input 'resolved_type' flows through recursive 'translate_type' and 'contains_model' functions, with no external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward, well-structured logic; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mappings for primitive types and handles various container types (MODEL, PRIMITIVE, MULTIPLE, DICT, LIST, SET). It recursively translates types based on container attributes, raising errors for unknown types. The 'contains_model' function checks recursively for model containers. No external data manipulation, network calls, or side effects are present. The code is clear, standard for schema-to-Python translation, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for schema type translation with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code's purpose and behavior confirm its safety.",
