{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions for translating schema types into Python type annotations and checking if a schema type contains a model.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (`rpdk.core.jsonutils.resolver`) and the `resolved_type` parameter passed into functions.",
  "sinks": "The code performs string formatting to generate type annotation strings; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "The functions process `resolved_type` objects through attribute access, recursive calls, and string formatting to produce type annotation strings or boolean checks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code uses standard control flow and string formatting for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes/constants, defines a dictionary for primitive type mappings, and two functions: `translate_type` and `contains_model`. The `translate_type` function converts a `resolved_type` object into a string representing a Python type annotation based on its container type. It handles various container types like MODEL, PRIMITIVE, MULTIPLE, DICT, LIST, and SET, with recursion for nested types. The `contains_model` function checks recursively whether a type includes a model container. Both functions rely on safe attribute access and standard Python constructs; no external data is processed or transmitted. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for type translation and schema analysis, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical schema processing code with safe practices and no suspicious behavior.",
