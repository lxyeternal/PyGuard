  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard deserialization template with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is the potential misuse of dynamic features if inputs are malicious, but no actual malicious activity is present. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) justified by the use of reflection in a trusted context."
