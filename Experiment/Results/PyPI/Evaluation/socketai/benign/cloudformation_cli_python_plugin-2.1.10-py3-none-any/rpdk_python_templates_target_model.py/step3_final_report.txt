  "sinks": "recast_object, deserialize_list, json_data.get()",
  "flows": "json_data -> _deserialize -> recast_object / deserialize_list",
  "anomalies": "Use of introspection (getmembers, isclass), templating syntax, no runtime code execution",
  "analysis": "The code is a static template for creating data models for CloudFormation, utilizing standard deserialization functions and introspection for dynamic class handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of introspection and deserialization functions could pose risks if the environment is compromised, but in isolation, the code is benign. The deserialization process is typical for such models, with no external system calls or network activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the analysis, reflecting a very low security risk primarily related to potential misuse if environment is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard template for CloudFormation resource models. It contains no malicious activity or backdoors. The deserialization logic and use of introspection are typical and safe in this context. The low risk scores are justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. Overall, the code poses minimal security concerns.",
