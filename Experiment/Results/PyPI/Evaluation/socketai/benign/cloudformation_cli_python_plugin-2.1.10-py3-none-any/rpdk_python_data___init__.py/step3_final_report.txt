  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network requests, eval/exec calls, hardcoded URLs or IPs.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval or network data flow into code execution or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic eval/exec, suspicious URLs, hardcoded credentials, high obfuscation levels.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 lacks code, so all scores are set to zero. Report 2 shows suspicious patterns like eval and obfuscation but no confirmed malicious activity; scores are reasonable but could slightly increase malware suspicion. Report 3 exhibits high obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious URLs, justifying high scores (0.9 obfuscated, 0.8 malware, 0.8 risk). Report 4 and 5 show benign code with no suspicious features, scores appropriately low (0 or 0.2). Overall, scores align with evidence; minor adjustments recommended for Report 2's malware score (increase from 0.2 to 0.3) to reflect dynamic features. Final overall scores: malware ~0.75, obfuscated ~0.4, security risk ~0.5, consistent with the evidence and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports' scores are appropriate; Report 3 indicates high malicious potential justifying high scores. Reports 1, 4, and 5 are benign with low scores. Slightly increasing Report 2's malware score improves accuracy. The evidence-based scoring system is consistent and justified.",
