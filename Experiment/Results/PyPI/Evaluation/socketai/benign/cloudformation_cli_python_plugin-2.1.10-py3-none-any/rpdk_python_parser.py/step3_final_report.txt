  "purpose": "Functions to set up command-line argument parsers for different Python versions with optional Docker flags.",
  "sources": "Parameters `subparsers`, `parents`, `python_version`, `python_version_number` used in `add_parser` and `add_argument` calls.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Configuration functions passing parameters to argparse methods; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; straightforward static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static functions for CLI setup, using standard argparse methods. It does not process untrusted input, perform network or file operations, or execute dynamic code. The parameters are typical for CLI configuration and are unlikely to be influenced maliciously. The code's purpose is purely for argument parsing setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are justified given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI argument parser setup with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
