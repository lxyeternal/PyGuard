{
  "purpose": "The code implements AWS CloudFormation hook handlers for create, update, and delete operations, primarily to enforce custom resource constraints or behaviors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from 'targetModel', specifically 'resourceProperties' and 'previousResourceProperties' fields within the hook context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the creation of an S3 client via session.client('s3') and raising exceptions. No direct data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Input from 'targetModel' -> conditional logic for resource property comparison -> possible exception raising or progress status updates. The session client creation could be a sink if misused, but in this context, it's standard AWS SDK use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is largely boilerplate with placeholders for custom logic. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The handlers perform standard CloudFormation hook operations: reading resource properties, comparing previous and current states, and setting progress statuses. Exception handling is conventional, catching TypeError and raising internal failures. The S3 client instantiation relies on a session object, which is standard. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code structure is straightforward and does not include any suspicious or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical CloudFormation hook implementation with placeholder areas for custom logic. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident based on the provided code. It is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
