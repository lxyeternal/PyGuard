  "purpose": "AWS CloudFormation custom resource hook handlers for create, update, and delete operations, performing validation and status updates.",
  "sources": "targetModel.get('resourceProperties'), targetModel.get('previousResourceProperties'), session.client('s3')",
  "sinks": "ProgressEvent status updates, exception raising for internal failures",
  "flows": "Reading resource properties from targetModel, creating S3 client from session, setting progress status based on validation",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder 'TODO' comments indicating incomplete logic, no suspicious or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of CloudFormation hooks with typical resource validation and status management. It handles resource properties safely, uses session clients appropriately, and includes exception handling for predictable errors. No hardcoded secrets, network communications, or obfuscated code are present. Placeholder comments suggest incomplete logic but do not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign, boilerplate nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or security flaws. The low risk score reflects minimal inherent security concern, primarily due to incomplete implementation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of CloudFormation resource hooks with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The placeholder comments indicate incomplete logic but do not introduce vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
