{
  "purpose": "This code implements AWS CloudFormation custom resource hooks for create, update, and delete operations, mainly for validation and control of resource properties during provisioning.",
  "sources": "Reads targetModel from request.hookContext, resourceProperties, previousResourceProperties, and session.client('s3')",
  "sinks": "Session client creation, progress event status updates, exception raising",
  "flows": "Reads resource properties -> compares or processes them -> updates progress status -> may invoke session.client('s3')",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Use of session.client('s3') is standard for AWS SDK calls, no malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation and operational logic for CloudFormation hooks, including handling resource property modifications and session management. Exception handling is typical, and no unusual data flows or suspicious code patterns are present. The use of session.client('s3') is appropriate for AWS SDK interaction. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of CloudFormation hook handlers with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily performs validation and status reporting during resource provisioning.",
