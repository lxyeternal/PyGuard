{
  "purpose": "The code manages project scaffolding, code generation, packaging, and dependency installation for AWS CloudFormation resource providers, with optional Docker build steps.",
  "sources": "Configuration files, resource templates, resource streams, environment variables, and internal variables for command construction.",
  "sinks": "File writes for project files, subprocess calls for dependency installation, Docker container execution, and zipfile writes for packaging.",
  "flows": "Sources such as configuration and resource streams feed into templates and resource files; subprocess commands and Docker calls execute build steps; resulting files are written to disk and zipped for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with 'shell=True' on Windows, marked with 'nosec', but commands are statically constructed from internal variables, minimizing risk. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard plugin for AWS CloudFormation CLI, handling project setup, code generation, dependency management, and packaging. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The subprocess calls with 'shell=True' are controlled and justified, with no user input incorporated into shell commands. Docker interactions are typical for containerized builds. The overall structure and resource handling are consistent with legitimate build tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and intended for project scaffolding and packaging. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are evident. The low malware score (0), no obfuscation (0), and minimal security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
