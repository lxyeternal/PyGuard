  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, auto-generated data model for resource handling in AWS CloudFormation. It employs safe deserialization methods and contains no malicious or suspicious code. The risk of security issues is minimal, primarily related to deserialization of untrusted data, which is a common pattern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.1)."
