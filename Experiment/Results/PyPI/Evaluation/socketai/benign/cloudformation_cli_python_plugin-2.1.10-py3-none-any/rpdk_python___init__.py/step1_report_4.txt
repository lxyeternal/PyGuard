  "purpose": "Configure logging for the package with a default NullHandler to prevent errors if no handlers are added.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports the logging module; the __version__ variable defines the package version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is read; no sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging by adding a NullHandler to prevent 'no handlers' warnings, which is a common practice. The __version__ variable simply states the package version. There are no input sources or output sinks, and no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for safe logging configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard logging setup with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security concerns. It is typical boilerplate code for Python packages.",
