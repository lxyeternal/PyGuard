  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, defines a version string, and adds a NullHandler to the logger for the module's namespace. It is a common pattern used in Python packages to avoid logging warnings when no handlers are set. There are no data leaks, network activity, or malicious behaviors. The code is clear, simple, and adheres to best practices. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign and standard nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard boilerplate for logging configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, as there are no issues or suspicious behaviors.",
