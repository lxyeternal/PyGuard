  "purpose": "Configure logging for a Python module with a default NullHandler to prevent logging errors if no other handlers are set.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's __name__ variable and the string assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no untrusted data or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow paths are present involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and adds a NullHandler to the module's logger to avoid 'No handlers could be found' warnings. It is a standard pattern for library modules to set up safe logging without causing runtime errors. No user input, external data, or security-sensitive operations are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign logging setup for a Python module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
