{
  "purpose": "Configure logging for the package with a null handler to prevent errors if no handlers are set by the user.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ string and the logging configuration to add a NullHandler.",
  "funnels": "The logging setup could potentially suppress logs, but this is standard practice and not malicious.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely sets up logging.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, sets a version string, and adds a NullHandler to the logger for __name__. This prevents logging errors if no other handlers are configured. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be standard initialization code common in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily serving as a safe logging setup for a Python package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
