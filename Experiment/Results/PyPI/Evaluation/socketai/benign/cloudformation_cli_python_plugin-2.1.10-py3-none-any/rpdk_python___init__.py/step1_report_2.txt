  "purpose": "Configure logging with a NullHandler to prevent logging errors if no other handlers are configured",
  "sources": "The module imports the logging library and defines a version string; no input or data reading occurs",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not process untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs in this code segment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; simple logging setup with a version string",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logging setup by adding a NullHandler to prevent 'No handlers could be found' warnings. It defines a version string. No input/output, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is minimal and standard for a package's initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It merely sets up logging behavior for the package.",
