{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of PyObjCTools.Debugging to show Cocoa exceptions, including handling and unhandled cases.",
  "sources": "NSTimer scheduled timers that invoke methods 'doBadThingsNow:' and 'doCBad:' on the FooTester object.",
  "sinks": "The code intentionally raises a ValueError and accesses an array index out of bounds, which could lead to exception handling flows, but no data leaks or malicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Timers trigger methods in FooTester; 'doBadThingsNow:' raises an exception, 'doCBad:' causes an index out of bounds exception; exceptions are handled by Debugging.installVerboseExceptionHandler().",
  "anomalies": "Intentional out-of-bounds array access and forced exception raising; no hidden or malicious behavior; use of exception handling for debugging purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a class with methods that intentionally raise exceptions or cause errors. Timers schedule these methods to run, and a verbose exception handler is installed to catch all exceptions. No external inputs, no data leakage, no suspicious network activity, and no malicious payloads are present. The purpose is clearly debugging and demonstration, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a demonstration script for debugging Cocoa exceptions using PyObjCTools. It intentionally triggers errors for debugging purposes without any malicious intent or harmful behavior. No security risks are present.",
