  "purpose": "Demonstrates handling of Cocoa exceptions in a Python environment, intentionally triggering exceptions for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Array access at index 5 in doCBad_, manual raise of ValueError in doBadThingsNow_",
  "sinks": "Exception handling via Debugging.installVerboseExceptionHandler() captures errors; no data leaks or external sinks present.",
  "flows": "Timer schedules invoke methods that cause exceptions; exception handler captures these exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Intentional array index out-of-bounds access and explicit exception raising for debugging; no malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Cocoa NSObject subclass with methods that intentionally trigger exceptions: an out-of-bounds array access and a manual raise. Timers schedule these methods, and an exception handler is installed to catch all exceptions. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious code are present. The purpose is debugging and demonstration, not malicious activity. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, debugging intent. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging demonstration with intentional exceptions. It contains no malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
