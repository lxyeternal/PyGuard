  "purpose": "Demonstration of using PyObjCTools.Debugging to monitor Cocoa exceptions in a Python script interacting with Objective-C frameworks.",
  "sources": "Input sources are timer triggers that invoke class methods, specifically the scheduled NSTimer instances triggering 'doBadThingsNow:' and 'doCBad:'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the 'NSArray([1])[5]' line which can cause an IndexError, and the 'raise ValueError' which raises an exception; the exception handler installed may capture exceptions.",
  "flows": "Timer triggers methods; 'doCBad_' causes an index out of bounds, and 'doBadThingsNow_' raises an exception after stopping the event loop; exceptions are handled via the installed verbose exception handler.",
  "anomalies": "The method 'doCBad_' accesses an invalid index in NSArray, which is intentionally faulty to demonstrate exception handling. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an NSObject subclass with methods that intentionally trigger exceptions: one by accessing an invalid array index and another by raising a ValueError after stopping the event loop. Timers schedule these methods, and the Debugging module is used to capture all exceptions. No malicious behaviors like data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present. The purpose appears to be educational or debugging related, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign demonstration of exception handling in a Cocoa/Python environment, intentionally triggering exceptions for debugging purposes. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The code’s behavior is consistent with testing exception handling mechanisms.",
