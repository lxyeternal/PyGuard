{
  "purpose": "Unit testing framework wrapping and exception handling for Objective-C bridge in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, objc, and Debugging modules; uses class methods and functions from Debugging and objc to perform tests and handle exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data or could leak data; no data leaks or external communications detected.",
  "flows": "Test methods invoke exception handlers and class methods to raise and handle exceptions, but no untrusted input flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and implements standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit tests on the Debugging module for exception handling and constant verification. It uses class methods to install and remove exception handlers, raises various exceptions, and checks their types. No evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code is purely for testing purposes and does not include any suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing suite for Objective-C exception handling via Python. It contains no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs expected testing operations without external communications or data leaks. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
