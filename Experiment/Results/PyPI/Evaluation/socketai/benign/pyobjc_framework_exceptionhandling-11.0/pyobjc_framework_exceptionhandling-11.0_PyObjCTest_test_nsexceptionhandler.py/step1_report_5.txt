{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for exception handling protocols and constants in an Objective-C Python bridge, specifically testing exception handler delegate behavior and related constants.",
  "sources": "Imports from ExceptionHandling module, test class methods, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily tests constants and method signatures; no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The test methods do not execute or invoke external or untrusted data sources. The only dynamic code is assertions and constant checks.",
  "analysis": "The script defines helper classes and test cases for exception handling protocols and constants. It validates method signatures, return types, and constant values. The code is structured as a standard unit test for Objective-C bridging code, with no evidence of malicious activity or unusual code constructs. No data processing, network activity, or data leaks are observed. The purpose appears to be validation of the API's correctness and consistency, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for exception handling protocols and constants, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It solely performs validation of expected constants and method signatures. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for development/testing purposes.",
