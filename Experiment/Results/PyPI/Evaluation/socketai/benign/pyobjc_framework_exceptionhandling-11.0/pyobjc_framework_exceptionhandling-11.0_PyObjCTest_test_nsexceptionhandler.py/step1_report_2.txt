{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for the NSExceptionHandler delegate protocol in a macOS environment, verifying constants, protocols, and method signatures related to exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports 'ExceptionHandling', 'TestCase' from 'PyObjCTools.TestSupport', and 'objc'; uses class methods and constants from 'ExceptionHandling'.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not perform network operations, file writes, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; mainly static method definitions and constant assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is structured as a test suite for an Objective-C bridge, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward test case for verifying the presence of certain constants, protocols, and method signatures related to exception handling in a macOS environment. It includes helper classes for delegate methods and constants definitions, with no evidence of malicious code, code injection, or suspicious logic. No external data sources, network connections, or sensitive data manipulations are observed. The focus is solely on static assertions and method signature validations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for exception handling protocol verification with no signs of malware or security risks. It only validates constant values, method signatures, and protocol conformance. There are no malicious behaviors or vulnerabilities present.",
