  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package providing wrappers for the macOS ExceptionHandling framework via PyObjC.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), sys.path, and imported modules (pyobjc_setup).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations; primarily package configuration.",
  "flows": "The script modifies sys.path, then calls setup() to configure package installation, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual logic. The code appears to be standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package: adjusting sys.path, importing setup, defining package metadata, and calling setup(). There are no indications of data leakage, malicious network activity, or malicious code logic. The script adheres to typical Python packaging patterns and does not invoke any dangerous operations. All imported modules and functions are standard or well-known, and no untrusted input is processed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to configure package installation for the pyobjc framework on macOS. There are no signs of malware, suspicious data flows, or security vulnerabilities.",
