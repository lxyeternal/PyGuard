{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package wrapper for the macOS ExceptionHandling framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reading the file system for its directory path (os.path.dirname(__file__)), importing os and sys modules, importing setup from pyobjc_setup.",
  "targets": "No specific data sink or untrusted data handling present; no data processing or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup function is called with static parameters, no dynamic or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is a standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup and configuration, with no input/output, network activity, or data manipulation. It modifies sys.path, imports modules, and calls setup() with static arguments. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The overall structure and content are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup script for macOS PyObjC framework wrappers, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
