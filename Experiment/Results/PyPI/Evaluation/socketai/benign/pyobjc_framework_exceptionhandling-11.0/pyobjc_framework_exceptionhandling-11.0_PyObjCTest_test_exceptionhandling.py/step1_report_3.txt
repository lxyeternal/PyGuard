  "purpose": "Unit tests for the ExceptionHandling module, verifying class attributes and callable metadata integrity.",
  "sources": "import statements, especially 'import ExceptionHandling' and attribute access within test methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Importing ExceptionHandling module, then accessing attributes and methods for assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code appears to be standard test code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named ExceptionHandling and performs unit tests to verify the existence of a class and the sanity of callable metadata. There are no external data inputs, no network or system modifications, and no use of environment variables or insecure practices. The structure follows typical testing conventions, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely benign and intended for testing the wrapping of the ExceptionHandling framework.",
