{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite verifying attributes and behaviors of the ExceptionHandling module, likely for correctness and integrity.",
  "sources": "Imports from ExceptionHandling, access to its attributes, and invocation of its methods.",
  "targets": "Assertions on ExceptionHandling attributes and methods, with no external data input or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only inspects attributes and types within imported modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behaviors detected. The imports and assertions are standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a custom module ExceptionHandling and uses testing assertions to verify the existence of class attributes and their types. No untrusted input handling, network operations, or file manipulations are present. The code is structured as a typical unit test, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward test suite for the ExceptionHandling module. It performs standard attribute checks and type assertions with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It poses no security risks.",
