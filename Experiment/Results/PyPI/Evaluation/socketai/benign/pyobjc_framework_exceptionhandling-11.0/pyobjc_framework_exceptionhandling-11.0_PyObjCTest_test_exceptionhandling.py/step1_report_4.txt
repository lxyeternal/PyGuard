  "flows": "Import of ExceptionHandling -> Access of NSExceptionHandler attribute -> Check instance type.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. The code performs straightforward testing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks and the ExceptionHandling module, then performs attribute existence and type assertions on ExceptionHandling.NSExceptionHandler. These are standard unit tests. No data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code does not execute untrusted data or invoke unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for a Python module related to exception handling. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. It performs typical assertions to verify module attributes and types. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
