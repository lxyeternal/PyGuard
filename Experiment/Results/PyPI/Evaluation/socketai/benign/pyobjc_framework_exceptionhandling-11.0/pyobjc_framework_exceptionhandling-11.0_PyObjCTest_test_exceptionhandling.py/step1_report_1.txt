  "purpose": "Unit testing framework wrapping for ExceptionHandling module and objc classes.",
  "sources": "import statements (ExceptionHandling, objc, TestSupport), attribute access on ExceptionHandling",
  "sinks": "assertHasAttr, assertIsInstance, assertCallableMetadataIsSane (test assertions)",
  "flows": "import -> attribute access -> assertions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named ExceptionHandling and tests for specific attributes and class instances. It also tests callable metadata. All operations are standard test assertions. No data is read from external untrusted sources, nor is data sent elsewhere. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test script with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple test suite verifying the structure and attributes of the ExceptionHandling module and objc classes. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this code snippet.",
