{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up metadata, constants, and function definitions related to Objective-C exception handling and architecture-specific behavior, likely for a macOS or iOS environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`objc`, `sys`), environment checks (`sys.maxsize`, `objc.arch`), and the registerMetaDataForSelector function calls.",
  "sinks": "The registerMetaDataForSelector calls could be sensitive if they register malicious or unintended method metadata. No direct data leaks or malicious network actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment checks determine which functions are used (`sel32or64`, `selAorI`) based on system architecture, influencing subsequent method registration. Metadata registration flows through `registerMetaDataForSelector`.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code dynamically registers method metadata but does not perform any evident malicious actions. Use of magic constants and indirect metadata registration is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script configures Objective-C runtime metadata for exception handling. It adapts behavior based on system architecture and architecture type, registering selectors with specific argument and return types. The presence of constants, enums, and protocols indicates setup for exception handling routines. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation is observed. The code is structured and consistent with environment setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup for Objective-C exception handling, involving environment checks and metadata registration. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indications. Its purpose appears to be configuration rather than malicious activity.",
