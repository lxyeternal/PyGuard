{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be configuring Objective-C runtime metadata, exception handling, and related constants for an application, likely related to error handling or debugging.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (`sys.maxsize`, `objc.arch`), imports modules (`objc`, `sys`, `typing`), and accesses Objective-C runtime functions (`registerMetaDataForSelector`, `objc.informal_protocol`).",
  "sinks": "Calls to `registerMetaDataForSelector` with method names and argument types, which could potentially be misused if malicious inputs were injected, but in this context, they are hardcoded.",
  "flows": "System info determines which functions are defined; metadata registration functions are called to set up exception handling behaviors based on these conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious system calls detected. The code is purely for configuring runtime exception handling metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines selector functions based on system architecture and max size, then registers method metadata for exception handling, and defines a protocol with optional methods for exception handling delegation. All data and method names are hardcoded, with no input/output or external network interaction. The purpose aligns with standard Objective-C runtime setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for Objective-C exception handling metadata, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of an application's error handling configuration without any malicious or sabotage features.",
