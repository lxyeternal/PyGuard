  "purpose": "Configure Objective-C runtime exception handling metadata, protocols, and environment-dependent functions for cross-language interoperability.",
  "sources": "Metadata registration functions, environment checks, hardcoded constants and protocol definitions.",
  "sinks": "Metadata registration calls, protocol method definitions, environment-dependent function calls.",
  "flows": "Environment checks -> Metadata registration -> Protocol setup",
  "anomalies": "Use of architecture-dependent functions and constants; no external data or network activity; standard configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated Objective-C bridge module for exception handling, performing runtime registration of metadata and protocols. It uses environment checks for system architecture and registers selectors with associated metadata. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward setup for exception handling in a cross-language environment, with no signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for runtime configuration of exception handling metadata and protocols. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score should be very low (~0.1), reflecting its configuration nature.",
