{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up Objective-C metadata, define platform-specific functions, and register exception handling configurations in a Python environment that interfaces with Objective-C.",
  "sources": "Reads system architecture, Objective-C runtime information, and metadata registration functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to objc.registerMetaDataForSelector, objc._updatingMetadata, and potential delegation via NSExceptionHandlerDelegate.",
  "flows": "Reads system info and Objective-C runtime data -> registers metadata and protocols -> defines exception handling behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function names, or unusual code patterns. The code primarily performs legitimate setup tasks. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The script sets platform-dependent functions based on system architecture and CPU type, registers Objective-C method metadata, defines protocols for exception handling delegates, and updates exception masks. All actions are consistent with configuring exception handling in a mixed Python-Objective-C environment. No signs of malicious activity, hidden backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present. The code does not perform any network activity, data theft, or system modification beyond standard metadata registration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for Objective-C exception handling within a Python environment. It performs expected configuration tasks without any malicious intent or security risks.",
