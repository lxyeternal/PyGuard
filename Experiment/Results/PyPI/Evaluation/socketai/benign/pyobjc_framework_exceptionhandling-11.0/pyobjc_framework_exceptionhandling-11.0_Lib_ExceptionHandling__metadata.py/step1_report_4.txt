{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a system that sets up Objective-C exception handling and metadata registration, likely for debugging or crash reporting purposes within an application.",
  "sources": "Imports 'objc' and 'sys', reads system architecture info (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), retrieves metadata registration data, and defines protocols and expressions related to exception handling.",
  "sinks": "Metadata registration functions and protocol definitions that could influence exception handling behavior, but do not directly process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Imports sys and objc info -> defines platform-specific functions -> updates metadata registration -> defines protocols and expressions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code primarily registers method signatures and exception handling configurations without any dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard system and Objective-C bridge modules, defines platform-dependent functions, and registers method metadata for exception handling selectors. It also sets up informal protocols for exception handler delegates. The code appears to be configuration/setup code for exception handling, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors observed. There are no signs of data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The code seems legitimate for system or crash reporting purposes, and no anomalies or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup for Objective-C exception handling and protocol registration without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly configures exception handling behavior and metadata, typical in crash reporting or debugging tools.",
