  "purpose": "This module sets up the Python bindings for the macOS ExceptionHandling framework by dynamically creating directory and attribute access functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dynamic framework loading via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr, sys.modules manipulation",
  "sinks": "Assignment to globals()['__dir__'], globals()['__getattr__'], deletion of sys.modules entry",
  "flows": "Imports -> Framework setup functions -> Dynamic attribute creation -> Removal of module reference",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute creation with createFrameworkDirAndGetattr, deletion of internal sys.modules entry without clear purpose",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads and exposes the macOS ExceptionHandling framework functions by utilizing Objective-C bridging. It manipulates the global namespace to define __dir__ and __getattr__, enabling dynamic attribute access. The removal of the '_metadata' module from sys.modules appears to prevent re-imports, possibly for encapsulation or obfuscation. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or backdoors are evident. The code relies heavily on system frameworks and standard Python and Objective-C interop patterns, which are legitimate for this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for Python bindings to a system framework, using dynamic attribute and directory creation. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent, though the dynamic attribute handling could be misused in other contexts, but within this scope, it appears benign.",
