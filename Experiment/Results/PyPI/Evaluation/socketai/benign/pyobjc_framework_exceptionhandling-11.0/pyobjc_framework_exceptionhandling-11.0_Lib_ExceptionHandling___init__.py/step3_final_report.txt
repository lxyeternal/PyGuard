  "purpose": "Set up dynamic attribute accessors for the ExceptionHandling framework using Objective-C bridging functions.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, Foundation, objc, and _metadata; calls objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to generate __dir__ and __getattr__ functions.",
  "sinks": "Assigns generated functions to global __dir__ and __getattr__; deletes _metadata from sys.modules.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> creates framework functions -> assigns to globals -> deletes internal module.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic function creation and global namespace modification; deletes internal module _metadata after setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Objective-C bridging setup for a framework, dynamically creating attribute accessors and cleaning up internal modules. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The techniques used are typical in such context, though they can be misused elsewhere. The absence of error handling and the deletion of internal modules are noted but not malicious. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign purpose. Overall, the code is a legitimate framework initialization routine with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Objective-C bridging setup for the ExceptionHandling framework, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The dynamic function creation and cleanup are typical in such context, and the scores reflect a low security risk. It is safe to consider this code benign.",
