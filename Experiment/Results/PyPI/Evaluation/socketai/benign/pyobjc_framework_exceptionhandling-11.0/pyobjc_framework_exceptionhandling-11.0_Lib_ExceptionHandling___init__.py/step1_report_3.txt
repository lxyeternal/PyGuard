  "purpose": "Initialize and set up the ExceptionHandling framework by importing necessary modules and dynamically creating directory and attribute access functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`import sys`, `import Foundation`, `import objc`, and `from . import _metadata`) and the dynamic creation of `dir_func` and `getattr_func` using `objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr`.",
  "sinks": "Assigning `__dir__` and `__getattr__` to dynamically created functions; deletion of `_metadata` from `sys.modules`.",
  "flows": "Imports → dynamic function creation via `objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr` → assignment to globals → deletion of module from sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute and directory function creation; removal of `_metadata` module from `sys.modules`, which could potentially hide underlying module details or malicious modifications, though common in dynamic frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads a framework (`ExceptionHandling`) from a system path and creates custom directory and attribute access functions, assigning them to the module's globals. This is a standard pattern for wrapping Objective-C frameworks in Python. The removal of `_metadata` from `sys.modules` might be a way to prevent further access or tampering, but it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious code patterns are present. The purpose appears to be legitimate framework initialization with dynamic attribute handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard framework initialization and dynamic attribute management without signs of malicious intent. The removal of `_metadata` from `sys.modules` is unusual but not suspicious in this context. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
