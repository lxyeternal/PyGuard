  "purpose": "To initialize and set up the ExceptionHandling framework by dynamically creating directory and attribute getter functions for the framework, importing necessary modules, and cleaning up the module namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, Foundation, objc, and internal _metadata; dynamic function creation via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of dynamically created functions to globals (i.e., __dir__ and __getattr__); deletion of _metadata module from sys.modules.",
  "flows": "Imports -> creation of directory and attribute getter functions -> assignment to globals -> deletion of internal module from sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic function creation and modification of global namespace; removal of internal module from sys.modules without clear external trigger; no explicit input validation or error handling around dynamic attribute creation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports essential modules and utilizes objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to dynamically generate directory and attribute accessor functions for a framework. These functions are then assigned globally to enable dynamic attribute access. The internal _metadata module is then removed from sys.modules, which may be to prevent external access or for cleanup. There is no user input, network activity, or file writing present. The code relies heavily on objc's dynamic capabilities, which, while powerful, are common in Objective-C bridge code and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior are detected. The deletion of internal modules and dynamic global function creation could be misused in malicious contexts, but in this isolated snippet, they serve a legitimate purpose of framework setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate framework initialization routine that uses dynamic Objective-C bridge functions to set up accessors for a system framework. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The use of dynamic function creation and cleanup is somewhat unusual but not malicious in itself. Overall, this is a standard setup routine with low suspicion.",
