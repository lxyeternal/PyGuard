  "purpose": "Debugging helper for PyObjC that logs exceptions and stack traces, aiding in diagnosing crashes and exceptions during development.",
  "sources": "Exception objects (callStackSymbols, callStackReturnAddresses, userInfo), environment variables, system command outputs (atos, xcrun).",
  "sinks": "Logs via NSLog, system calls to resolve addresses into symbols, exception handling delegate methods.",
  "flows": "Exception attributes and system command outputs flow into logs; exception info is used to generate stack traces via external tools.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard debugging pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes system tools ('atos', 'xcrun') to translate memory addresses into human-readable symbols for stack traces, which is typical in debugging on macOS. Exception handling is explicit, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The exception handler delegates log exceptions and stack traces, with control over verbosity. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration observed. The external process invocation is controlled and based on environment detection. The potential for information leakage exists but is inherent in debugging tools; no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard debugging utility designed for exception logging and stack trace resolution in PyObjC applications. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk score (~0.2) are justified given its purpose. Overall, it is safe for use in development environments.",
