{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a setup and build configuration script for the PyObjC framework, handling environment detection, SDK configuration, test discovery, and build extension setup.",
  "sources": "System commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), SDK plist files, PKG-INFO, filesystem scans for test modules, environment variables for compiler and SDK paths.",
  "sinks": "System info collection via subprocess, filesystem reads, dynamic import of test modules, sys.path modifications, environment variable reliance.",
  "flows": "System commands and file reads provide system and SDK info; environment variables influence build configuration; dynamic module imports load tests based on filesystem patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code performs standard build and test setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script executes system commands to gather environment details, reads configuration files, modifies sys.path for test discovery, and sets up build extensions with platform-specific flags. All actions are typical for a build setup script. No malicious behavior, network activity, or backdoors are present. The code is transparent, well-structured, and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign build and test configuration script for PyObjC on macOS. It does not contain malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
