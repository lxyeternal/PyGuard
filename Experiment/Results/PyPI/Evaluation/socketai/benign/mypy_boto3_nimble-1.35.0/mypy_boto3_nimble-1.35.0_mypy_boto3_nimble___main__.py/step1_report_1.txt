{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entry point that outputs package information or version details for a Python package related to boto3.NimbleStudio.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Uses print() to output information to stdout; no untrusted data or external calls are involved.",
  "flows": "sys.argv is checked for '--version'; if present, print_version() is called, otherwise print_info() is called. The flow is straightforward and only outputs static or informational data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code only handles basic CLI input and prints static information.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines functions to print package info and version. The main() function checks for '--version' argument and calls the appropriate print function. No external network calls, data processing, or untrusted input handling occurs. The code is simple and static, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI script that outputs static package information and version. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
