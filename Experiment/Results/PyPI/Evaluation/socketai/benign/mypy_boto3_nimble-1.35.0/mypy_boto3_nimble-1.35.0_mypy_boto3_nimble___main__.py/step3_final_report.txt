{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or effects; the code only prints static information.",
  "flows": "The source (sys.argv) triggers a conditional check, leading to printing static strings; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs no unusual actions, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, and handles only static data.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line input. It imports only sys, checks for '--version' in sys.argv, and prints predefined static strings. It does not process untrusted input beyond command-line args, does not perform network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, simple, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are consistent with the code's behavior and are appropriate. No vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are justified and should remain at zero across all categories.",
  "confidence": 1,
