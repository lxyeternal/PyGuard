  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 NimbleStudio.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments)",
  "sinks": "print statements (outputs to stdout)",
  "flows": "User inputs '--version' -> main() function checks sys.argv -> calls print_version() -> outputs version info; otherwise, calls print_info() -> outputs package info",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. The code performs straightforward informational output functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs package details or version info based on command-line input. It uses standard Python libraries (sys and print). No external data inputs or untrusted sources are processed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns identified. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications. It is solely for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and serves only to display package information. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
