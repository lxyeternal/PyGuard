  "review": "Let's evaluate each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details.\n- It reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, checks for '--version', and prints corresponding static text.\n- There are no external network calls, data processing, or untrusted input handling beyond benign command-line arguments.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with clear separation of functions, and only performs informational output.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All consistently describe the code as a benign CLI script.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent are identified.\n- The analysis states that the code only prints static information and does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Any issues?**\n- No, all reports agree that the code is safe, with no security risks or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-checking the scores:\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is simple and clear.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code does not warrant any higher malware or risk scores.\n- The code is a benign utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, no external data, no vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, static CLI utility for displaying package info and version.\n- All reports are accurate; no adjustments needed.\n- The scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final note:** No further action required.",
