{
  "purpose": "The script provides CLI utilities to display package information and version details for the boto3 NimbleStudio stub package.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and prints static information to stdout.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the print() function which outputs package info or version details; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv (specifically '--version') flows into the conditional check which triggers a print of version info; otherwise, package info is printed. No other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code uses straightforward string literals and standard library functions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that responds to '--version' argument by printing version info, otherwise prints static package information. It uses standard Python functions and does not process untrusted input beyond command-line arguments, which are benign in this context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. No external network connections, no environment variable misuse, and no suspicious dynamic code execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign utility for displaying package metadata. It does not contain malicious code, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
