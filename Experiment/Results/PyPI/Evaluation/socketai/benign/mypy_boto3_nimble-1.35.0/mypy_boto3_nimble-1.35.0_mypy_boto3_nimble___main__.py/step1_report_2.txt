{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point that displays package information or version details.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs information through print statements.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is stdout via print, which outputs package info or version. No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input (sys.argv) -> Decision (if '--version') -> print_version() or print_info() -> stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward informational printing without any hidden or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to access command-line arguments. It defines functions to print package info and version. The main function checks for the '--version' argument and prints accordingly; otherwise, it prints package info. The script is invoked as a CLI tool. No external data sources, no data processing, no user input beyond command-line arguments, and no data sinks that could leak or manipulate data maliciously. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI script that displays package information and version. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended without any suspicious behavior.",
