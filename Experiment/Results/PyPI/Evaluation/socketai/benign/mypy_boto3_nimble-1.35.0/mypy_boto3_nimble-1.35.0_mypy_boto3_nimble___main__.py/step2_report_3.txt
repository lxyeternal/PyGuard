  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It reads `sys.argv` and prints predefined strings.\n   - No external network calls, data processing, or untrusted input handling beyond command-line args.\n   - No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, static, and straightforward.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The scoring of malware and security risk as zero aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the script.\n   - No need to adjust scores.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious or risky.\n   - No external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The code is entirely benign.\n   - No malicious intent, payload, or suspicious behavior.\n   - Malware score should be 0.\n\n6. **Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The code makes no assumptions; it simply outputs static info.\n   - No vulnerabilities are implied or present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n   - The overall assessment is that this is a safe, non-malicious utility.\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\n**Summary:**\nThis script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
