  "purpose": "CLI script to display package information and version details for boto3 NimbleStudio",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "targets": "Prints package info and version to stdout",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv (if '--version' present) leads to calling print_version(), otherwise calls print_info()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No external network connections or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that displays static information about the package. It only reads command-line arguments and prints predefined text. There are no dynamic code evaluations, external data fetching, or suspicious behaviors. The code structure is simple, with clear separation of functions, and no obfuscated or complex logic. It appears to serve a benign purpose with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks.",
