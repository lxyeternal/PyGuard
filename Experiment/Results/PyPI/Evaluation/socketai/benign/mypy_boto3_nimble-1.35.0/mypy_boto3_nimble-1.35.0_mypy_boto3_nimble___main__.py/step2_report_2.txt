  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line argument (`--version`).\n- It imports only `sys`.\n- It has no external network calls, no data processing, no user input beyond command-line args, and no dynamic code execution.\n- All outputs are static strings.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward, and all reports agree that it is benign and static.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security issues are detected.\n- The code does not handle untrusted input in a way that could cause harm.\n- No malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- None identified. The code is simple and correct for its purpose.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- Since the code only outputs static information and does not perform any malicious actions, scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or modify system state.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on static code review.\n- The code's purpose is purely informational, with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a benign CLI utility.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reported scores are accurate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the report accurately reflects the code's nature.",
