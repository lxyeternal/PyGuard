  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python library 'mypy-boto3-nimble'.",
  "sources": "Reads static README.md file; no untrusted input; static package metadata and URLs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Static data used for package configuration; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script that imports setuptools, reads a local README file, and calls setup() with static parameters. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling. Dependencies and URLs are legitimate. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the code's safe, static nature.",
