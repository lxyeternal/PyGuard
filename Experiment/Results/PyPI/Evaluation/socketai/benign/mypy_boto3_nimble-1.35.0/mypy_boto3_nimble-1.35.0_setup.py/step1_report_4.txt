  "purpose": "This setup script is for packaging and distributing the Python library 'mypy-boto3-nimble', providing metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, and static data for package configuration such as package data, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains data sinks that handle untrusted input, as it primarily defines static package metadata and configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script reads a file for description and uses static data for setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code appears to be a standard setup script with no suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a local README file for long description, and calls setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity is present. All data used in the script is hardcoded or read from a local file, with no external or untrusted input involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. It contains only static configuration data for packaging the library. No signs of malware or security risks were identified.",
