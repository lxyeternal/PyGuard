  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-nimble package, used for packaging and distributing the Python module.",
  "sources": "Path(__file__).parent / \"README.md\" for reading long description; setup() arguments for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no execution of untrusted data or commands.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md and passing static data into setup(), no dynamic or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The only dynamic operation is reading a static file for documentation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a well-known packaging library. It reads a README file to include as long description. The setup() function defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, URLs, and data files. No user input, network connections, or code execution based on untrusted data is present. The install_requires field specifies a version constraint for a dependency, which is standard practice. All data appears static and related to package setup. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python setup script for packaging a module, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious activity. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies, and securely reads a static README file.",
