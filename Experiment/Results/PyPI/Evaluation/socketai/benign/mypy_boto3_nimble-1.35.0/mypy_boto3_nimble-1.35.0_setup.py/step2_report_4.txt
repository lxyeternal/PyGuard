  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard Python setup script for packaging a library.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- The code reads a static README.md file, imports from setuptools, and calls setup() with static parameters.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** The code appears to be a typical setup.py script with no anomalies, errors, or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware presence:** No malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n- **Data flows:** All data is static or read from local files; no untrusted input is processed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the script only performs package setup.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n- The URLs and dependencies are legitimate.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the thorough analysis and consistent findings, I concur with the provided scores.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup script is benign, standard, and safe. No security concerns are present.",
