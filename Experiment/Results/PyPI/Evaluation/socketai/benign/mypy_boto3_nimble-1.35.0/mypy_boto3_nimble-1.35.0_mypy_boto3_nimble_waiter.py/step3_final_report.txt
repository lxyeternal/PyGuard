  "purpose": "Define custom waiter classes for AWS Nimble Studio SDK with type annotations and documentation.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as resource IDs (e.g., launchProfileId, studioId, sessionId, streamingImageId, etc.), passed into the wait methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external effects; parameters are identifiers only, with no data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into method signatures; no internal logic or data processing is present; methods only contain docstrings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Waiter with method signatures and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple subclasses of botocore.waiter.Waiter, each representing a specific AWS Nimble Studio waiter. Methods are only signatures with parameters for resource identifiers and optional WaiterConfig, accompanied by detailed docstrings referencing AWS documentation. There is no executable logic, data handling, or external effects. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and serves as a type-safe interface for SDK waiters. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a set of type-annotated SDK interface classes for AWS Nimble Studio waiters. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
