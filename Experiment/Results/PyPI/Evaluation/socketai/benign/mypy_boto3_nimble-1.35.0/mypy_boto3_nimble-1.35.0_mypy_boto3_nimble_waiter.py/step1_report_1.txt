{
  "purpose": "Define custom waiter classes for AWS Nimble Studio service to facilitate waiting for specific resource states.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'botocore.waiter' and '.type_defs' module; class method parameters accepting resource identifiers and optional waiter configuration.",
  "sinks": "Method calls on the Waiter base class, primarily for waiting on AWS resources, no untrusted data sinks or external effects present.",
  "flows": "Class method parameters (resource IDs and WaiterConfig) flow into 'wait' method calls on 'Waiter' instances; no external data flows or actions beyond standard AWS SDK calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated language, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow detected. The code strictly defines classes and methods with documented purpose, following standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom waiter classes inheriting from botocore's Waiter, with well-documented method signatures for resource waiting operations. It uses type annotations and conforms to expected patterns for AWS SDK extensions. No suspicious code, external network activity, or malicious behavior is present. All resource identifiers are passed as method parameters, with no hardcoded secrets or external data sources. The code appears to be a clean, boilerplate-like extension for AWS resource waiters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign extension defining waiter classes for AWS Nimble Studio resources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It solely serves to facilitate resource state polling via AWS SDK. Confidence is high that this code is safe and intended for legitimate use.",
