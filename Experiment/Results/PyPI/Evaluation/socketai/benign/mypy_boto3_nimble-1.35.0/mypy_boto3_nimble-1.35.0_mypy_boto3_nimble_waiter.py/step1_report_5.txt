  "purpose": "Define specialized waiters for the NimbleStudio AWS service with type annotations for use in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Waiter class and custom type definitions; class definitions with wait methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods that invoke the wait function, which could potentially process untrusted parameters if misused, but in this context, only type annotations and method signatures are present.",
  "flows": "Method calls such as wait() with parameters like IDs and optional WaiterConfig, which are type-annotated and passed to the parent class Waiter, with no dynamic execution or data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code solely consists of class definitions, method signatures, and docstrings referencing external documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class-based definitions for AWS Nimble Studio waiters, including method signatures with type annotations. It uses standard class inheritance from the Waiter class, with no dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity. The purpose appears to be to facilitate type-safe waiter usage. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of class definitions for waiters, primarily serving as a type-annotated interface. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are evident. It appears to be a benign, utility-focused module for AWS SDK usage.",
