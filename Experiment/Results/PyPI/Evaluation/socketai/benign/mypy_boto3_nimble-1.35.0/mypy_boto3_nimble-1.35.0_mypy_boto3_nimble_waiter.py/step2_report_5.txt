  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report finds no issues, highlighting that the code is a straightforward, boilerplate extension of AWS waiters with proper documentation and no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no external effects or secrets.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion appears accurate. The code is benign, purely defining class interfaces for waiters.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code only defines classes with method signatures and no actual logic or external data handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, considering the code's purpose.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence, but slightly less than Report 1 due to cautious language.\n- **Verdict:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is a standard pattern for AWS SDK extension.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code is a set of class definitions with type annotations, no dynamic logic, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no external effects.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — full confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Clear and accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the lack of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — aligns with the benign description.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — very high.\n- **Verdict:** The code is a benign, type-annotated interface for AWS waiters.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also notes that the code is a class-based, type-annotated set of waiters with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, considering the code's utility nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — full confidence.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports agree that the code is purely defining class interfaces with no logic or external effects.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, justifiably minimal, given the nature of the code.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High across all reports, with some variation due to cautious wording.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward class definitions.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0 — the code is purely declarative, with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-documented set of custom waiter classes for AWS Nimble Studio, serving as type-safe wrappers. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The reported scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
