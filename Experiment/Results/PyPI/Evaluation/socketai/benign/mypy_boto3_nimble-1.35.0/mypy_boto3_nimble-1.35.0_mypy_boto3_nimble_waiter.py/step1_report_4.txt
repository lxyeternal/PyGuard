{
  "purpose": "Define custom waiters for AWS Nimble Studio service with type annotations for improved type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, method signatures, imports, and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (e.g., IDs and configurations) are passed to wait() methods but are only used as parameters for AWS SDK calls, not processed insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or unusual behaviors detected. The code strictly defines classes and methods with documented purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured set of waiter classes inheriting from boto3's Waiter, each with a wait() method accepting specific parameters and optional configurations. All functions are docstring-documented and do not execute any logic beyond method signatures. No external data sources, network connections, or secret handling occurs. The code appears to be purely for type annotations and API convenience, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type-annotated wrapper classes for AWS Nimble Studio waiters, aimed at improving developer experience and type safety. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks identified. It is a benign, documentation-focused code module.",
