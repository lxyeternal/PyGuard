  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logical consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code defines custom waiter classes inheriting from `botocore.waiter.Waiter`, with methods that accept resource identifiers and optional `WaiterConfig`. It emphasizes the absence of malicious behavior, external network activity, or data leaks. The confidence is high (1), and malware risk is 0.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The code is straightforward class definitions with well-documented `wait` methods, no obfuscation, and no suspicious logic. The resource IDs are passed as parameters, and no hardcoded secrets or external effects are present.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code content. The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code provides type-safe interfaces for AWS Nimble Studio waiters, with no evidence of malicious activity. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still high, and malware risk is 0.1, indicating minimal concern.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The code only defines classes and method signatures, with no implementation logic or external interactions. The parameters are resource IDs and optional configurations, which are standard. The report correctly notes the absence of suspicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Potential Concern:** The slight security risk score (0.1) might be due to the fact that the methods accept untrusted parameters, but this is typical for such interfaces and not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; the code is benign. The malware score remains at 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on the code being purely declarative, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or malicious code. The confidence is high (1.0), and malware risk is 0.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The code consists of class definitions inheriting from `Waiter`, with method signatures and documentation. No dynamic execution, data leaks, or obfuscation are present.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, highlighting that the code provides type annotations and class definitions for AWS waiters, with no malicious behavior. Confidence is high (0.95), malware risk is 0.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The code is purely declarative, with no execution logic beyond method signatures. No suspicious patterns or external effects are detected.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code content. The risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code defines class-based waiters with type annotations, no dynamic code, and no malicious behavior. The confidence is 1.0, and the malware risk is 0.1, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The code is consistent with a utility module for AWS SDK, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The note about potential processing of untrusted parameters is standard and not indicative of a security issue.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code defines a set of waiter classes inheriting from `botocore.waiter.Waiter`, with method signatures accepting resource identifiers and optional configurations. The implementation is only in the form of method signatures and docstrings; actual logic is inherited.\n\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow are present in the code snippets.\n\n- **Security Risks:** The minimal risk scores (mostly 0, some 0.1) are appropriate, given that parameters are resource IDs and configurations, typical for SDK wrapper classes.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** All scores are reasonable. The slightly elevated security risk scores (0.1) reflect the fact that the methods accept untrusted parameters, but this is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the code is purely class and method signatures with no executable logic or external effects, the malware score should remain at **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and well-documented. The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is benign and only provides type annotations and class definitions, the overall risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Aspect             | Suggested Score | Justification                                                 |\n|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | **0**           | No malicious behavior, code is declarative and safe.          |\n| Obfuscated         | **0**           | Clear, standard class definitions with documentation.          |\n| Overall Risk       | **0**           | No security risks identified; code is a benign SDK wrapper.   |\n\nThis aligns with all the reports' assessments and the code content.",
