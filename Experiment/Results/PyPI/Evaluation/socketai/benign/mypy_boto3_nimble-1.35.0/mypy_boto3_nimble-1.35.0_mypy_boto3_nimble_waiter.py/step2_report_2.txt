  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom waiter classes inheriting from botocore's Waiter, with detailed documentation and standard method signatures. No suspicious or malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is boilerplate, well-documented, and follows expected patterns. No external effects, data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues, safe, and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on type safety and interface clarity. No evidence of malicious code, external network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** All parameters are resource identifiers passed into the wait methods; no internal logic or data processing shown. The code is purely declarative.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — **Security risk is minimal but present due to parameter acceptance.** However, since no actual logic or external effects are shown, this is acceptable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely type annotations, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar class definitions with detailed type annotations. No dynamic code, network activity, or secrets.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely declarative, serving as an interface for AWS waiters. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK wrapper.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern: class definitions, method signatures, no suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** No external effects, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — **Correct.**\n\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, documentation-focused.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on type annotations and interface clarity. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The methods only define signatures and docstrings; no internal logic or external effects.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — **Acceptable, given the minimal security risk.**\n\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (0.1), justified by the acceptance of resource IDs and optional configurations, but no actual security vulnerability or external effect is present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature: purely declarative, type-annotated classes for AWS waiters.\n\n- No changes needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — Very low, given the code's benign purpose; the minor risk score of 0.1 in some reports is acceptable but could be slightly lowered to reflect the minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-documented set of AWS SDK waiter class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
