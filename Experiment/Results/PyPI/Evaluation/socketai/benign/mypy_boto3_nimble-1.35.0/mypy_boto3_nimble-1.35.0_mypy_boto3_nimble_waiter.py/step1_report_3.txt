{
  "purpose": "Define custom waiters for the Nimble service client with detailed type annotations for better type safety and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.waiter, local type_defs module, class method parameters, and default argument assignments.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data handling, external data transmission, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow is primarily class definitions with method signatures; no actual data flow or execution logic beyond method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code consists of class definitions, docstrings, and method signatures only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple subclasses of Waiter, each with a wait method that accepts specific parameters and optional WaiterConfig. These classes serve as type-safe interfaces to wait for certain Nimble service events. The code imports necessary modules and declares all waiter classes in __all__, facilitating modular import. There are no dynamic executions, external network calls, or data handling beyond method signatures. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured set of class definitions providing typed waiters for the Nimble AWS service. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The implementation is purely declarative, with no runtime execution logic or external interactions.",
