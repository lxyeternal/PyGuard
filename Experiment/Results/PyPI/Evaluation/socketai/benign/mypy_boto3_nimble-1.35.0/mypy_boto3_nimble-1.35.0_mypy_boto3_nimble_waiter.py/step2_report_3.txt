  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasonableness of the scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom waiter classes inheriting from botocore's Waiter, with method signatures, documentation links, and no apparent malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — purely boilerplate class definitions, no security concern.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high, the analysis aligns with the code.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed explanation about method parameters, class structure, and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, perhaps considering that parameters are untrusted inputs, but no actual processing occurs.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is purely declarative, with no malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on type safety and documentation, with no execution logic or external effects.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — benign, purely type annotations.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the code is for type annotations and documentation, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard set of class definitions for waiters, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — considering that parameters could be misused if misused, but the code itself is safe.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly 0, with a few at 0.1, reflecting minimal concern due to untrusted parameters, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 for all, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** Should stay at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code is purely declarative and follows standard patterns, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. The minor 0.1 scores are acceptable but could be uniformly set to 0 to reflect the benign nature more clearly.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, safe extension of AWS SDK waiters, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate; the code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal risk scores are reasonable but could be standardized to zero for clarity.",
