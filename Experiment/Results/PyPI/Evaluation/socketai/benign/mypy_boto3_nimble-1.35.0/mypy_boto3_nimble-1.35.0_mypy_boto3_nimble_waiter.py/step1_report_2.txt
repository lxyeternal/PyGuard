  "purpose": "Define custom waiters for the NimbleStudio AWS service client with type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'botocore.waiter' and local 'type_defs' module; class method parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'wait' methods, which accept untrusted parameters such as IDs and optional WaiterConfig; no data leaks or network calls are explicitly shown in the code.",
  "flows": "User code calls 'client.get_waiter' to obtain waiter instances, then invokes 'wait' with parameters (e.g., IDs, WaiterConfig). No internal flows are present as implementations are inherited from Waiter and not shown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be straightforward class definitions with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several waiter classes inheriting from 'Waiter', each with a 'wait' method accepting parameters related to AWS resources (IDs, studio ID, stream ID) and an optional WaiterConfig. These methods only contain docstrings referencing AWS documentation; implementations are inherited and not shown. No data processing, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The structure and format follow standard Python class and method conventions. The code is clearly structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The import statements are standard, and there are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of well-structured type-annotated class definitions for AWS NimbleStudio waiters, serving as an interface for waiting on resource states. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is benign and aligned with typical SDK wrapper patterns.",
