{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for various data structures used in a Nimble service SDK, primarily for input validation and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "No input sources or external data reads; the code consists solely of type definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems; no functions, network calls, or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code contains only type definitions and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; the code uses standard type annotation patterns with conditional imports for compatibility, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of TypedDict definitions for a service SDK, with conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions. It does not execute any logic or perform any data processing, and there are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. All imports and definitions are static, and the code appears to be purely for type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It is a straightforward set of type definitions used to specify data structures for the Nimble service SDK. The code is benign and serves only a developmental purpose.",
