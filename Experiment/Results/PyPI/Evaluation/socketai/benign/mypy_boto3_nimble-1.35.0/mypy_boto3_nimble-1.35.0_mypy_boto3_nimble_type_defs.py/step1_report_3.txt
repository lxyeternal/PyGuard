{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations for Nimble service type definitions to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input mainly from type annotation definitions and imported literals; no untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations are present; code strictly defines data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as this code is solely for type definitions and does not include runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code strictly adheres to type annotation definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The script provides extensive type definitions using TypedDict and Union, intended for type safety in a Python SDK for Nimble. It conditionally imports typing extensions based on Python version. All elements are data structures with no executable logic or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a purely structural, type annotation module for Nimble service SDK, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for type safety and documentation support.",
