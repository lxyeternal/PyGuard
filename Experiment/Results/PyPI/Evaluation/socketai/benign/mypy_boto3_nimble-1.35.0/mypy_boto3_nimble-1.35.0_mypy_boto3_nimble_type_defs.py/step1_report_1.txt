  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for Nimble service in AWS SDK, providing typed dicts for API request and response payloads.",
  "sources": "Type definitions for API requests and responses, imported literals, and type annotations from standard and external libraries.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted input or perform security-sensitive actions; primarily data structure declarations.",
  "flows": "Definitions of data payloads for API calls, responses, and internal configurations. No dynamic execution or data processing flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. Use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of TypedDict and Union definitions for request and response payloads in a Python AWS SDK context. It imports standard modules and typing extensions conditionally based on Python version, which is a common practice for compatibility. There are no runtime code executions, network calls, or security-critical operations. The structure is typical for type hints, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be purely declarative and focused on data validation and documentation support.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only data structure definitions for the Nimble SDK, with no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It is a standard type annotations module for API payloads, with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
