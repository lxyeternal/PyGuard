  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims and ensure consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states that the code provides type annotations and data structures for Nimble SDK, sourced from type definitions, literals, and standard libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic or runtime data handling, just static data schemas.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard for compatibility.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is purely declarative, with no malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on API data schemas for Nimble.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or runtime logic.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a standard type definitions module, safe and static.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malware or security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for Nimble SDK, with no runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Purely structural, safe, and standard.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a benign set of type hints.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, type definitions for Nimble SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime or external data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, purely for type annotations.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of TypedDict, Union, and constant definitions for API request/response schemas.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of runtime logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns, a risk score of 0.0-0.1 is more accurate than 0.5. The current reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a static, declarative module providing type annotations for an SDK.\n- No runtime code, no external data handling, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The use of conditional imports for Python version compatibility is standard practice.\n- The extensive type definitions are typical for SDKs to facilitate static type checking and documentation.\n\n**Therefore, my overall estimate is:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or at most 0.1, but 0 is appropriate here)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; the code is safe, and there are no security concerns.",
