{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for Nimble service in AWS SDK, primarily used for type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definitions, and constant imports from literals modules, as well as the use of sys.version_info to conditionally import typing extensions.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines types and constants without executing external data flows or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative and does not handle runtime data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, no backdoors, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution observed. The code relies solely on static type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict definitions for structured data used within the AWS Nimble service SDK. It imports type extensions conditionally based on Python version, which is standard for maintaining compatibility. No functions, network calls, or data processing logic are present. There are no signs of malicious code such as hidden backdoors, code injection, or malicious data handling. The code appears to be a standard type definitions module designed to facilitate static type checking and improve developer experience.",
  "conclusion": "This code is safe and purely declarative, serving as type annotations for the Nimble service SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is typical of SDKs that rely on static type hints to aid development, with no indication of sabotage or malware.",
