  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for Nimble service type definitions used for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, datetime, typing, and local literals; type definitions for request/response data structures using TypedDict.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; primarily static type definitions and data schemas.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines types and constants without runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive type definitions, but no suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. No backdoors, network operations, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of import statements and TypedDict definitions for various request and response types related to Nimble service. All structures appear to be standard data schemas with optional fields specified using NotRequired. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard for compatibility. No signs of malware, malicious code, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a collection of type annotations and data schemas for Nimble service API interactions. It contains no executable or runtime logic that could be malicious. The code is well-structured, standard, and appears solely designed for type safety and clarity in API communication.",
