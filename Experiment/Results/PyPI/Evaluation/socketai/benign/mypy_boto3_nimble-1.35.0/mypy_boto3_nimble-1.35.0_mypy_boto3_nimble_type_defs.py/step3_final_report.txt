  "purpose": "Type annotations for Nimble SDK request and response data structures, providing static type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; only static type definitions and literals imported from local modules and standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, runtime logic, or external data handling; purely static data schemas.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; definitions serve as static type annotations for API payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDict, Union, and Literal definitions for API request/response schemas, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable logic, network calls, or data handling. The use of standard practices indicates a benign, declarative purpose for static type checking and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, purely structural module for type annotations with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. It is safe and benign, serving as a foundation for SDK type safety.",
