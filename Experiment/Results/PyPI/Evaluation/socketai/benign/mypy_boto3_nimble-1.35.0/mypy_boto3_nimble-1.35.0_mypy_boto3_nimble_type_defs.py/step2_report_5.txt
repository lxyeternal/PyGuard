  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations for Nimble SDK, with no dynamic or runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No handling of untrusted data or dynamic flows; purely data schemas.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Conclusion:** Only data structure definitions, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, with no security risks or malware. The confidence is high (1).  \n**Malware score:** 0, **Obfuscated:** 0, **Risk:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of untrusted data handling or runtime logic.  \n- Highlights standard practices and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is just type definitions, with no malicious patterns. The high confidence (1) is justified.  \n**Malware score:** 0, **Obfuscated:** 0, **Risk:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the lack of suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- Notes the code's static nature and purpose for type safety.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the previous findings, the code is a straightforward set of type annotations. No malicious indicators.  \n**Malware score:** 0, **Obfuscated:** 0, **Risk:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Reiterates that the code is purely for type annotations, with no runtime logic or external data handling.  \n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code's structure. The confidence is high, and no malware or security risks are evident.  \n**Malware score:** 0, **Obfuscated:** 0, **Risk:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Emphasizes the static, benign nature of the code, with no data flows or malicious patterns.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion is consistent with the code's purpose and implementation. No concerns for malware or obfuscation.  \n**Malware score:** 0, **Obfuscated:** 0, **Risk:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code consists solely of static type definitions for the Nimble SDK, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Security & Malware:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Behavior & Flow:** No runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for API request/response schemas. It is purely declarative, with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
