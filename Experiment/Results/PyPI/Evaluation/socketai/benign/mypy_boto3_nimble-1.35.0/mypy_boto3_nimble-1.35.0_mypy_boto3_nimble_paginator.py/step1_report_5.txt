{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the Nimble service client in boto3-stubs, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class method parameters and return types; docstrings referencing external documentation.",
  "sinks": "Paginate methods returning _PageIterator, which yields response type definitions; no sinks perform untrusted data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (e.g., PaginationConfig, identifiers) flow into paginate methods, which produce _PageIterator objects; no external data or untrusted sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes for the Nimble AWS service, each with a paginate method annotated to return a generic _PageIterator over specific response types. The classes and methods follow standard typing conventions, include helpful docstrings referencing documentation, and do not perform any network, file, or system modifications. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The structure and content appear consistent with well-formed, type-annotated interface code for paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-annotated set of paginator classes for the Nimble service, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed for type safety and clarity in SDK usage, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
