  "purpose": "Type annotations for Nimble service client paginators, defining interfaces and method signatures for pagination operations.",
  "sources": "Method parameters within each paginator class, such as 'studioId', 'eulaIds', 'PaginationConfig', etc., which are input arguments for the 'paginate' methods.",
  "sinks": "Return values of 'paginate' methods, which are iterator objects (_PageIterator) yielding response data; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'paginate' methods; the methods return iterator objects that produce paginated response data, with no external data flows or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; the code strictly consists of class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type annotations and class structures for AWS Nimble SDK paginators, following standard SDK patterns. It contains no dynamic execution, network communication, or obfuscation. The parameters are typical for SDK interface definitions, and the return types are iterator classes designed for paginated responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to best practices for type safety and interface clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type annotations and class definitions for AWS Nimble SDK paginators. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
