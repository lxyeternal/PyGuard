  "purpose": "Type annotations for Nimble service client paginators to facilitate static type checking and IDE assistance.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals, imported modules, function parameters, and class inheritance.",
  "sinks": "Methods like 'paginate' where untrusted input could influence data retrieval parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., studioId, eulaIds, etc.) flow into 'paginate' methods which return paginated responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code primarily consists of type annotations and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines generic paginator classes with type annotations for each method. It references external documentation links for clarity. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data leaks are present within the provided snippet. The code serves as a type-safe wrapper for AWS Nimble SDK paginators, with standard patterns and no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and wrapper classes for AWS SDK paginators, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
