  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its purpose, and the given scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is standard type annotations for Nimble SDK paginators, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, focusing on type annotations and class definitions. No issues or anomalies are present.  \n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Defines type annotations and paginator classes for Nimble, with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code is purely type annotation and interface definitions. No malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- **Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with focus on class definitions and type hints, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward SDK interface code, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Emphasizes that the code only involves type annotations and parameters, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code is static type definitions, not executable logic.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code defines paginator classes with type annotations, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly interprets the code as a standard SDK interface with no malicious intent.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, dynamic execution, or external communication.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear, well-structured, and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that this is benign SDK interface code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely type annotations and class definitions for paginators, following standard patterns.\n- No dynamic or external code, no secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior are present.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThe reports are accurate and justified.
