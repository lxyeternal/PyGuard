{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginators for the Nimble service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Function parameters within paginate methods, including input arguments like studioId, eulaIds, PaginationConfig, etc.",
  "sinks": "Return values of paginate methods, which are _PageIterator objects yielding response type definitions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into paginate methods, which produce iterators over response data; no data flows into untrusted sources or external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; code is standard boto3 paginator interface implementation. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports beyond typical type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for paginator classes and their paginate methods, with clear parameter definitions and return types. It imports necessary types and defines generic classes for iterators. The structure is consistent with boto3 paginator patterns and contains no suspicious logic, data handling, or external communication. No indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation layer for Nimble client paginators in boto3, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply enhances type safety and documentation for paginator usage.",
