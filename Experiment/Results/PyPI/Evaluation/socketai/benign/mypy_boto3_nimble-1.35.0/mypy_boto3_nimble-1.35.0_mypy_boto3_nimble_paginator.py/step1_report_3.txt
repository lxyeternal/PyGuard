{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the Nimble service client to facilitate paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Class methods (paginate) reading parameters such as studioId, eulaIds, launchProfileId, etc., and returning iterator objects.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods return _PageIterator objects which yield response type definitions; no direct untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to paginate methods flow into _PageIterator return objects; the code structure is straightforward and does not process or execute data from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code mainly defines classes, methods, and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code provides typed paginator classes for the Nimble AWS service, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious behaviors. It strictly defines interfaces and method signatures, with no evidence of malicious logic. The use of TypeVar and generic classes appears standard. No suspicious external calls or data leaks are observed. The code is well-structured, with clear docstrings and annotations, indicating typical SDK interface design.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, non-malicious SDK interface definition for paginators, with no signs of malware or security risks. It solely defines paginator classes and type hints for paginated responses, adhering to expected patterns.",
