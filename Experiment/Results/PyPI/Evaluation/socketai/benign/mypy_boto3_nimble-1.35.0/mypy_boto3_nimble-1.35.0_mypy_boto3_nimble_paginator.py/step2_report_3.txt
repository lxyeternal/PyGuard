  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the described issues with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on type annotations for Nimble paginators, based on class definitions, method signatures, and external documentation links.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is purely type annotations and class structures.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clearly standard, well-structured, and safe. Confidence is high (1). No malware or security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on type annotations and paginator definitions, with parameters and return types.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious code, dynamic execution, or suspicious imports. The code is a straightforward type annotation layer.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-structured, standard, and safe. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report accurately describes the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, defining paginator classes with type annotations, focusing on parameters and return types.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, no external network calls, no obfuscation, just interface definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard SDK interface pattern, safe. Confidence slightly below 1 (0.95), but still very high.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for paginator classes, parameters, and return types.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no dynamic execution, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, standard pattern. Confidence is 1.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focusing on class definitions, parameters, and return types.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, no external calls, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-formed, safe, and standard. Confidence is 1.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is purely type annotations and class interfaces for AWS SDK paginators.\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** None observed. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard patterns.\n- **Scores review:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0, which are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0 or very low, matching the benign assessment.\n- **Malware justification:** Since no malicious activity, dynamic code, or suspicious behavior is present, malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Assumptions & claims:** All claims are based on static analysis and documentation references, which are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is purely type annotations and class definitions for paginators, with no dynamic code, no external communication, no secrets, and no malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a standard, safe, and well-structured set of type annotations for AWS Nimble SDK paginators, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
