{
  "purpose": "Type annotations for Nimble service client paginators to enable static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Function parameters in 'paginate' methods, especially untrusted inputs such as 'studioId', 'eulaIds', 'launchProfileId', 'studioId', 'owner', 'sessionIds', 'createdBy', 'types', 'states', 'principalId', and 'PaginationConfig'.",
  "sinks": "Return of '_PageIterator' which yields paginated response types; no direct data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are passed to 'paginate' methods; these are used internally by the paginator to fetch pages, but the code does not show the internal logic, only type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code strictly defines type annotations and method signatures. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for paginator classes used in the boto3 Nimble client. It specifies the expected parameters and return types, including untrusted input parameters such as identifiers and configuration options. No actual data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations are implemented in this code. It is purely a type definition module with no executable logic that could be malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code adheres to standard patterns for typing and documentation, serving as a static type checker aid.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type annotations for boto3 paginators with no malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines interface contracts for paginating through AWS Nimble resources.",
