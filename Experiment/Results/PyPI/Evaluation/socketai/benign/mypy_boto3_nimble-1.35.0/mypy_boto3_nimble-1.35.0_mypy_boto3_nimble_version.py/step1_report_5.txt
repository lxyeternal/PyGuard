  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, which is a common practice for package versioning. There are no input reads, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations. The content is minimal and straightforward, indicating a typical version declaration without any malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
