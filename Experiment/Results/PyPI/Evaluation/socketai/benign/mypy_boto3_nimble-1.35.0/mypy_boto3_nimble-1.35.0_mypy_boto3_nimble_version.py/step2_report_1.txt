  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code simply assigns a static string `\"1.35.0\"` to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, dynamic code execution, external data processing, or obfuscation present.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard practices for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No reports indicate any signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The content is consistent across all reports, emphasizing benignity.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Risks or Assumptions**:\n   - Since the code is static and does not involve any external input or dynamic behavior, there are no grounds to assume any vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n   - The high confidence scores (all 1) are justified.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a typical version declaration, with no security concerns.\n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risk present.\n\n**Estimated scores based on the entire review**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus that the code is benign and purely serves as a version indicator.",
