  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = \"1.35.0\"",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no input or data flows beyond version assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version assignment with a comment",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a static version string to __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The comment suggests this is a source of truth for versioning, with no external input or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a version identifier without any malicious or security-related concerns.",
