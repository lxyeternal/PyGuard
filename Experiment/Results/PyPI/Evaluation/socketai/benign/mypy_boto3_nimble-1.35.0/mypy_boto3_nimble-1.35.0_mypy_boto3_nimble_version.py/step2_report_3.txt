  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing.\n   - The code is minimal, with no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no security concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments are that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a static version assignment.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the absence of any malicious or suspicious elements, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
