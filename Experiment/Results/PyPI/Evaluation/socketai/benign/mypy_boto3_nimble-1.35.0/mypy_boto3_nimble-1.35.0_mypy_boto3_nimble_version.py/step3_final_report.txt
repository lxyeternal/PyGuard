  "purpose": "Declare the version of the package, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__ variable; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a simple static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common and benign pattern in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, or external dependencies are involved. All reports correctly identify this as a simple, non-malicious version declaration. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present. The code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version string declaration with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate and consistent; no modifications are necessary.",
