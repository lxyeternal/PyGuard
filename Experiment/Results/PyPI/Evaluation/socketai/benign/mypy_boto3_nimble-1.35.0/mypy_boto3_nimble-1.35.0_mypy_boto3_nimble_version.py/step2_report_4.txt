  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.35.0\"\n```\nThis is a straightforward, static assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable, a common pattern in Python packages.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Findings:**\n- All reports confirm that the code is a simple, static version assignment.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code, or external inputs are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The comments and analysis consistently state the code is benign and standard.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's simplicity.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The conclusions that the code is benign and poses no security risks are justified.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- The risk score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security issues.\n\n6. **Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign `malware`: 0.\n- This is correct; the code is just a version string assignment with no malicious intent.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n8. **Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n- The code is a minimal, static version declaration.\n- No security issues, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and appropriate. The code is benign, and there are no security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
