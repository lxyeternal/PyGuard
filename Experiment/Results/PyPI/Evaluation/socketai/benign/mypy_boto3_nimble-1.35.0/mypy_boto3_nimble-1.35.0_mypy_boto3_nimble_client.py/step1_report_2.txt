{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the Nimble Studio AWS service, facilitating static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definitions, method signatures, property accessors, and docstrings within the class and module.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types that could potentially accept or output untrusted data, e.g., resource identifiers, tokens, and configuration data.",
  "flows": "Method inputs such as resource IDs, tokens, and configuration objects flow into API calls; return types provide data back to callers. No evidence of data being sent elsewhere or manipulated maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code consists solely of type annotations, method signatures, and docstrings. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or file manipulations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for AWS Nimble Studio with type annotations, overloads for pagination and waiters, and structured docstrings linking to official documentation. It primarily serves as a static type hinting interface. No code appears to perform runtime logic, data processing, or external communications that could be malicious. The structure is consistent with a type stubs or API interface definition, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type annotation and interface definition for the Nimble Studio AWS SDK client. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is likely auto-generated or manually maintained type stub code intended for static analysis and IDE support only.",
