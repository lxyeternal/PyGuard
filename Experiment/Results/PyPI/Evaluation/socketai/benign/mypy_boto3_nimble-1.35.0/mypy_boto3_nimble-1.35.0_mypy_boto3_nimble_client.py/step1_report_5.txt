  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the NimbleStudio AWS SDK client, facilitating static type checking and IDE autocompletion for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and method definitions, type annotations, string literals, and property declarations within the NimbleStudioClient class.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters accepting untrusted input (e.g., resource ARNs, IDs, tokens), especially in methods that generate URLs, modify resources, or accept user-provided data.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as resource identifiers, tokens, and configuration parameters flow through API method calls, potentially affecting resource management, URL generation, and data retrieval. The flow is typical for SDK clients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code constructs are present. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated code features are detected. The code mostly consists of standard SDK interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a strongly-typed Python class for the NimbleStudio AWS client, including method signatures, overloads for paginators and waiters, and exception classes. It imports necessary types and defines the interface with detailed type annotations. The code appears to be a standard, auto-generated SDK stub for static type checking. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observed. It does not perform any data manipulation, network operations, or code execution; it only describes interface structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured type stub for the NimbleStudio AWS SDK client. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or sabotage. It is purely for type checking and documentation purposes, with no executable malicious behavior.",
