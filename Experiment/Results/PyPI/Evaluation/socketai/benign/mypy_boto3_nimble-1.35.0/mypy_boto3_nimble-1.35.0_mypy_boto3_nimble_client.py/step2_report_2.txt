  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: code content, potential vulnerabilities, anomalies, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a type annotation and interface declaration for the NimbleStudio client, with no executable logic.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious data flow, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The report confidently states the code is safe, with malware score 0, obfuscated 0, and risk 0. This aligns with the static, purely declarative nature of the code.\n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static type annotations and client interface definitions.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No evidence of malicious activity; no dynamic code or external calls.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Appropriately assigns malware score 0, obfuscated 0, and risk 0.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Again, a type stub/interface for the SDK, with detailed method signatures.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Correctly indicates no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Same as previous, a static interface with type annotations.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is negligible.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to others—type stub/interface for SDK.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0, matching the static nature.\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, type annotation/interface layer for the AWS Nimble Studio SDK.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the absence of executable logic, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Security Risk:** Appropriately 0 across all reports.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High, as the code is purely declarative.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Scores:** No adjustments needed; all are consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Additional Comments:** The code appears to be auto-generated or manually maintained type stub code, serving static analysis and IDE support purposes only. No malicious or obfuscated activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk, purely type annotations)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
