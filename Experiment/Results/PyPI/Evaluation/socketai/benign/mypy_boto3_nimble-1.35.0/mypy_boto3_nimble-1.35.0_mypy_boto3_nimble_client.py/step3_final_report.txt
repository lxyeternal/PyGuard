{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations and interface definitions for the NimbleStudio AWS SDK client, primarily intended for static analysis, IDE autocompletion, and type checking.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, class definitions, and import statements defining the SDK interface; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Parameters and return types in method signatures; no actual data processing, network calls, or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Method parameters serve as sources; return types are data sinks; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; code is purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and interface definitions for the NimbleStudio client, with no executable logic or data manipulation. It includes method signatures, overloads, and documentation links, serving as a static stub for IDE support. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's structure and content are consistent with auto-generated SDK interface definitions, and the absence of runtime code or network activity indicates a low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious, static interface stub for the NimbleStudio SDK, with no obfuscation or security concerns. It is intended solely for static analysis and IDE support, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
