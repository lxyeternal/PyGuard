{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and class interface for the NimbleStudio client to facilitate type checking and IDE support for the AWS Nimble Studio SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library, typing, botocore, and local module files; class definitions; method signatures and property declarations.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types; particularly input parameters that accept untrusted data, such as 'Params', 'tags', 'resourceArn', 'clientToken', 'operation_name', and various identifiers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method input parameters (sources) through SDK method implementations (sinks), but actual data processing is not implemented here; only type signatures are defined.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious control flow are present. The code is purely type annotation and interface declaration. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'NimbleStudioClient' inheriting from 'BaseClient', with method signatures corresponding to AWS SDK operations, and overloads for paginators and waiters. All code consists of type annotations, method signatures, and property declarations for SDK interface. No executable logic, data processing, or external code execution occurs. The code is static and for type checking purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a purely declarative interface with type annotations for the Nimble Studio SDK. It contains no executable or malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a safe, type-focused stub definition for SDK client interactions.",
