  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states it's a type annotation and interface for NimbleStudio client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Focused on method signatures and data flow, with no actual logic.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is purely static, for type checking.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely declarative, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just a type stub/interface.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also describes class and method signatures, overloads, and type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard SDK interface definition.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on the interface and type hints, with no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar observations: interface definitions, method signatures, no executable code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, supply chain attack, or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is a static, type annotation-heavy interface or stub for the NimbleStudio SDK.\n- **Behavior & Logic:** No executable logic, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Purpose:** Likely auto-generated or manually maintained type stubs for IDE support and static analysis.\n- **Security Risks:** None apparent; purely declarative.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent across all reports; no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding techniques observed)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the complete lack of executable logic or suspicious features, the risk score should be **very low**, close to 0.\n\n### Justification:\nThe code is a static interface with type annotations, meant for static analysis and IDE autocompletion. It does not perform any runtime actions, does not handle untrusted data in a way that could lead to execution of malicious code, and contains no obfuscated or hidden behaviors.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to potential misuse of parameters if used maliciously, but no actual malicious code present)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis supply chain report is accurate. The code is a safe, standard SDK interface stub with no malicious or obfuscated content. The high confidence levels in the reports align with this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that actual runtime code, if present elsewhere, is also reviewed. This particular snippet is purely a static interface definition.",
