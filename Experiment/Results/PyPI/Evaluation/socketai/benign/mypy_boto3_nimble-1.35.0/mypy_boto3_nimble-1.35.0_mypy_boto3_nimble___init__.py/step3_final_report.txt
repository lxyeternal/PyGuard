{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an organizational module that imports and re-exports classes and functions related to AWS Nimble Studio SDK components, facilitating easier access for users.",
  "sources": "Static imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter), class alias assignment, and the __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class assignments are static; no data flows or dynamic execution are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and standard for SDK setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that imports classes and functions from internal submodules, assigns an alias for the client class, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. The inline usage example is purely documentation. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The code's purpose is organizational, serving as an SDK interface. All indicators point to benign, standard code with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns. The analysis and scores are consistent with this assessment.",
