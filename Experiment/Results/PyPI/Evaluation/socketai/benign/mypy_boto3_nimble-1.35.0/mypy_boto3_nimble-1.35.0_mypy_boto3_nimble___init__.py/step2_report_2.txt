  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states the code is a standard SDK interface with static imports and no dynamic behavior.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing or external communication.  \n- **Anomalies:** None detected; code is static and standard.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The review correctly identifies this as a benign, standard SDK module with no malicious or security issues.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. All reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static imports, no data flow, no anomalies.  \n- **Conclusion:** Properly identifies the code as a straightforward SDK interface with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Also describes the code as a static import and re-export module with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is benign and standard.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same pattern: static imports, no data handling, no anomalies.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Consistent with previous reports, emphasizing the static and straightforward nature of the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected in any report.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None present. All code is straightforward static imports and re-exports.  \n- **Security risk:** Given the absence of dynamic code, data handling, or network operations, the risk is effectively zero.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated:** Confirmed as **0**; no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** Should be **0** as well, reflecting no security threat.\n\n**Note:** All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is a standard SDK interface module with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code provided.",
