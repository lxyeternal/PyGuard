  "purpose": "This code defines and exports a module interface for interacting with the Nimble Studio service, providing access to various waiters and paginators for managing resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and the inline example code demonstrating usage of the client.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules and defining aliases and __all__ exports; no dynamic data flow or untrusted input processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The example code is standard usage documentation. The module simply re-exports classes and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of imports, class and function definitions, and setting up module exports. It does not include any data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. All components are from local modules related to the SDK's structure. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, backdoors, or hidden functionality. The inline usage example is standard documentation for a client library. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward SDK interface setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module that exports classes and functions for interacting with the Nimble Studio SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks. It is safe for use.",
