  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment of all reports:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** All reports indicate that the code is purely an SDK interface module, consisting of static imports, class assignments, and exports. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code does not handle untrusted inputs or perform any operations that could be malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns:** None of the reports detect obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard SDK module conventions.\n\n- **Malware or malicious intent:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, and their analysis confirms the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Security risks:** The reports assign a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the absence of security concerns.\n\n- **Anomalies or errors:** No anomalies, errors, or logical flaws are identified. The code is consistent, well-structured, and typical for an SDK interface.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n\n- The malware score is **0** across all reports, justified by the lack of any malicious or suspicious code.\n\n- The obfuscated score is **0**, consistent with the static, clear structure.\n\n- The security risk score is **0**, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or insecure practices.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, static code)\n- **Risk:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe and serves solely as an organizational layer for AWS Nimble Studio SDK components.",
