  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports uniformly describe the code as a straightforward SDK interface module, primarily involving static imports, class aliasing, and re-exports. They note no dynamic behavior, data processing, or network operations. Based on the provided code, there are no indications of issues such as code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is static, standard, and contains no suspicious patterns. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.  \n   **Conclusion**: No errors or flaws in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with their analysis. The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty. These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.  \n   **Suggestion**: No changes needed; the scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports suggest any behavior that would warrant a higher risk score. The code is purely for SDK setup, with no network, data handling, or execution of untrusted code.  \n   **Conclusion**: Risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the analysis. The code does not exhibit any malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n   **Conclusion**: Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports are cautious and base their conclusions on static analysis, with no assumptions about hidden behaviors. They correctly interpret the code as benign.  \n   **Conclusion**: No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency with the Reports**:  \n   The scores align with the detailed reasoning. Given the code's nature, the scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall Justification**:  \nThe code is a standard SDK interface module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis code is safe, well-structured, and contains no security risks. The assigned scores reflect this assessment accurately.",
