  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports classes from internal files and re-exports them, serving as an SDK interface.\n- No dynamic code, network operations, or untrusted data handling are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is static, organized, and typical for SDK module setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and findings:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code simply imports classes and functions from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter), assigns a class alias, and defines `__all__`. The inline example is just documentation, not executable code.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No input handling, no network or file operations, no code execution, no secrets.\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, all assign 0 or very low, which is appropriate.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?** No, all are at 0, which is justified.\n- **Malware scores?** Correctly 0 in all reports.\n- **Claims based on assumptions?** No, all reports avoid assumptions and base their analysis on static code review.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My own conclusion:\n\nGiven the static, straightforward nature of this code, I concur with the reports. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** This code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no security concerns.",
