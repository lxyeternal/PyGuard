  "purpose": "Define type literals for Nimble service string constants used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for various string-based enums and constants, and conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data inputs or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines constants and types without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward and consists solely of type annotations and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up string literal types for various Nimble service-related constants to facilitate type safety in Python. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version. All definitions are static, hardcoded string literals with no dynamic or executable code, and no data handling or external interactions are present. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation are detected. The structure is clear and consistent, serving as type definitions for SDK or client code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe and standard set of type annotations for a Python SDK, with no malicious intent or security risks. It only defines string literal types for better code correctness and clarity.",
