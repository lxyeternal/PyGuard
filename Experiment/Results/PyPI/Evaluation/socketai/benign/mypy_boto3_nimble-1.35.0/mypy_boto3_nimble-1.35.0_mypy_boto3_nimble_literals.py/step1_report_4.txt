  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for various string-based enumerations used in the Nimble Studio service SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing extensions; type definitions for string literals",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only defines type literals and does not process data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code consists solely of static type alias definitions for literals",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to conditionally import 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple string literal types for various service-specific enums. No input, output, or data processing is present. The literals are static definitions for type annotations, intended for SDK type checking and documentation. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The structure and content appear to be standard SDK type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static type definition module for Python type annotations. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious or obfuscated code, and no security risks. It serves as a type hints repository for SDK use, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
