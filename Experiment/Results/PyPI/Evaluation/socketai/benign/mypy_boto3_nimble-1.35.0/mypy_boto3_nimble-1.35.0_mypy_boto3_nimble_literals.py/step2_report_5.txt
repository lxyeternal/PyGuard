  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code in detail:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nThe code is a straightforward collection of type alias definitions using `Literal` for various string constants related to AWS Nimble Studio and other AWS services. It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version and then defines many type aliases with static string literals.  \n**No issues are present**; the code is purely declarative and static.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports consistently identify the code as benign, purely for type safety, with no dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious code.  \n**No logical errors or flaws** are evident in the reports. They correctly interpret the purpose and structure of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.  \n**These scores seem reasonable** given the static, declarative nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code contains no runtime logic, no data processing, and no external dependencies or inputs, the risk score should be **close to zero**. The reports' scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or dynamic execution.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports base their conclusions on the static, well-defined nature of the code, with no assumptions of malicious intent. This is appropriate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis: all recognize the code as safe, static, and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain **0**. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain **0**. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be **very low**, ideally **<0.1**, given the static nature and purpose.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThis code is a standard type declaration module for static analysis and documentation, with no runtime behavior, external data, or security concerns. The detailed reviews support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Value | Justification                                                      |\n|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score      | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present                               |\n| Obfuscated Score   | 0                 | Clear, static, non-obfuscated definitions                          |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1 (or very close to 0) | No vulnerabilities or malicious intent; purely declarative code |\n\n**Final note:** The existing scores (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0) are appropriate and should be maintained.",
