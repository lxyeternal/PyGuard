{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various identifiers used in the Nimble Studio service, including waiters, resource names, regions, and status codes, to improve type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, constant string definitions for literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; this file solely defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely assigns string literals to type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward type alias definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines numerous string literal types for various identifiers related to the Nimble service. The structure is consistent and clear, serving as type annotations for better static analysis. No external input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type alias definitions for string literals used in a Python SDK or type stub. It appears to be purely declarative and intended for type safety. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malware signals are detected. It is safe to use.",
