  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using `Literal` for various string constants.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, external input, or runtime behavior is present.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version is standard practice.\n- All literals are predefined, well-known identifiers relevant to AWS Nimble Studio and other AWS services.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n**2. Logical, reasoning, or summary flaws:**\n- The reports uniformly describe the code as straightforward, static, and benign.\n- They correctly identify that the code only declares type aliases for static string literals.\n- No misinterpretations or logical flaws are evident in the summaries.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe summaries are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**3. Evaluation of scores assigned to each report:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the purely declarative nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (1.0 or 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n**4. Justification for any higher risk scores:**\n- The code is purely static type alias definitions.\n- No runtime behavior, data handling, or external interactions.\n- No signs of backdoors, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` is standard and not suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo justification exists for increasing risk scores above 0.5.\n\n---\n\n**5. Malicious or suspicious claims:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is factual.\n\n**6. Consistency of scores with the code:**\n- The scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- Confidence scores are high, reflecting the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is clear, static, and well-structured.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type alias definitions for static string literals used in the AWS Nimble SDK. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Recommended scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
