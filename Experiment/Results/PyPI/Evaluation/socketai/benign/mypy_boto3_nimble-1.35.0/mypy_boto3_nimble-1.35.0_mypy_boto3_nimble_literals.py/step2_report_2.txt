  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the claims are justified, if the scores are appropriate, and what the overall security implications are.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as static type alias definitions using Python's `Literal` for various string constants related to AWS Nimble Studio and other AWS services.\n- The code is straightforward, with conditional imports for `Literal` based on Python version.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, external input, or network activity is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are evident.\n- The purpose is purely for type safety, documentation, and static analysis support.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with proper use of `Literal`.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Data flow:** No data processing or external input/output.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code is purely declarative.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Justification |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0     | Pure type alias definitions; no malicious or obfuscated code. |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0     | Static constants for AWS resource names; no security concerns. |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0     | Type aliases for identifiers; no vulnerabilities. |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0     | Simple static type definitions; no malicious intent. |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0     | Standard type annotations; no security risks. |\n\n**All reports** correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The code is **not** obfuscated.\n- There are **no signs of malware**, such as malicious code execution, secret exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The **risk level** is minimal; the code is purely declarative.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a standard, benign type stub for static type checking.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the purpose of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured set of type alias definitions for static analysis in the AWS Nimble SDK. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The current scores are accurate and appropriate.",
