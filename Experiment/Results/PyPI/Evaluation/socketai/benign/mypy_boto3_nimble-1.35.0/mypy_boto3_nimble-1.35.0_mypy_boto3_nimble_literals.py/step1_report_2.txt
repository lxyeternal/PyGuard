{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS Nimble Studio related constants and other AWS service identifiers, to ensure type safety and consistency in client code.",
  "sources": "Read-only string literals used to define specific constant values; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely declares type annotations with static string literals.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected. No obfuscated code, code injection, or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a static type definition module, primarily importing 'Literal' conditionally and defining numerous type aliases for AWS resource names, statuses, and identifiers. No dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data processing occurs. All literals are well-defined and serve for static type checking only. The structure is typical for type hint modules and contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static type declaration module for AWS Nimble Studio and other AWS service constants. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and its purpose is purely to enhance type safety in client applications. No security threats or malware are present.",
