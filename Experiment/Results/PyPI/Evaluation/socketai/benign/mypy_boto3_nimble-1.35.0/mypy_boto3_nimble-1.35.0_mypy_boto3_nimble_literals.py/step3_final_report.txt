  "purpose": "Type annotations for nimble service literal definitions.",
  "sources": "Static string literals defining various AWS Nimble Studio and related service identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains only static type alias definitions without data flow or external input.",
  "flows": "None; purely static declarations.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard conditional import of Literal based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal for various string constants. It conditionally imports Literal depending on Python version, which is standard. No dynamic code, data processing, external input, or runtime behavior exists. The literals are well-defined identifiers for AWS Nimble Studio and other services. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, secrets, or backdoors are present. The purpose is purely for type safety, documentation, and static analysis support. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions for static analysis and documentation purposes. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation or malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
