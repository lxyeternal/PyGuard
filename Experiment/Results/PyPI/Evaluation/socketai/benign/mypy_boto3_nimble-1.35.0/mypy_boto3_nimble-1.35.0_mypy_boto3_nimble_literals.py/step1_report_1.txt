  "purpose": "Define Python type aliases for various string literal types used in the Nimble service SDK, facilitating type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "The source code primarily reads static string literals for type annotations and imports from the 'typing' and 'typing_extensions' modules. No external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or potentially leaks; the code only declares type aliases with static string values.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative, establishing type aliases for consistent use across the SDK.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains conditional import based on Python version, which is standard practice. All string literals appear to be predefined valid identifiers for service configurations, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on the Python version, then declares multiple type aliases using 'Literal' with predefined string values. These aliases are used for type annotations elsewhere in the SDK. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious modifications. The extensive list of string literals represents valid configuration options, regions, and service names, with no indications of malicious intent or harmful code. The module is purely for type safety and documentation support, with no runtime behavior or external data dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for static string literals used in the AWS Nimble SDK. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is standard and benign.",
