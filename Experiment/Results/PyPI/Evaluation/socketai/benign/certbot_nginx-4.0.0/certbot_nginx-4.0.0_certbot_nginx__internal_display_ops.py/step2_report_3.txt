  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides CLI UI functions to select multiple VirtualHost objects.\n- Uses external display utility (`display_util.checklist`) for user interaction.\n- Maps user-selected display strings back to VirtualHost objects via string comparison.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The functions are standard for CLI-based selection processes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- **Presence of malicious code or vulnerabilities:** None. The code is straightforward UI logic.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code depends on external display utilities, which are assumed to be safe.\n- **Input handling:** User input is via a standard CLI prompt; no untrusted data processing beyond that.\n- **Data leakage or backdoors:** No evidence.\n- **Malicious activity:** Not observed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with no security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the report scores:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** UI for selecting vhosts, standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar UI function.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, but the reasoning is that user input influences which vhosts are selected. Since no malicious behavior is detected, this seems overstated.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** Reduce `securityRisk` to 0, as there's no actual security risk identified. The process is standard CLI interaction.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- Same analysis as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — again, minimal; the code is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** Lower `securityRisk` to 0, as no security issues are present.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- Similar to previous reports.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — the code is just UI handling.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- Same as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Malware and obfuscated scores:\n- All reports correctly assign malware as 0, consistent with the code.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward CLI UI component.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk code is present.\n- Slight overestimation of security risk in some reports; I recommend lowering those to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate in their analysis, but some overstate the security risk. The code is benign, standard CLI UI logic, with no malware or obfuscation.",
