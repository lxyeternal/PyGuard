  "purpose": "Provides UI methods for selecting Nginx virtual hosts to modify, specifically for certificate installation.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via display_util.checklist and virtual host display representations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; user input influences which vhosts are selected and returned.",
  "flows": "User input from display_util.checklist determines selected vhosts, which are mapped back from display representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. Usage of display_util.checklist is standard for CLI interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates user interaction to select multiple virtual hosts for SSL certificate installation. It constructs display strings for each vhost, then uses a display utility to present a checklist to the user. The user's selections are mapped back to actual vhost objects through string comparison. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or covert channels. The functions depend on external display utilities, which are common in CLI tools. No untrusted data is processed insecurely, and no hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical user interface component for selecting items from a list. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its design appears safe and standard for CLI applications.",
