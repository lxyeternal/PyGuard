  "purpose": "Provides UI methods for selecting Nginx virtual hosts for certificate installation.",
  "sources": "Reads vhosts parameter in select_vhost_multiple; reads user input via display_util.checklist.",
  "sinks": "Uses display_util.checklist to receive user input, which influences selected vhosts.",
  "flows": "User input from display_util.checklist determines which vhosts are returned; display representation functions are called for matching.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. Usage of display_util appears standard; no unusual or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for presenting a list of virtual hosts to a user and selecting multiple entries. It uses safe, external display utilities to get user input, which influences the flow. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code operates in a typical manner for UI selection; it does not process untrusted data in an unsafe way. All data flows are limited to user input and display functions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard UI selection logic for Nginx virtual hosts without any malicious intent or malicious code. It does not pose security risks based on the provided snippet.",
