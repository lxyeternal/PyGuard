{
  "purpose": "The code provides UI methods for selecting multiple Nginx VirtualHosts to install or modify SSL certificates, facilitating user interaction in a command-line environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via display_util.checklist and reads display representations of VirtualHost objects.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data externally; it only processes input and internal data structures.",
  "flows": "User selection input (names) flows from display_util.checklist back into _reversemap_vhosts to map string selections to VirtualHost objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code structures. The code relies on external display_util for input, which is typical for CLI interfaces. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates user selection of VirtualHosts with no external or hidden data leaks. It processes user input and maps it internally to objects. There are no suspicious behaviors or malicious intent. The code uses external libraries for UI, and no untrusted data is used in dangerous contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a CLI interface for VirtualHost selection without malicious intent or security issues. It only reads user input and performs internal object mapping, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
