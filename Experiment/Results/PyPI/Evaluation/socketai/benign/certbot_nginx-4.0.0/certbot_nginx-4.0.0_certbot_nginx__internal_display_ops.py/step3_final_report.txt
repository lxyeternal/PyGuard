  "purpose": "Provides CLI UI methods for selecting multiple VirtualHost objects for SSL certificate installation.",
  "sources": "User input via display_util.checklist, display_repr() method of VirtualHost objects.",
  "sinks": "Mapping of display strings back to VirtualHost objects in _reversemap_vhosts.",
  "flows": "User selects options via display_util.checklist -> display strings are matched with display_repr() outputs -> _reversemap_vhosts maps selections back to VirtualHost objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string comparison with display_repr() for mapping, which could be problematic if display_repr() outputs are not unique or change. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface for selecting VirtualHosts, relying on display representations for display and mapping. No external code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The string matching approach is standard but could be fragile if display_repr() outputs are not unique. External display utilities are assumed safe. No vulnerabilities or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI UI component for VirtualHost selection with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should reflect zero malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to reliance on external utilities and string matching, which are typical in such contexts.",
