  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Provides UI methods for selecting multiple VirtualHost objects.\n- Uses `display_util.checklist` to prompt user selections.\n- Maps user-selected display strings back to VirtualHost objects via `_reversemap_vhosts`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.\n- External display utility functions are standard for CLI interactions.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Reports**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: UI for selecting Vhosts for SSL installation.  \n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, standard use of display utilities.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly identifies the code as a typical CLI selection interface with no malicious elements.  \n- The logic is straightforward, and no issues are apparent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: UI for selecting Vhosts for certificate installation.  \n- Findings: No suspicious code, no obfuscated code, standard external display utility usage.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (slightly elevated, perhaps due to the user input handling)  \n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior.  \n- The security risk score is slightly higher but still low, considering the code only handles user input for selection.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: UI for selecting VirtualHosts for SSL certificates.  \n- Findings: No malicious code, no data leaks, standard CLI interaction.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.1 (minimal)  \n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with the code's logic.  \n- No concerns about malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: UI for selecting VirtualHosts for certificate installation.  \n- Findings: No suspicious behavior, no obfuscated code, standard library usage.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Accurate; the code is a typical CLI selection helper.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: UI for selecting Nginx virtual hosts.  \n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no data leaks, standard UI prompts.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Security risk: 0  \n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Correct; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation in the security risk score (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the code's nature as a CLI UI component.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** The reports consistently interpret the code as standard CLI UI logic, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to user input handling, which is standard)  \n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The code is a benign CLI interface for selecting VirtualHosts, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature. No changes are necessary. The code remains a safe, standard UI component with no malicious or security concerns.",
