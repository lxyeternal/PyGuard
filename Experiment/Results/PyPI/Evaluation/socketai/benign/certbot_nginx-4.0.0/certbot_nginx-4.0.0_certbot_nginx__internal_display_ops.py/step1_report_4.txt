{
  "purpose": "Provides UI methods for selecting Nginx VirtualHosts to perform operations such as certificate installation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'vhosts' parameter (list of VirtualHost objects), and user input via display_util.checklist.",
  "sinks": "Uses the display_util.checklist function which likely involves user interaction; no unsafe data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Source: 'vhosts' parameter and user input from display_util.checklist → Processing functions (_reversemap_vhosts) to map selected names back to VirtualHost objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Usage of standard library and external modules appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for presenting a list of VirtualHosts to the user and mapping selected names back to objects. It relies on external 'display_util.checklist' for user interaction, which is typical for CLI prompts. The _reversemap_vhosts function performs straightforward string comparisons to map selected names to VirtualHost objects, with no signs of malicious manipulation. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious activities are evident. No suspicious or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard UI component for selecting Nginx VirtualHosts with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages user selections and object mapping with no evident malicious behavior or sabotage.",
