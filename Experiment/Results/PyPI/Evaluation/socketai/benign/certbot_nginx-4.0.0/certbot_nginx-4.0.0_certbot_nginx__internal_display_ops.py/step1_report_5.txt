  "purpose": "UI methods for selecting Nginx virtual hosts for certificate installation",
  "sources": "User input via display_util.checklist (interactive prompt), vhost.display_repr() for string representation of virtual hosts",
  "sinks": "Mapping of user-selected strings back to VirtualHost objects, potentially influencing which vhosts are modified",
  "flows": "User interacts with the checklist, selecting hostnames; these are matched back to VirtualHost objects for further processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code or backdoors, no suspicious network activity or data leaks detected. Use of display utilities is standard for UI prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code provides user interface functions for selecting virtual hosts. It displays a list of host representations and processes user selections to map back to objects. All data flows involve display prompts and string comparisons; no untrusted input handling beyond user interaction. No malicious or maliciously intended code is detected. No obfuscated code or malware signatures present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard UI helper for host selection, with no malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies. It relies on trusted display utilities and performs straightforward data handling.",
