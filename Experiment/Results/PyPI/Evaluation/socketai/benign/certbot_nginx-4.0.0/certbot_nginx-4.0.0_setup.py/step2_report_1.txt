  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with static configuration data.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- Entry points refer to known plugin classes within the package, which is typical.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or anomalies are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** No issues; standard setup script.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Slightly more detailed, noting that entry points could invoke external code, but still benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or suspicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — possibly due to the entry point registration, but this is standard for plugins.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Note:** The small security risk score is acceptable, as plugin registration could potentially invoke external code, but nothing suspicious is present here.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard setup, no anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Standard, straightforward setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of issues:** None detected.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** No; all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** Correctly assigned as 0.\n- **Security risk:** Appropriately low, given the static configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a typical setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and does not warrant any concern.",
