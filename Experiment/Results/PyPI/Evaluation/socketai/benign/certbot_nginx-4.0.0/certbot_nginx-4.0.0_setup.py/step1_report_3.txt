  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the certbot-nginx plugin package, including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions, imported functions, package data, dependency lists, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution points during package installation or import, especially the entry points 'certbot.plugins' which could invoke external code.",
  "flows": "During package installation or plugin activation, the setup process loads the specified configurator class from the certbot_nginx module.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated sections. The code uses standard setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration script, importing setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. The 'entry_points' section points to a known class within the certbot_nginx package, which is a legitimate plugin component. No data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or malicious actions. It strictly defines package installation parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows common packaging practices without any anomalies.",
