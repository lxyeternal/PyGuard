  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package 'certbot-nginx' including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Constants (version), dependency specifications, package metadata, and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies, package setup, and entry point registration.",
  "flows": "Source constants and dependency strings are used during package setup to define requirements and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. Use of string formatting for dependencies is normal and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses standard 'setuptools' methods to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It specifies minimal and well-documented dependencies, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or file manipulations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward, typical for a setup script, and adheres to best practices. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and contains no malicious behavior. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points in a typical manner without any suspicious or malicious code.",
