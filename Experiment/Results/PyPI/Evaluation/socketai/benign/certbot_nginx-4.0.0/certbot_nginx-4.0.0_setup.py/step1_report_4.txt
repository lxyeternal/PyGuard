  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'certbot-nginx' Python package, defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points for plugin registration.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, variable definitions for version and dependencies, setup() function parameters including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted input handling or data processing that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; configuration values are static or predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; code appears standard for a package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points without any dynamic or untrusted input handling. All dependencies and parameters are hardcoded, and no network or system calls are made. The purpose is to package a plugin for Certbot with no indication of malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is typical for packaging and distribution purposes.",
