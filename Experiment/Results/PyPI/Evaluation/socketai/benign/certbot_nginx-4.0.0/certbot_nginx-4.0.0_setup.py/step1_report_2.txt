  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'certbot-nginx' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies ('install_requires', 'test_extras'), and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted data, user input, or external commands.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes package configuration data; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code strictly adheres to standard setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines dependencies and metadata, and configures package installation parameters. It uses static data and standard practices without dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network interactions. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as code injection or data exfiltration, are evident. The code appears to serve as a conventional setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, following standard packaging conventions without malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware indicators are detected.",
