  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a configuration module that sets platform-specific constants, static SSL hash lists, and simple functions.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, or network activity.\n- The SSL hashes are static, likely for integrity verification.\n- The function `os_constant()` only retrieves predefined constants.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:** Benign configuration setup, OS detection, static SSL hashes, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.  \n- The risk score is very low, which is appropriate given the benign purpose.  \n- Malware score is 0, consistent with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring seems reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on configuration constants, static hashes, OS detection.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected.  \n- The risk score is zero, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:** Same as above, static configuration, no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No issues identified; static hashes and OS detection are standard practices.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:** Similar configuration constants, static hash list, no dynamic code or secrets.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Slightly higher risk score (0.2) perhaps due to the presence of static hash lists, but these are standard for integrity checks.  \n- Malware remains 0, which is correct.  \n- Confidence is slightly below 1, which is reasonable given the static nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score is slightly elevated but still reasonable. No malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:** Same pattern—static constants, OS detection, hash lists, no suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with the code's benign purpose.  \n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as expected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable given the static hashes and configuration code. These do not indicate security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 1, with a couple at 0.9, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Estimated scores for the code:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (very low, standard configuration code with static hash lists for integrity verification)\n\nThe code appears to be a benign configuration module with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports' evaluations are consistent with the code's actual content. No changes are necessary. The overall security posture of this code is benign, with minimal risk.",
