  "purpose": "Configuration constants for nginx platform detection and SSL integrity verification.",
  "sources": "Platform.system() call for OS detection; static hash lists for SSL configs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; static constants used internally.",
  "flows": "OS detection leads to path assignment; static hashes used for integrity checks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static data and straightforward functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines OS-specific paths and static SSL hash lists, with a simple function retrieving constants. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated patterns are present. The static hashes are typical for integrity verification, not malicious. The OS detection logic is standard and safe. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain compromise are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, configuration-oriented, with static data and platform detection. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The static hash lists serve standard integrity purposes. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign intent.",
