  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration defaults for the nginx plugin, including OS-specific paths and SSL options.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call for OS detection; hardcoded string constants; list of SSL hashes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution; no user input or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "The only flow is from platform.system() to set the server root path based on detected OS.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The list of SSL hashes is extensive but appears to be for integrity checks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets OS-specific constants and defines static configurations. It uses platform.system() to determine the OS and assign paths accordingly, which is standard. The SSL hashes are static and likely used for verifying SSL configuration files. No dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or suspicious network activity is present. The function os_constant() simply retrieves values from a predefined dictionary without any risky behavior. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration utility for an nginx plugin. It does not contain any malware, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The extensive list of SSL hashes is used for integrity verification and does not pose security risks.",
