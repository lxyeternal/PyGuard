  "purpose": "Define constants and configurations related to nginx server setup and SSL options, including platform-specific paths and SSL hash lists.",
  "sources": "Reads platform.system() to determine OS, imports from platform and typing modules, and accesses predefined constants and lists.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is written to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "Determination of 'server_root_tmp' flows from platform.system() output to CLI_DEFAULTS['server_root'].",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; SSL hash list is static, but this is standard for checksum verification. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants, configuration file names, and platform-specific paths for nginx. It uses platform.system() to select appropriate directory paths, which is standard practice. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are detected. The SSL hashes are static and likely for integrity verification, which is normal. No data leaks, code injections, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration module for nginx-related settings, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
