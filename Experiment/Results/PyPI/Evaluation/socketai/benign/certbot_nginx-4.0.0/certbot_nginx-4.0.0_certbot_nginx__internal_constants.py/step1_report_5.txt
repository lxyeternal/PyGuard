  "purpose": "Define constants and configurations for managing nginx server setups, SSL options, and related security settings.",
  "sources": "Reads platform.system() for OS detection; reads predefined constants and hashes; accesses module-level variables and functions for configuration.",
  "sinks": "None of the variables or functions write or execute untrusted input directly. No external data sources or sinks appear to process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "OS detection influences which server root path is set; static data and constants are used for SSL configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The hash list contains multiple SHA256 hashes, possibly for integrity verification but no malicious use is evident. The function os_constant() is straightforward and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines static constants, performs OS detection for configuration purposes, and maintains lists of hashes for SSL configurations. It does not include any code that executes external commands, reads untrusted input, or manipulates data in an insecure manner. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The presence of hash lists suggests integrity verification, which is a common security practice. Overall, the code appears to serve a configuration purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration module for nginx and SSL options, with no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It performs OS detection, maintains hash lists, and defines constants securely. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
