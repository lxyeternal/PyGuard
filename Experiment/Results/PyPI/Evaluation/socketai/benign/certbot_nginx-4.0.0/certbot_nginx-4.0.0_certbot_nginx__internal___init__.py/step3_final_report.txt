  "purpose": "Analysis of Certbot nginx plugin internal implementation, focusing on SSL certificate management and configuration handling.",
  "sources": "Configuration files, system commands, network interactions, environment variables, and plugin routines.",
  "sinks": "System configurations, network connections, and system commands that could potentially leak data or alter system state.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as configuration files or environment variables flow into system commands and configuration routines, with outputs affecting system state and network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors detected in descriptions or comments.",
  "analysis": "All reports are based on descriptive summaries or comments, with no actual code snippets provided. The assessments correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security anomalies. The malware scores are consistently zero, and the security risk scores are very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting typical plugin behavior. Confidence levels vary appropriately based on the amount of information, with higher confidence for detailed descriptions and lower for minimal comments. The reasoning aligns with the lack of suspicious indicators, and the scores are justified accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The code described appears to be standard, safe plugin implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores and zero malware scores are appropriate. Overall, the dependency is deemed secure based on the provided descriptions, and no adjustments are necessary.",
