  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for resource resolution and subprocess management, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external binary, which is outside the scope of this code review. The risk score is moderate (~0.3), reflecting potential supply chain concerns but no active malicious activity."
