  "purpose": "Standard namespace package extension in Python to support multiple directories contributing to a package namespace.",
  "sources": "The import of 'pkgutil' via __import__ and the use of __path__ and __name__ attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or write data.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> extend __path__ with __path__ and __name__",
  "anomalies": "None; minimal, straightforward code using standard Python idioms.",
  "analysis": "The code is a common pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python, dynamically importing 'pkgutil' and extending __path__. No untrusted data, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of __import__ with a static string is safe. The code is not obfuscated and performs a benign operation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for namespace package extension with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and analysis are consistent and appropriate.",
