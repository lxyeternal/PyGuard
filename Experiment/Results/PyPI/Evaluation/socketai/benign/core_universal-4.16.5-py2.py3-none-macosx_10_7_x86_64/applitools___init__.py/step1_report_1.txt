  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ for package namespace management",
  "sources": "Accesses the __path__ variable and imports pkgutil to extend it",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Uses __import__('pkgutil') to call extend_path on __path__",
  "anomalies": "Standard usage of pkgutil.extend_path; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkgutil module and calls extend_path to extend the __path__ attribute of the package, which is a common pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No sensitive data or external network interactions are present. The code is straightforward and typical for package namespace extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace package extension without any malicious intent or security risks.",
