{
  "purpose": "This code imports a future feature for compatibility and initializes an instance of SDKServer, likely for SDK functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__ and local module import (.server). No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of SDKServer object; if SDKServer executes untrusted code or performs malicious actions upon creation, this could be a concern.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet; the instantiation may trigger further code execution within SDKServer.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns visible. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for compatibility, then imports and instantiates SDKServer. Since no further code is shown, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The overall structure is typical for a module setup. Without additional context or the implementation of SDKServer, no malicious intent can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing standard import and instantiation operations. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment.",
