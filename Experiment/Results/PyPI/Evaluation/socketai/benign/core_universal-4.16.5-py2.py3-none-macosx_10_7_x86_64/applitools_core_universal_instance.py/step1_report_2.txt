{
  "purpose": "This code imports a future feature and creates an instance of SDKServer, likely for providing SDK-related functionality.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with no obvious anomalies; it imports a future feature and instantiates a class, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an __future__ feature for compatibility, then imports SDKServer from a local module and creates an instance. No external input, no data processing, and no suspicious activity are present. The minimal and straightforward nature of this snippet suggests no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard boilerplate for initializing an SDK server object with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
