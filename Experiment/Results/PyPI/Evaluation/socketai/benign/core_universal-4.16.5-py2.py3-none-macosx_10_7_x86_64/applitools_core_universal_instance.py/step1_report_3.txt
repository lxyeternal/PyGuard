{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an instance of SDKServer, likely for providing SDK-related services.",
  "sources": "The code imports from __future__ and a local module .server, then creates an instance of SDKServer.",
  "sinks": "The creation of an SDKServer instance could potentially be a sink if the SDKServer class performs network operations, executes code, or handles untrusted data internally.",
  "flows": "Import statements do not involve untrusted data; the instantiation of SDKServer is a sink if its constructor or methods execute malicious code or perform network activities.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a future feature for compatibility, then imports and instantiates SDKServer. There are no evident data inputs, nor are there complex or suspicious operations. Without seeing the SDKServer implementation, it’s impossible to determine if malicious actions occur during instantiation. The code itself appears benign and standard for initializing a service component.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simple and appears to be a standard initialization pattern for an SDK server component. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. Any potential malicious activity would depend on the implementation of SDKServer, which is not provided.",
