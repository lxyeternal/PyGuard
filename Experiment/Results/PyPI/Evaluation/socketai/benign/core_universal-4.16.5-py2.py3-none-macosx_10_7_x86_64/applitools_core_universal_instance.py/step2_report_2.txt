  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is minimal: it imports `absolute_import` for compatibility and creates an instance of `SDKServer`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns within this snippet.\n   - The actual behavior of `SDKServer` is unknown; potential malicious activity could be hidden within its implementation, but based solely on this code, no issues are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - They acknowledge the limitation that the `SDKServer` implementation is unknown, which is appropriate.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`, which is reasonable given the code snippet.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2; given the lack of external data handling or suspicious patterns, these seem appropriate.\n   - **Confidence scores:** Generally high (0.8 to 0.9), reflecting the reviewers' confidence that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely import and instantiation with no external input or suspicious activity, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The risk would depend entirely on the `SDKServer` implementation, which is not provided.\n\n5. **Malware considerations:**\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior in the code snippet.\n   - The creation of an `SDKServer` instance could be a sink if the class performs malicious actions internally, but this cannot be assessed here.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the unknowns and do not infer malicious intent beyond the visible code.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable given the evidence.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is benign in isolation.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are appropriately low.\n- Any potential malicious activity would depend on the internal implementation of `SDKServer`, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (keeping it very low, as there's minimal risk in this fragment)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence that the code is benign)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code appears safe. The minimal import and instantiation pattern is standard, and no suspicious activity is evident. The overall security risk is negligible based solely on this snippet.",
