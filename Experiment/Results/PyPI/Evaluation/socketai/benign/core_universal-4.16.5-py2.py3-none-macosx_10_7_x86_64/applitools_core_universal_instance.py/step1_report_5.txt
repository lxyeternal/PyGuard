  "purpose": "This code initializes an instance of SDKServer from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code imports from __future__ and a local module '.server'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is sent externally or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to instantiation of SDKServer.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; code is straightforward, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the absolute_import feature for Python 2/3 compatibility, then imports SDKServer from a local module. It creates a singleton instance of SDKServer. There are no external data sources, user input, or network communications in this fragment. The simplicity reduces risk; no suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard initialization pattern for a local SDK server component with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
