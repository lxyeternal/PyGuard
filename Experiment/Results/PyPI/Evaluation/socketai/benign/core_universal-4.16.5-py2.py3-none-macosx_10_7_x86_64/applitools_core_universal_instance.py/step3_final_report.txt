  "purpose": "Minimal code initializing an SDK server instance; no external data or suspicious activity evident.",
  "sources": "Import of SDKServer class from local module; instantiation of SDKServer object.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of SDKServer; potential internal behavior depends on SDKServer implementation.",
  "flows": "Creation of SDKServer instance; no external data flows visible.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for compatibility, then imports and instantiates SDKServer. No user input, network activity, or data processing occurs here. The security implications depend on SDKServer's internal implementation, which is unknown. The code itself appears benign, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in reports (malware 0, risk 0.1-0.2, obfuscated 0) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation; no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The primary concern is the internal behavior of SDKServer, which cannot be assessed here. The current low risk and malware scores are appropriate given the evidence.",
