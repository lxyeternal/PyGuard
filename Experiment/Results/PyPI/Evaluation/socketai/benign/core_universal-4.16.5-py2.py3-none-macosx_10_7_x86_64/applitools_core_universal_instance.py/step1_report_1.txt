{
  "purpose": "Import absolute_import for compatibility and instantiate an SDKServer object.",
  "sources": "The code imports the SDKServer class from the local server module and creates an instance of SDKServer.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of SDKServer may invoke code that handles data or performs actions, but no specific untrusted data sink is evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is shown; the instantiation may trigger internal behaviors in SDKServer, but no direct source-to-sink flow is observable in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and creates an object. No user input, network operations, or external data handling are visible. The simplicity suggests standard initialization. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or unusual patterns. Since SDKServer's internal implementation is not provided, potential malicious behavior cannot be assessed beyond this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, performing a typical import and object instantiation with no evident malicious intent or security risks within this fragment.",
