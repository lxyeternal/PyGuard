  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code simply imports `absolute_import` from `__future__`, then imports `SDKServer` from a local module `.server`, and creates a singleton instance `instance = SDKServer()`. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no visible malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the import and instantiation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No explicit data flow; instantiation may invoke internal code.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign; internal behavior of `SDKServer` unknown.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable, given no external data or suspicious patterns. The malware score is correctly zero. Confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, minimal code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow, no external input.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Again, benign appearance.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The zero security risk and malware scores are appropriate. High confidence matches the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Instantiation could be a sink if `SDKServer` performs malicious actions internally.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign at this level; the actual risk depends on `SDKServer` implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.6.\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score of 0.2 might be slightly high if the internal `SDKServer` is untrusted, but without further info, it’s acceptable. Malware remains zero.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, standard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same as above; potential concern if SDKServer does malicious things internally.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity; typical initialization.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.1, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The very low security risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or suspicious flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard pattern; no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.1, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations & Recommendations\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's simplicity and lack of external data, these are reasonable. However, if `SDKServer`'s internal implementation is unknown or untrusted, a slightly higher risk score could be justified, but with the current info, the assigned scores are acceptable.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations\n- **Scores for malware:** Should remain at 0 unless evidence of malicious behavior is found within `SDKServer`.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher if internal `SDKServer` code is untrusted, but given the minimal code, 0.1–0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, but could be higher if internal code is untrusted)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent with the code snippet provided. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary based on the available information. The primary concern would be the trustworthiness of `SDKServer`'s internal implementation, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with a slight note that if internal implementation of `SDKServer` is untrusted, the security risk could be increased slightly, but given the data, current scores are appropriate.",
