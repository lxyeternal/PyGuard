  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided:\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\n\nfrom .server import SDKServer\n\ninstance = SDKServer()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code is minimal: it imports a future feature, imports a class from a local module, and creates an instance.\n- There are no user inputs, network calls, or data processing visible.\n- The code itself does not contain any hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The actual behavior and potential risks depend entirely on the implementation of `SDKServer`, which is not provided.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are directly observable in this snippet.** The code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Benign, standard initialization, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no issues found.  \n**Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Also benign, boilerplate code, no external data.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no suspicious activity.  \n**Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others; mentions potential concern if SDKServer performs malicious actions internally.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** The key point is that the code itself is benign, but the risk depends on SDKServer's internal implementation. Since that is unknown, the risk score remains low.  \n**Score adjustments:** The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Similar, notes that instantiation could be a sink if SDKServer performs malicious actions internally.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Correct; without SDKServer's internal code, no definitive risk can be assigned. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, standard pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no evident issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Observations & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code snippet. Since no malicious code or suspicious behavior is visible, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** The scores are generally low (0.1 to 0.2), which seems appropriate given the minimal code and lack of external data or network activity.\n\n**However, a few points:**\n- The actual security risk depends heavily on the implementation of `SDKServer`. If `SDKServer` performs malicious actions internally, the risk could be higher. But since we only have this snippet, we cannot assess that.\n- The reports correctly refrain from assigning high risk or malware scores without evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n**Based on the code snippet alone:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard initialization)\n\n**If I were to assign scores myself:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical pattern for initializing an SDK component, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only concern is that malicious behavior could occur within `SDKServer`, but that cannot be inferred from this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- All reports are consistent with the code snippet.\n- The low scores for malware and obfuscation are justified.\n- The risk score is appropriately low, assuming `SDKServer` is benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores, but emphasize that the true risk depends on the internal implementation of `SDKServer`. If future analysis reveals malicious behavior inside `SDKServer`, scores should be adjusted accordingly.",
