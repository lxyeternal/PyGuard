{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'core-universal' package and provide access to an 'instance' object.",
  "sources": "The function _version reads the package name 'core-universal' to obtain its version; get_instance imports the 'instance' module to access an 'instance' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted input are present; the code primarily reads package metadata and static module imports.",
  "flows": "The code flows from calling _version to retrieve package version, then from get_instance to import a local module and return an attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. Usage of __future__ import is standard, and package version retrieval is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the package version, first by importlib.metadata (assuming Python >= 3.9), with a fallback to pkg_resources for older Python versions. It then exposes a function to return an 'instance' object from a local module. All operations involve standard package management and module imports with no suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious code. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network connections, or unusual code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard version retrieval and local module import, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a legitimate package setup.",
