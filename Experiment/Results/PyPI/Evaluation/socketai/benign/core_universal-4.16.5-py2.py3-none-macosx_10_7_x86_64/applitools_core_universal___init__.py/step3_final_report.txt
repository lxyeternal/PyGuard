{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'core-universal' package and provide access to the 'instance' object from a local module.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version or pkg_resources.get_distribution for package version; local import of .instance module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication present",
  "flows": "Version retrieval source to return statement; local module import to return instance",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of standard libraries and local module",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python mechanisms to obtain package version information with a fallback for older Python versions, and imports a local module to expose an instance. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is simple, clear, and aligns with typical package utility functions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature; minor security risk scores in some are overstated given the code's simplicity. The overall structure shows no anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for version retrieval and local module access, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the small security risk score in one report should be adjusted to zero for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
