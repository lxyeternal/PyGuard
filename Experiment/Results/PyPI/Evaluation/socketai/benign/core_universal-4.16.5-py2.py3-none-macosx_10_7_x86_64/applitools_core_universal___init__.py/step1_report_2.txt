{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and expose the version of the 'core-universal' package and provide a function to get an instance from a local module.",
  "sources": "Reading package version via importlib.metadata or pkg_resources, importing local module 'instance'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output is evident.",
  "flows": "Fetching package version (source) and returning a local module attribute (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed. The version retrieval adapts to Python versions, which is standard. Importing a local module 'instance' is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically retrieves the package version using standard libraries, compatible with multiple Python versions, and exposes a simple accessor for an 'instance' object from a local module. No user input, network communication, or sensitive data handling is present. The code structure and logic appear standard, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version retrieval and module import pattern with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
