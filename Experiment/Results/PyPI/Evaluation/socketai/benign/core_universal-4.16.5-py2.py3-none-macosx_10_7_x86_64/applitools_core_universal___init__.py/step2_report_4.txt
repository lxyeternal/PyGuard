  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, straightforward, retrieves package version, imports a local module, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard package version retrieval and local module import; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No suspicious behavior observed.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), mentions a small security risk (0.1). The reasoning is still that the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The minor securityRisk score reflects a cautious approach, but given the code's simplicity, it might be overly conservative. No actual vulnerabilities or suspicious activity are present.\n\n**Recommendation:** Since the code is benign, the securityRisk score should remain at 0.0. The small adjustment to 0.1 isn't justified by the code content.\n\n**Justification:** The code performs standard package version retrieval and local module import, with no external network activity, no data leaks, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard version retrieval and local module access; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: benign, standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, uses standard Python practices, and shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is appropriately 0.0.\n- The securityRisk score is correctly 0.0 in all cases; minor elevations in some reports are unwarranted given the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.0.\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.0.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0.0 for all reports, as no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Confidence:** Remain high (1.0), as the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, **the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements**. The scores assigned in the reports are mostly appropriate, but the small security risk score in Report 3 should be lowered to 0.0.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's simplicity.",
