{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and expose the version of the 'core-universal' package and provide an interface to get an instance from a module.",
  "sources": "Reading package version via importlib.metadata or pkg_resources; importing the 'instance' module.",
  "sinks": "Returning 'instance.instance' could potentially expose an object, but not malicious by itself.",
  "flows": "The version retrieval flows from package name to version string; get_instance() imports and returns an attribute from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns observed. Use of fallback import methods is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally retrieves a package version using two methods depending on Python version, which is typical for compatibility. It also provides a function to get an instance from a local module. No suspicious data flows, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident. The import statements are straightforward and limited to standard practices. There is no indication of malicious data exfiltration or backdoors. The overall structure and content appear benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for version detection and module access. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
