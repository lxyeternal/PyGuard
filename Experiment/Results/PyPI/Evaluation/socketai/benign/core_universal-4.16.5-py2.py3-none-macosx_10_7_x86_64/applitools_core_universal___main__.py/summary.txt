  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but poses a security risk due to executing external code with untrusted inputs without validation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware scores at 0 and moderate risk scores (~0.5). The primary concern is the potential for exploitation if 'executable_path' or arguments are compromised. Proper validation and sanitization are recommended to mitigate this risk."
