{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for managing SEG-Y seismic data files, providing methods for reading, interpreting, and manipulating seismic traces, headers, and associated metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads from file descriptors, modules, and class attributes such as 'fd', 'metrics()', and user inputs in methods like interpret() and header setters.",
  "sinks": "Writes via flush(), close(), header modifications, attribute updates, and warnings; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file descriptors and user inputs into internal class attributes and structures; no external data leaks or network activity detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Warnings about unknown formats and experimental features are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, typical for seismic data management, with standard validation and data handling. No malicious behavior, network activity, or sabotage evident. Warnings are normal for unsupported formats. No obfuscation detected. The code operates solely on local data and file I/O.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for seismic data processing with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, primarily reflecting benign warnings and experimental features, not malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
