  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is static, defining constants with no dynamic or untrusted input.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The logic is straightforward.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, static data definitions. No concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same reasoning as above.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Also benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Static definitions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No, but note that the import of 'Enum' could be from a local module or standard library. No malicious implication.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard constants.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Anomaly:** The duplicate key `'Unassigned1'` with different values (`3261` in class, `3301` in dictionary). This appears to be an oversight or inconsistency, not malicious.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.1 — perhaps slightly elevated due to the inconsistency, but not malicious.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The inconsistency might cause bugs or confusion but doesn't pose a security threat.\n- **Conclusion:** Static definitions with a minor inconsistency, not malicious.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and intended for defining constants.\n- No malicious activity, dynamic code, or obfuscation detected.\n- The only minor point is the duplicate `'Unassigned1'` key in report 4, which is likely an oversight, not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports; no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 at most, due to the duplicate key inconsistency, but not a security risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to minor inconsistency, not security threat)\n\nThis code is a standard, static constants definition for seismic header fields with no security concerns.",
