  "purpose": "Define an enumeration and a dictionary for seismic data header fields and their corresponding codes.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes and dictionary initialization with hardcoded key-value pairs.",
  "sinks": "No direct input/output or untrusted data handling present; static data structures only.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of an Enum class and a dictionary mapping header field names to integer codes, typical for representing seismic data headers. No input handling, network operations, or data processing is present. The code structure is static, well-formatted, and standard for such use cases. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The only potential concern might be if this code is used in a malicious context elsewhere, but within this snippet, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, static data definition for seismic header fields with no malicious intent or security risks.",
