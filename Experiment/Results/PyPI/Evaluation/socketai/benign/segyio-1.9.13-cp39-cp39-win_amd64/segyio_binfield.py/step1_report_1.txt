{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration and a dictionary mapping for seismic trace header fields, likely used for seismic data processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module, static definitions of Enum class attributes, and a hardcoded dictionary mapping field names to codes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data output, network operations, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static data definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and solely defines constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module, defines an Enum class for seismic header fields with associated numeric codes, and creates a dictionary mapping field names to codes. The data appears static, with no runtime input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The structure and content are typical for configuration or constant definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static declaration of constants used for seismic data headers. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
