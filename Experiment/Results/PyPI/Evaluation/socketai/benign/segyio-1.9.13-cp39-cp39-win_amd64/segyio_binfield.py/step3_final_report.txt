  "purpose": "Static definition of seismic header field constants using an Enum class and a dictionary for easy reference.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the class attributes and dictionary keys defining header field codes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static constants only.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from external sources to sinks; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate key 'Unassigned1' with different values (3261 in class, 3301 in dictionary), likely an oversight.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a static Enum class and a dictionary mapping header field names to their numeric codes. No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or data processing is present. The duplicate 'Unassigned1' key is an inconsistency but not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code. The minor inconsistency does not pose a security threat but could cause logical issues if used improperly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static constants module for seismic header fields with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only issue is a duplicate key, which is an oversight rather than malicious. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
