  "purpose": "Provides functions to open and interpret SEG-Y seismic data files, extracting header and geometric information for seismic analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads from file headers, trace headers, and metadata via the segyio library and numpy arrays.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communication; primarily reads and processes local file data.",
  "flows": "Reads file headers and trace headers (sources) and updates internal attributes or metadata (sinks), with no external data flow or untrusted input processing beyond file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling (except:) which can mask errors but does not indicate malicious activity; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for seismic data file handling, with clear structure and typical error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation are detected. Exception handling is broad but common in I/O routines. No external communication or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation for seismic data processing with no malicious intent or security risks. The low risk score accurately reflects its routine nature, and the absence of malware or obfuscation is confirmed.",
