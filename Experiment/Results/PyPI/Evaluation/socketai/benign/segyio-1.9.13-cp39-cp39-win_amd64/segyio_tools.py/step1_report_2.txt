{
  "purpose": "The code provides various utility functions for handling SEG-Y seismic data files, including data extraction, creation, resampling, and metadata management.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external files via segyio.open() and segyio.create(); it also reads from numpy arrays and input parameters for header fields.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily manipulates data in memory and updates file headers. It does not write or transmit untrusted data externally, nor does it execute code based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file or array inputs into functions that process and reshape or modify data structures, with header information being updated accordingly; no external network or system command flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation. No code injection, malicious data leaks, or system disruptions are evident. Usage of numpy and segyio appears standard and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of functions for reading, creating, and manipulating SEG-Y files and numpy arrays, with no signs of malicious intent. It does not execute external commands, access environment variables, or perform network operations. The functions operate on provided data or file handles, with proper error handling for input validation. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors are observed. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate utility library for seismic data management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe and legitimate, intended for seismic data processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this module.",
