{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for reading, writing, and manipulating SEG-Y seismic data files, including creating files from arrays, resampling, extracting metadata, and plotting headers.",
  "sources": "Reads from segyio.SegyFile objects, numpy arrays, and file names; accesses file headers, sample data, and trace headers.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes or modifies file headers and trace data; creates new files from arrays; updates binary and trace headers during resampling.",
  "flows": "Input data (from files or arrays) is processed to generate headers, sample indices, or new data files; functions transform or write data to disk, often modifying headers or creating files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks detected. The code performs standard data processing and file I/O for seismic data. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for SEG-Y data handling, including reading, writing, and transforming seismic data arrays. It relies on the 'segyio' library and numpy. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. All functions perform expected operations such as file creation, data conversion, metadata extraction, and resampling. The code does not include any obfuscated constructs, hidden code, or suspicious logic. It strictly adheres to seismic data processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate set of utilities for seismic data processing with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It is well-structured for its purpose, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors identified.",
