{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling SEG-Y seismic data files, including reading, writing, array conversions, header creation, and metadata extraction. It facilitates seismic data processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Functions read data from files, arrays, and headers; e.g., file I/O, array inputs, and header dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network outputs; data flows are confined within file and array manipulations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays or files through processing functions, converting formats, creating headers, and writing back to files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard seismic data handling utilities, relying on 'segyio' and 'numpy'. It performs file I/O, array conversions, header creation, and metadata extraction. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external network activity are present. The internal call to 'segyio._segyio.native()' is a low-level function typical for data conversion, not malicious. The functions are designed for legitimate data processing tasks, with no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse if untrusted data is passed, but this is common for such libraries. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly identified as zero. The risk score should be low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical caution for data handling but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility library for seismic data processing. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. The minimal security risk score is appropriate, considering potential misuse but no active threats.",
