  "purpose": "This code provides a Python library for seismic data processing, including class definitions, module imports, and documentation for handling SEGY files.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.binfield, .segysampleformat, .tracesortingformat, .tracefield, .open, .create, .segy, .tools, su), which may handle data input or processing.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or untrusted data handling within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code sets up classes and imports modules that could process or handle data, but no active data flow or untrusted data paths are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution are present. The code is well-structured and documentation-rich.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward Enum class and imports several internal modules related to seismic data processing. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The documentation suggests usage for large file streaming and data manipulation, but no actual data processing occurs here. The absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs indicates this is a benign, standard library setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured open-source seismic data processing library with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.2) is a cautious estimate considering the imported modules that could handle data, but no malicious activity is evident.",
