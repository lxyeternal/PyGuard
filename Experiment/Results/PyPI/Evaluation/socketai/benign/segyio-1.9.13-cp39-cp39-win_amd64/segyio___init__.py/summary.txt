  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured open-source seismic data processing library with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.2) is a cautious estimate considering the imported modules that could handle data, but no malicious activity is evident."
