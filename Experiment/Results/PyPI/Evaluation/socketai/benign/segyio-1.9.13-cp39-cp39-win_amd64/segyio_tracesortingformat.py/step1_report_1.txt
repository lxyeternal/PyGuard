  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for trace sorting formats.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from . import Enum",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no dynamic execution or data processing",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import (. import Enum) may be suspicious if the context is unclear, but in itself not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with three members representing sorting formats. The import statement uses relative import syntax, which could be normal in package modules but might sometimes be misused. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The code is straightforward and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations. Overall, it is safe.",
