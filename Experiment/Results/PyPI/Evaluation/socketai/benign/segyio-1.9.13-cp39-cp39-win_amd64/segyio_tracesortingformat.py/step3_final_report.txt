  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for trace sorting formats within a package module.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Enum' from a relative module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, input/output, or external data sources; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import 'from . import Enum' could be considered unusual outside package context but is standard in package modules; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward enum class defining three sorting format constants. It imports 'Enum' via a relative import, which is typical in package modules. There are no dynamic executions, external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious constructs suggest benign intent. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with high confidence scores. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriately set to zero, reflecting no threats. The relative import does not constitute a security concern in this context. Overall, the code poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enumeration definition with no malicious or security issues. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary; the code can be considered safe.",
