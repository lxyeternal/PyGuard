  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different trace sorting formats.",
  "sources": "Imports from the current package/module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import; no suspicious or unusual code constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum class with three members, imported from the same package. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no data manipulation. The import statement is standard for modular code. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign enumeration definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
