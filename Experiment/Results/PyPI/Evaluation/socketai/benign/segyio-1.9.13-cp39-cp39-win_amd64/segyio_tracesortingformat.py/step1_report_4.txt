  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class for trace sorting formats",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Enum from the current package/module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow from untrusted sources observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum from a relative module and defines a class with three named constants representing sorting formats. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward enumeration definition, with no external inputs, data processing, or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple enumeration definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as a part of a larger codebase to standardize sorting format identifiers.",
