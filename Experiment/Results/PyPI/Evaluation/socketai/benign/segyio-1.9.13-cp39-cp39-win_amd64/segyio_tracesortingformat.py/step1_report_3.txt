  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class for different trace sorting formats.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the same package/module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; code is simply defining an enum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward enum definition with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an Enum class from the local package/module and defines a subclass 'TraceSortingFormat' with three members representing sorting types. There are no input/output operations, network connections, or any suspicious constructs. The code appears to be a standard enumeration definition without obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign enum definition for sorting formats. No malicious activity or security issues are evident.",
