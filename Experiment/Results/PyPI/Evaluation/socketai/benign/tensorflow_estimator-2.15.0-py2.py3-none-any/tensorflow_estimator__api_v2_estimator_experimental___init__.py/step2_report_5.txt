  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements from the tensorflow_estimator library.\n- The comments explicitly state that the file is machine-generated, which is typical for API stubs.\n- There are no data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code does not contain any secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- All imported modules and functions are from a trusted, well-known library.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard auto-generated API stub with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues found.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; benign auto-generated API module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Again, an auto-generated API import file with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern; benign, auto-generated API setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Consistent with others; standard API import file.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward, auto-generated import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is static, trusted, and only imports known modules, a low risk score (close to 0) is appropriate.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**  \nGiven the content, I agree with the assigned scores. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign, auto-generated API stub with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
