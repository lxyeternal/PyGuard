  "purpose": "Static import statements for TensorFlow estimator API components, auto-generated for exposing functions and classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from tensorflow_estimator.python.estimator submodules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports do not process external input or output",
  "flows": "None; the code only imports modules without data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward auto-generated API stub with comments indicating machine generation",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from a trusted library, with comments indicating auto-generation. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code's purpose is to expose API components; it does not perform any operations or contain executable logic. The absence of any malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior suggests a benign, standard API stub.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated API module with no malicious intent or security risks. It only imports trusted components from the TensorFlow estimator library. The scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code.",
