{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing and possibly communicates with external services.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, configuration files, or network requests within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent over network connections, written to files, or used in system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (such as environment variables or network) through processing functions, potentially reaching output sinks like network sockets or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or obfuscated code observed. Usage of dynamic features appears standard; no unusual constructs or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows typical structure, importing common libraries and executing functions that process data. No signs of code injection, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors are evident. Security-related checks like input validation or encryption are present but seem standard. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or unauthorized access appears detectable. The code’s behavior aligns with legitimate data processing routines.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears to be benign, with no suspicious anomalies or malware indications. The security risk score is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
