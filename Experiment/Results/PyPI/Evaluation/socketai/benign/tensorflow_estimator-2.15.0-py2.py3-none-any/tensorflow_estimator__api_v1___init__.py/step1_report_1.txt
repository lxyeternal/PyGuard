  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing and network communication tasks, likely related to monitoring or data collection.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, user input functions, or data files (if any).",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections, possibly data storage or logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Data from input sources flows into processing functions and then potentially transmitted over network sockets or stored.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data found. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No clear backdoors or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard libraries and functions for data handling and network communication. No signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or data exfiltration. The structure indicates typical application logic without suspicious behavior. Absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious URL domains. No obfuscation detected. Code appears straightforward with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate application code with no indicators of supply chain compromise or malware.",
