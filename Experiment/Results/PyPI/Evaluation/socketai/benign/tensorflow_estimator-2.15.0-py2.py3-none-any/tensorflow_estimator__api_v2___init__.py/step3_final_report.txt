{
  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, environment variables, and general data inputs; no specific untrusted data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or security effects could occur at data handling points, but no suspicious sinks such as network connections, file modifications, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through code logic; no malicious or anomalous flows detected, as code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs identified; code is simple and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets and descriptions indicate benign utility scripts or package components with standard input/output and environment interactions. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities was found. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign analysis. Confidence levels are high due to the lack of suspicious activity and straightforward code. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present, and the overall security posture appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected. The low security risk scores are justified, and the assessments are consistent with the provided descriptions. No modifications or higher risk scores are necessary.",
