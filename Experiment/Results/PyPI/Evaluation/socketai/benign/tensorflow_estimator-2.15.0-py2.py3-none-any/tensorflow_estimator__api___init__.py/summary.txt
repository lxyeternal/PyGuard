  "conclusion": "The reports correctly reflect the presence or absence of malicious or suspicious code. Reports without code are appropriately scored at zero. Report 5's detailed indicators justify high suspicion, warranting cautious review. Slight score increases could be considered for more conservative risk assessment, but current evaluations are appropriate and consistent."
