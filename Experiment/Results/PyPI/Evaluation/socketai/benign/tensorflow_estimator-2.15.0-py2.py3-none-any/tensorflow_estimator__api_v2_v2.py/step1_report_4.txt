{
  "purpose": "Provides public API for tf_estimator._api.v2 namespace, mainly importing modules.",
  "sources": "Import statement: import sys as _sys, and from tensorflow_estimator._api.v2 import estimator.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported modules, but no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating the file is machine generated; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and only includes import statements with a comment about being machine generated. No data input, no code execution, no suspicious functions or behaviors are present. The presence of a comment about machine generation suggests it's part of an automated API or library setup, not malicious code. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module setup with no malicious behavior. It mainly imports a module and includes a comment about being machine generated, which does not imply malicious intent.",
