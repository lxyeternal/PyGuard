  "purpose": "Provides public API access for the tensorflow_estimator._api.v2 namespace",
  "sources": "Import statement: import sys as _sys; import from tensorflow_estimator._api.v2",
  "sinks": "Import statements and potential API exposure through module imports",
  "flows": "Imported module tensorflow_estimator._api.v2 used as part of the API namespace",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating the file is machine generated; no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of comments, a simple import statement for sys, and an import of a specific module. The comment warns that the file is machine generated, which is typical in auto-generated API files. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are present. No code execution or network activity is observed. The import statements do not perform any risky operations or execute untrusted code. Overall, the code is standard for a generated API module with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated API module with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply imports a module and contains a warning comment, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
