  "purpose": "API module for tensorflow_estimator._api.v2 namespace, auto-generated for public use.",
  "sources": "Imports sys as _sys and estimator from tensorflow_estimator._api.v2.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of sys; minimal, auto-generated code with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, auto-generated Python module containing only import statements and comments. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The import of sys is unused but harmless. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and trusted source indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated API stub with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
