  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as auto-generated, primarily importing modules and wrapping the current module with `TFModuleWrapper`.\n- No untrusted data, external network activity, or data sinks are present.\n- The module wrapping pattern is standard in generated code for API exposure and deprecation management.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The reports assign very low malware and obfuscation scores, consistent with their analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** matches the descriptions: it imports modules, checks if the current module is wrapped, and conditionally wraps it with `TFModuleWrapper`.\n- No suspicious code or data flows are present.\n- The code is indeed machine-generated, as indicated by comments.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in the report summaries.\n- The reasoning about the code's benign nature is sound and well-justified.\n- The conclusion that the code is standard API scaffolding without malicious intent is accurate.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, which seems reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The only minor concern could be the dynamic module wrapping, which could potentially be misused if manipulated, but in this context, it’s standard practice.\n- Since no external data or malicious behavior is detected, the low risk scores are justified.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- No adjustments needed; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, justified by the code's benign, auto-generated nature and standard practices)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical auto-generated API module for TensorFlow, involving module imports and wrapping for API management. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign, standard generated module with minimal security concern.",
