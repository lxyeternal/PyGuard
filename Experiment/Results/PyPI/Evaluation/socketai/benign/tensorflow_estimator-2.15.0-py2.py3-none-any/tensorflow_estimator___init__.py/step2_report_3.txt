  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code performs standard module wrapping, importing sys and other modules, then replacing sys.modules[__name__] with a wrapped version. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risk is 0.1, which seems slightly high but acceptable given the module wrapping nature. No changes needed.\n- **Justification for risk/malware scores:** The code is benign, standard API boilerplate, no malicious intent.\n- **Overall:** Correctly scored.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern—import, check, wrap, assign. No malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard auto-generated code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, auto-generated API setup.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, module wrapping for API management.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, typical API wrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, boilerplate code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly indicate 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk in module wrapping, which is standard practice.\n\n### Final recommendation:\nGiven the uniformity and standard nature of this code, I would assign **overall scores** as follows:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal but standard API management practices)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, auto-generated API wrapper used in large frameworks like TensorFlow. It employs standard techniques for module wrapping and deprecation management without any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated, with a very low risk score (around 0.1) reflecting normal API management practices.",
