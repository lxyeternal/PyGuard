  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is a standard API module wrapper, importing sys, a specific estimator module, and a module_wrapper utility. It conditionally wraps itself with TFModuleWrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or suspicious behavior. The wrapping pattern is common in generated API code.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature. Security risk is low (0.1), reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Justification for risk scores:** Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are identified, the low scores are appropriate.\n- **Overall:** The report is accurate; the code is standard, with no security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Same pattern—standard auto-generated API wrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious logic or behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk is 0, consistent with benign code.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment; the code is safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Similar to previous reports, a generated API wrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, security risk is low.\n- **Justification:** The dynamic wrapping is typical for API management, not malicious.\n- **Overall:** Valid assessment; no security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Again, a generated module wrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk is minimal.\n- **Justification:** The wrapping is standard practice.\n- **Overall:** Accurate; no security issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Presence of issues:** Same pattern—standard API module setup.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, security risk is negligible.\n- **Justification:** The code's purpose is API exposure management, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and generated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent, a risk score of around 0.1 to 0.2 seems appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to module wrapping, but standard practice)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, generated API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
