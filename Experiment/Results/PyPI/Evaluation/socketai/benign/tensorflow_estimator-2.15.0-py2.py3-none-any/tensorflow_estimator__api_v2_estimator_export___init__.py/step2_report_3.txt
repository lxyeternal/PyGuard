  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a set of static import statements generated automatically, with no dynamic execution or data handling.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, execute external commands, or contain any code that could be exploited.\n   - No anomalies, such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns, are identified.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as a benign, auto-generated API stub.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely static imports from a trusted library with explicit comments indicating auto-generation.\n   - No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or risky behaviors are present.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - Since the code does not perform any malicious actions, the malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - No hidden backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and based on observable facts: static imports, auto-generated comment, absence of dynamic code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, auto-generated API stub for TensorFlow estimator export functionalities. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are accurate and should remain at zero.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0               |\n\nThis analysis confirms the code is safe and benign.",
