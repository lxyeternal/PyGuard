{
  "purpose": "Locate the 'patchelf' executable or script via system PATH and package metadata, then verify its version by executing it.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PATH' for executable search; importlib_metadata.files() for package file discovery.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call() executes the located script, potentially running untrusted code if package is compromised.",
  "flows": "The get_script() function retrieves the script path, which is then executed in test_patchelf_script().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The execution of package files without additional validation could be a concern in untrusted environments.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly locates 'patchelf' via environment PATH and package metadata, then runs it to check version. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The subprocess call relies on the trustworthiness of the package files. All indicators point to benign behavior, with minimal security risk primarily related to executing external scripts without extra validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for locating and verifying 'patchelf'. No signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise are evident. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is appropriately zero.",
