  "purpose": "Locate the 'patchelf' script in the environment and verify its version.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('PATH') to read environment variable; files('patchelf') to locate the package files",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call([script, '--version']) to execute the located script",
  "flows": "Environment PATH → which() function → subprocess call to 'patchelf' script",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or malicious backdoors detected; straightforward use of subprocess and filesystem access",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to locate the 'patchelf' executable by searching installed package files via importlib_metadata, then verifies its version using subprocess. It relies on environment variables and package metadata, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The subprocess call executes a verified script, and no obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform legitimate package management and verification tasks without malicious intent or security risks. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident.",
