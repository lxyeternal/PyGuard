{
  "purpose": "Automates build, lint, and test workflows for a Python project using nox sessions.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from session arguments and filesystem (e.g., glob, Path), and environment variables via nox.Session methods.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations (rename, mkdir), subprocess calls (session.run), package installation (session.install).",
  "flows": "Filesystem reads for globbing; session.run executes commands; build process outputs files to 'dist'; test dependencies installed from local files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines nox sessions for building, linting, and testing a Python project. The build function compiles source distributions and wheels, saving them locally. The lint function runs pre-commit hooks, and the tests function installs test dependencies and runs pytest. All operations are standard development workflows, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized data access. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. The overall structure and behavior align with common CI/CD practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs routine build, lint, and test operations without evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical development automation script with no suspicious behavior detected.",
