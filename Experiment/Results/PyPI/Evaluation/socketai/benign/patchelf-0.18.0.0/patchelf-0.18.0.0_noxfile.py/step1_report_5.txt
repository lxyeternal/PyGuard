{
  "purpose": "The code defines automation sessions for building, linting, and testing a Python project using nox.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the filesystem (glob for wheel and tar.gz files, creating directories), and installs dependencies via session.install().",
  "sinks": "The code executes external commands via session.run(), potentially executing untrusted input if session.posargs are malicious, but no explicit untrusted data sources are evident. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "The build function creates distribution files and returns the filename; the tests function installs the built wheel and runs pytest with positional arguments; lint runs pre-commit. The main flow involves building, then testing or linting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code is evident. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution, or unusual variable manipulations. Use of global variable 'built' is benign in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical nox configuration script for automating Python project tasks. It creates distribution files, runs linters, and executes tests. All commands involve standard tooling (build, pre-commit, pytest). No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden payloads are present. The code does not process untrusted input in a dangerous manner; it relies on session.posargs for test arguments, which is typical for such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard automation script for project maintenance with no detectable malicious behavior or security risks. It performs common build and test tasks securely. No malicious intent or security violations are evident.",
