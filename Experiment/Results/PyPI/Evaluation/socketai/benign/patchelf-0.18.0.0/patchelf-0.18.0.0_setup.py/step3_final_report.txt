  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'patchelf' Python package, managing build configuration, wheel tagging, and script installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'CIBUILDWHEEL'), script files ('bin/patchelf'), README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "File copying and permission modification (os.chmod), environment variable influence on build tags.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence wheel tags; scripts are copied to build directory; permissions are modified on POSIX systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Permission modifications are standard for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical build and packaging tasks for a Python project, including customizing wheel tags based on environment variables and copying scripts with executable permissions. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The environment variable 'CIBUILDWHEEL' is used to adjust build tags in CI/CD pipelines, which is standard practice. Permission changes via os.chmod are also common in build scripts to ensure executability. Overall, the script is straightforward, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of environment variables and permission modifications are typical for build processes and do not pose security risks.",
