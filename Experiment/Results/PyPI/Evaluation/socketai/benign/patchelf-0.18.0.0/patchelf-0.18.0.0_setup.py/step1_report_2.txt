{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'patchelf', including custom build commands and wheel distribution logic.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables (e.g., 'CIBUILDWHEEL'), reads README.rst file, and package scripts located at 'bin/patchelf'.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables for build customization, file system operations for copying and setting permissions, and package metadata outputs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence build tags; scripts are copied from source to build directory; file permissions are modified based on OS; package metadata is set for distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code mostly handles build configuration and file operations without executing untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom build commands for wheel distribution and script copying, with logic based on environment variables and OS. It reads a README file for long description. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious data flows are present. Use of environment variables like 'CIBUILDWHEEL' is standard for build processes. File permission adjustments are typical for POSIX systems. No data leaks, malicious network activity, or harmful code segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with custom build command extensions, intended for packaging the 'patchelf' utility. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident. It appears safe and typical for package distribution, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
