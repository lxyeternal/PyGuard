  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the accuracy of their conclusions and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a build configuration for 'patchelf', with sources including environment variables, scripts, and README.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurately notes that environment variables influence wheel tags, and scripts are copied and permission-modified.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious activity detected; standard build script behavior.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states no malicious activity, with high confidence (1).\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, well-reasoned, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script as a setup configuration, with standard sources.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes environment variables, script copying, permission changes, all typical.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation; standard build process.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states no malicious intent, with high confidence (0.95).\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 — acceptable, considering minimal security risk due to environment variable use.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies as a setup script for 'patchelf', with standard sources.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes environment variables influence build, scripts are copied, permissions set.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation; standard behavior.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states no malicious activity, with full confidence (1).\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the script's role in build and packaging, with standard sources.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes environment variables influence build tags, scripts are copied, permissions modified.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, code is typical for build scripts.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion, high confidence (1).\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the script's role; sources are standard.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes environment variables and file operations; no untrusted data processing.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states minimal security risk, high confidence (0.9).\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to environment variable usage, but nothing indicating actual vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily due to environment variable influence, but no actual security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the scores reflect this appropriately.",
