  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code and reasoning.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a setup script for a Python package ('patchelf') with custom build commands and wheel tagging logic.\n- It interacts with environment variables like 'CIBUILDWHEEL' to modify build behavior.\n- It copies scripts and adjusts permissions in a standard way.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.\n- The code appears to perform typical packaging tasks.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is for build configuration, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states that this is a standard setup script, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — perhaps slightly conservative, but acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with the code; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, confirms no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms standard build process, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also concludes no malicious activity, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 — slightly higher, but still reasonable given the context.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and Final Judgment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** Clearly, the code is straightforward; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, given the nature of the code and the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly related to build environment variability, not security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No malicious or security issues are present. The scores assigned are appropriate, perhaps slightly conservative but justified given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
