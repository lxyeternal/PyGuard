{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to facilitate building, packaging, and distributing a Python project named 'patchelf', including custom build commands and wheel distribution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., CIBUILDWHEEL), script files specified in 'scripts' parameter, and the contents of 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include modifying file permissions with os.chmod, copying scripts, and constructing distribution metadata. No untrusted data directly impacts sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'CIBUILDWHEEL' influences platform tags; script files are copied from source to build directory; distribution data is assembled for setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of environment variables appears standard for build customization. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements custom build commands and setup procedures typical for Python packaging. It utilizes environment variables for build customization but does not process untrusted user input or perform any network operations. The functions for copying scripts and setting permissions are standard for build scripts. No anomalies such as hidden code, suspicious file operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical setup script for a Python package with custom build commands. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code performs standard packaging tasks without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
