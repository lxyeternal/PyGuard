{
  "purpose": "This script defines setup and build commands for packaging and distributing a Python utility called 'patchelf', including custom build steps for wheel files and scripts.",
  "sources": "OS environment variables (CIBUILDWHEEL), script files specified in 'scripts' parameter, external modules such as setuptools, skbuild, wheel, and get_version() from setuptools_scm.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used to influence build behavior, file system operations (os.chmod, os.stat, os.path), script files copied and potentially modified, and version info fetched from external sources.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'CIBUILDWHEEL' influences the 'get_tag' method, affecting build tags; script files are copied and their permissions modified; version info is retrieved via get_version(); scripts are specified and copied to build directory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code found. The code performs standard build and packaging tasks. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, including custom build commands and wheel tag modifications based on environment variables. It reads environment variables, copies scripts, and adjusts file permissions in a standard way. The use of environment variables like 'CIBUILDWHEEL' is common in CI/CD pipelines, and no data leakage, malicious network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, serving to facilitate building and packaging a Python utility. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indications. All operations are related to setup and build processes with no signs of security risks.",
