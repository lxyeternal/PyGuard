  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, logic, and scores, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the script manages build configuration, environment variables, and scripts.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious or harmful file operations; environment variables are used as intended.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors. The logic is standard for build scripts.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; the script is safe, and the report's confidence is high.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, correctly identifies build setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data handling; environment variables influence build behavior normally.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of environment variables like 'CIBUILDWHEEL' is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified; the script appears safe.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable, given the minimal risk associated with build scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, correctly notes standard setup procedures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious activity; file operations are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; the script is typical and safe.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes build configuration and environment variable influence.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows; operations are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified; safe and standard.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the setup script's nature.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data handling; environment variables are used for build logic.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; the code is standard for packaging.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable, considering the minimal inherent risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on zero, which is consistent. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) in some reports, reflecting the inherent risk in build scripts that modify permissions and rely on environment variables, but nothing suspicious.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, typical for build scripts; no security vulnerabilities or backdoors.\n\n**Note:** The only potential concern is the modification of script permissions with `os.chmod`, but this is standard for build scripts to ensure executability and does not pose a security risk in this context.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The environment variable usage and file operations are typical and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, reflecting the script's benign nature.",
