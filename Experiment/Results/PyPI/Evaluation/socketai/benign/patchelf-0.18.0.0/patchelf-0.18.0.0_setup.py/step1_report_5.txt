{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom build commands and setup configuration for a Python package called 'patchelf', primarily for building and distributing ELF binary modification utilities.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), reading files (README.rst), calling external setup functions (get_version), and using command-line arguments (scripts).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code involves file operations and environment variable checks but no untrusted data processing or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence conditional logic (e.g., 'CIBUILDWHEEL'), but there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could lead to data leaks or injections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard setup and build script code, with no obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily contains setup configuration for packaging a Python project, including custom build commands for wheel distributions and script copying. It interacts with environment variables to determine build tags but does not process untrusted input data in a manner that could lead to security issues. There are no indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or system disruption functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with custom build commands. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, and the likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
