  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Twitter API client with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or supply chain attack. It follows best practices for credential management and API interaction. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the potential for misuse but not by any inherent vulnerabilities or malicious code."
