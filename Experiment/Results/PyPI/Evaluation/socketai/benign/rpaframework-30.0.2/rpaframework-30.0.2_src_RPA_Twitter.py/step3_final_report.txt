  "purpose": "A Python wrapper library for Twitter API interactions, including authentication, fetching tweets, posting, liking, following, and unfollowing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables or function parameters for credentials; API calls for user data, tweets, and actions.",
  "sinks": "API responses and data structures; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Credential setup flows into API authentication; API responses flow into data processing and return values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious API misuse.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured wrapper around Tweepy, managing credentials securely via environment variables or parameters. It performs typical Twitter API operations with proper error handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The use of environment variables and explicit API calls aligns with best practices. Error handling and data retrieval are straightforward. The code's purpose is legitimate, and its functions are transparent and predictable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Twitter API client with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or supply chain attack. It follows best practices for credential management and API interaction. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the potential for misuse but not by any inherent vulnerabilities or malicious code.",
