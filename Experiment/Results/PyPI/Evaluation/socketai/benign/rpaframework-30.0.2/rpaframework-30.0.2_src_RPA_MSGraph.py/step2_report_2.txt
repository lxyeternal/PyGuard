  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and if the scores reflect the actual risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a wrapper for Microsoft Graph API, handling OAuth, file management, SharePoint, etc. Inputs are tokens, URLs, IDs, etc.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, JSON parsing, file writes—standard for such apps.\n- **Flows:** Data flows from user inputs to API calls and file system operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. URL encoding is standard practice.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a well-structured API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, with a high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The logic and reasoning are sound. The scores are appropriate; malware is correctly 0, and risk is low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar wrapper, focusing on API interactions, URL encoding, and data handling.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, data processing, URL encoding—standard, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Flows:** Inputs flow into API calls, URL encoding, and file operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. URL encoding is standard.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; the code is a legitimate API wrapper.\n- **Conclusion:** High confidence (0.9), malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with focus on OAuth, file management, SharePoint.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, token handling, file downloads—standard.\n- **Flows:** Inputs to API calls, token refresh, file operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected; the code is a standard API wrapper.\n- **Conclusion:** High confidence, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose, API wrapper for Microsoft Graph.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, file downloads, API responses—expected.\n- **Flows:** Inputs to API interactions, token management, file handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard, legitimate code.\n- **Conclusion:** High confidence, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, for automating Microsoft Graph operations.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, file operations, API responses.\n- **Flows:** Inputs into API calls, URL encoding, token handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; code appears legitimate.\n- **Conclusion:** High confidence, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which is accurate; no obfuscated or confusing code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above 0.2 (0.2), which seems appropriate given the network and file operations, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports. No signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 seems reasonable, reflecting standard network/file operations without active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are thorough, and their assessments are justified. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate, secure API wrapper for Microsoft Graph, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
