{
  "purpose": "The code is a wrapper around the O365 library for Microsoft Graph API, enabling file management, SharePoint operations, OAuth authentication, and user data retrieval for robotic automation tasks.",
  "sources": "User inputs (e.g., URLs, IDs, tokens), API responses, token storage, and network requests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Microsoft Graph endpoints, JSON parsing, file system read/write operations, URL encoding for share links.",
  "flows": "Inputs (user parameters, tokens) lead to API calls and URL encoding; responses are processed for file operations or data retrieval; tokens are refreshed or stored as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, URL encoding is standard, no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API wrapper that manages OAuth tokens, interacts with OneDrive and SharePoint, and handles file uploads/downloads. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present. Network and file operations are typical for such integrations. URL encoding of share links follows standard practices. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure API wrapper for Microsoft Graph, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting standard network and file operations without vulnerabilities. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0.",
