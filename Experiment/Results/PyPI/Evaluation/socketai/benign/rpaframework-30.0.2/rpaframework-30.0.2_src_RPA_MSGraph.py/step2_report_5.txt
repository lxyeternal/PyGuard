  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a wrapper around O365 for Microsoft Graph, handling OAuth, files, SharePoint, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes network requests, JSON parsing, and file system operations—standard for such functionality.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code observed. URL encoding of share links is standard practice.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes low malware risk, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues found. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the library's role in Microsoft Graph interaction.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes data flows involving URL encoding, API requests, and file downloads, all standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. URL encoding aligns with Microsoft Graph practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is reasonable. No malicious activity evident. Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, correctly describing the library's role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Focuses on network requests, token management, and file operations—standard for such wrappers.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. URL encoding is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified low risk and malware scores.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and accurate. Malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a Microsoft Graph API wrapper.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes network requests, token handling, and file operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated code detected. URL encoding is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate low security risk and malware scores.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code's purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes network requests, API responses, file downloads—typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. URL encoding is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justifies minimal security risk and malware likelihood.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code detected.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor concern could be URL encoding, but it is standard practice for share links, not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, typical for API wrappers with network interactions)\n\n**Note:** The code is a well-structured API wrapper with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The network and data flows are standard, and the handling of tokens and URLs aligns with best practices.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**The overall security assessment indicates no malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores should remain at:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low but acknowledging network interactions)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses provided and the code's intended functionality.",
