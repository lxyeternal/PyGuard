  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, data flows, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's MFA and OAuth2 functions. Data flows are standard, secrets from Vault, parameters, and network interactions via established libraries.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses well-known libraries (`pyotp`, `requests_oauthlib`), handles exceptions properly.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate MFA/OAuth2 implementation with no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly identifies the MFA and OAuth2 functionalities. Mentions secrets from Vault, network calls for token exchange, and standard flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. External libraries are standard. No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard implementation. Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) perhaps due to the inherent risks in handling OAuth tokens.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly describes the code's MFA and OAuth2 support. No hardcoded secrets, network activity is standard for OAuth.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses standard libraries and flows.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate code, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Accurately describes the MFA and OAuth2 workflows. No hardcoded secrets, network activity is typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses established libraries.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly captures the MFA and OAuth2 functions, with secure handling of secrets.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, secure implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting inherent risks in handling OAuth tokens and secrets, but nothing malicious or insecure.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — appropriate given the handling of secrets and OAuth tokens, but no major security flaw.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (average of the reports' scores, reflecting minor inherent risks but no malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate MFA and OAuth2 utility, securely implemented with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
