{
  "purpose": "This code provides a library for generating and managing MFA OTPs and OAuth2 tokens, primarily for authentication workflows in automation tasks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include secrets retrieved from the Robocorp Vault, input parameters for OTP modes and OAuth URLs, and data from OAuth2 responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the OAuth token exchange process and OTP generation, which handle sensitive credentials and tokens; secrets from Vault and OAuth tokens are stored/used internally.",
  "flows": "Secrets from Vault feed into OTP setup; OTP generation functions use these secrets; OAuth URLs are generated, and tokens are exchanged and refreshed using OAuth endpoints; sensitive data flows from Vault and parameters to token functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors detected. Usage of external libraries appears standard. No unusual or obfuscated code segments. No network connections or data exfiltration observed within this module.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interfaces with external libraries (pyotp, requests_oauthlib, RPA vault) for OTP and OAuth workflows. It includes exception handling for uninitialized sessions and uses Vault for secret management, which is standard. No evidence of malicious code such as data leaks, hidden network activity, or sabotage mechanisms is present. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns detected. The module appears to securely manage secrets and handle OAuth2 flows as intended.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of MFA and OAuth2 token management with no signs of malicious intent or security compromise. It uses established libraries and proper exception handling. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain risks are evident.",
