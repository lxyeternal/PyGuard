{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) library supporting OTP (Time-based and Counter-based) and OAuth2 session management, primarily for generating and handling MFA codes and OAuth authorization flows.",
  "sources": "Reads MFA secrets from the Robocorp Vault, user-provided OTP passcodes, OAuth authorization URLs, and response URLs containing authorization codes.",
  "sinks": "Uses secrets from Vault, generates OTPs, and exchanges OAuth tokens via network requests; no untrusted data is directly written or leaked.",
  "flows": "Secrets are retrieved from Vault to set OTPs; OTPs are generated on demand; OAuth URLs are generated and tokens fetched/exchanged through OAuth2Session, with network communication for OAuth flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Uses standard libraries (`pyotp`, `requests_oauthlib`) and proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of MFA and OAuth2 workflows, utilizing well-known libraries and secure practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The OAuth token handling involves network requests but follows standard procedures. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data flows are present. The exception handling and secret management are appropriate. The overall structure and logic are clear and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure MFA and OAuth2 utility with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflecting the inherent network interactions involved in OAuth flows.",
