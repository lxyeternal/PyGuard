  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's functionality—OTP generation via pyotp, OAuth2 via requests_oauthlib, secrets from Vault, and standard OAuth flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is thorough and aligns with the code's implementation. The malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly identifies the code as MFA/OAuth2 management, with secrets from Vault and network interactions for OAuth.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code. Uses external libraries properly.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states no malicious intent; security risk is low (0.2), which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to previous reports, correctly describes the flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a legitimate MFA/OAuth2 utility; the malware score remains 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately captures the code's MFA and OAuth2 functionality.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior detected; malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly summarizes the code's purpose and data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No issues; malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are at or near 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature as a standard MFA and OAuth2 utility.\n- **Malware Scores:** Correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (around 0.1-0.2), consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to network operations and secret handling, but nothing malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a legitimate MFA/OAuth2 implementation with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are justified and align with the code's behavior.",
