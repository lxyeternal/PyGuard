{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) library for Robot Framework, providing OTP and OAuth2 functionality for secure authentication workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads secrets from the Robocorp Vault (`Vault().get_secret()`), user-provided parameters (e.g., OTP passcodes, OAuth URLs, tokens), and environment/context for OAuth sessions.",
  "sinks": "Uses secrets for OTP generation, and performs OAuth token exchanges and refreshes via `requests_oauthlib`. No data leaks or insecure use observed.",
  "flows": "Secrets from Vault or parameters flow into OTP setup or OAuth flows; OAuth URLs generate requests for authorization and token exchange; OAuth tokens are stored/used in session object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. All functions and data flows align with expected MFA functionalities. No obfuscation or concealed code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and well-known packages (`pyotp`, `requests_oauthlib`, `robot.api.deco`). It handles MFA secrets securely by reading from Vault and does not log or expose sensitive data. OAuth flow procedures follow standard OAuth2 practices. Exception handling is present for uninitialized MFA or OAuth objects. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors. The code's structure and logic are clear and consistent with typical MFA implementations. No obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate MFA utility for Robot Framework, handling OTP generation and OAuth2 authorization securely and properly. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
