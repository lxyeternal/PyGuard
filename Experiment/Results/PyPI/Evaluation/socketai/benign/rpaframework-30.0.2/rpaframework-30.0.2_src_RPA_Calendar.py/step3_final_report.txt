{
  "purpose": "The code provides date and time utilities, including holiday calculations, business day determination, date formatting, and timezone differences, primarily for automation testing with Robot Framework.",
  "sources": "Date parsing and formatting functions, holiday lookup, timezone calculations, and date comparisons.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; no network or system modifications; data flows are internal and standard.",
  "flows": "Input data (dates, formats, timezones) are parsed, processed via standard libraries, and results are formatted or returned; no external data sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no network activity, no backdoors or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code uses reputable open-source libraries (pendulum, holidays) for date/time and holiday management. It performs standard operations such as parsing, formatting, date comparisons, and holiday calculations. Exception handling is appropriate, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The functions are straightforward, with clear logic and no external data exfiltration or network calls. The overall structure and flow are typical for utility libraries, with no anomalies indicating sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured date/time utility library with no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. It relies on standard, reputable libraries and performs common date operations. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero, indicating no malicious intent.",
