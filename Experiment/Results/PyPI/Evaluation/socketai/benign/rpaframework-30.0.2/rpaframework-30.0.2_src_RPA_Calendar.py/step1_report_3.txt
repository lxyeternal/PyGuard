{
  "purpose": "Library for handling date and time operations, including business days, holidays, and timezone calculations, primarily for use with Robot Framework.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters such as date strings, lists, and environment variables; data is parsed or manipulated via pendulum and holidays libraries.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks exist that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or harmful actions; no network connections, file writes, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve parsing input dates, comparing dates, calculating differences, and returning formatted results; no untrusted data is used for executing commands or writing files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code segments are present. Usage of external libraries appears standard and well-contained. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, and no misleading variables are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extensively uses standard date parsing, holiday calculations, and date manipulations with well-known open-source libraries (pendulum and holidays). No network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration methods are observed. The functions are straightforward, focusing solely on date calculations, formatting, and holiday checking, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign and well-structured date handling library with no malicious behavior. It does not include any network connections, system modifications, or hidden backdoors. All dependencies are standard open-source packages used in date and holiday management.",
