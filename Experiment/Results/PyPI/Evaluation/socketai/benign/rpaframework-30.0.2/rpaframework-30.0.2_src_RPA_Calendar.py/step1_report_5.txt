{
  "purpose": "Library for handling date and time operations, especially in business days and holiday contexts, using pendulum and holidays packages.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (datetime, pendulum, holidays, logging, typing); class methods reading input parameters such as date strings, list of days, and country codes.",
  "sinks": "Methods converting or parsing date strings; returning date objects or formatted strings; holiday and business day calculations; no apparent sinks for untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input data (dates, country codes, holiday lists) flow through parsing, comparison, and calculation functions; no flow of untrusted data into system commands or external processes; no network, file, or sensitive data access points observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network or system calls; no obfuscated code, code injection, or dynamic execution; the code relies on external libraries for date/time handling but does not appear to invoke dangerous patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive date/time utility class using pendulum and holidays, with functions for calculating business days, holidays, date differences, and comparisons. It performs data parsing, date arithmetic, and holiday checks, all of which are standard operations with no signs of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The libraries used are open-source and reputable for date handling. There are no external network communications, system modifications, or dangerous code patterns. The code appears to be purely for date/time calculations, with well-defined inputs and outputs, and no suspicious flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate date/time utility library without any indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It leverages open-source libraries responsibly and contains no evident security risks or malware indicators.",
