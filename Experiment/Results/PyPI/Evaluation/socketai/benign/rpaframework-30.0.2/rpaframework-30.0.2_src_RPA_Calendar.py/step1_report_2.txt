{
  "purpose": "Library for handling date and time operations, including business days, holidays, and time differences, using pendulum and holidays packages.",
  "sources": "Input data from string parameters, function arguments, and date parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified—no untrusted data is directly written to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into parsing functions, with data being processed within the library's methods; no external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of third-party libraries (pendulum, holidays) is standard for date handling. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive date and holiday management library, leveraging well-known libraries (pendulum and holidays) for date parsing, formatting, and holiday calculations. It includes functions for date difference calculations, business day calculations, holiday checking, and timezone differences. The functions appear to be standard and do not perform any malicious operations such as network access, data theft, or system modification. No hardcoded secrets or malicious obfuscation are present. The code is well-structured and focused solely on date operations, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured date utility library without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely provides date and holiday management features using standard libraries and techniques.",
