{
  "purpose": "The code provides a library for handling date and time operations, especially in business days and holidays contexts, using pendulum and holidays packages. It offers functions to calculate differences, identify business days/holidays, and manage custom holidays.",
  "sources": "Reading input data includes parameters such as date strings, date objects, country codes, timezone strings, and list inputs. Data is parsed from function arguments and internal method calls, notably in functions like create_time, time_difference, return_holidays, and date-based computations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be in date strings, country codes, or timezone inputs, which are parsed and used in date calculations. However, no direct sink allows untrusted data to influence system state or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs or external parameters into parsing functions, which convert strings or data into pendulum DateTime objects. These are then used for calculations or holiday lookups. No external data flows into system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution. The code primarily performs date calculations and holiday management without suspicious or hidden behavior. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard date/time libraries (pendulum) and holiday data without any manipulation or dangerous use. Functions handle input parsing, date computations, and holiday checks in a straightforward manner. No evidence of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms. The methods are well-structured for normal date operations, and no risky behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate date and holiday management library utilizing open-source packages. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. The implementation is consistent with standard date handling and holiday calculations, with no suspicious anomalies.",
