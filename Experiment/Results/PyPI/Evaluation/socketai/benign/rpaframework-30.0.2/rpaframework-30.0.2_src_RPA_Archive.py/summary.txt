  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented archive utility library with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The security risks are minimal and typical for file management tools, primarily related to misuse rather than inherent vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score around 0.1–0.2 is appropriate, reflecting standard operational risks without malicious intent."
