  "purpose": "A utility library for creating, listing, extracting, and modifying ZIP and TAR archive files, designed for file management tasks.",
  "sources": "File system directories and archive files (ZIP/TAR) for reading, writing, and modifying archive contents.",
  "sinks": "File paths used for extracting or adding files; no untrusted data sources or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "File system paths and patterns are used as input; files are read from disk and written into archives or extracted to disk; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard archive management functions utilizing Python's built-in libraries. It handles file creation, listing, extraction, and modification with proper context management. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's logic is straightforward, and the input/output handling appears safe assuming trusted inputs. The potential security concern is misuse of archive functions with untrusted data, but this is inherent to archive utilities and not indicative of malicious code. Overall, the implementation is robust and standard, with no indicators of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented archive utility library with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The security risks are minimal and typical for file management tools, primarily related to misuse rather than inherent vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score around 0.1–0.2 is appropriate, reflecting standard operational risks without malicious intent.",
