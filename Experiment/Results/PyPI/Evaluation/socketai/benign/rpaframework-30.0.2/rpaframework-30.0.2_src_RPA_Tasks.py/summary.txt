  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured task management and visualization library for Robot Framework. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage are evident. The primary concern is the execution of untrusted code via standard APIs, which is a known and accepted risk. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk (~0.2) is justified."
