  "purpose": "A Robot Framework library for task scheduling, validation via schema, and visualization using Graphviz.",
  "sources": "Reads schema files, task definitions, and suite data; executes Robot Framework keywords; performs file I/O and subprocess calls for graph rendering.",
  "sinks": "Outputs graph images, schema validation results, and logs; executes arbitrary Robot Framework keywords and evaluations which could run untrusted code if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Loads schemas, validates task transitions, schedules tasks, executes keywords, and renders graphs; dynamic evaluation and keyword execution influence task flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'BuiltIn().evaluate()' and 'run_keyword_and_return_status()' which can execute arbitrary code if inputs are untrusted; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured Robot Framework library managing tasks, schemas, and visualization. It relies on standard APIs and external libraries, with no malicious payloads or backdoors. The primary security concern is executing untrusted inputs via 'evaluate()' and 'run_keyword_and_return_status()', which could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but this is inherent to Robot Framework's design. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is present. The malware score is appropriately zero; the risk score is low (~0.2) due to potential misuse of dynamic execution functions, but not malicious in itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured task management and visualization library for Robot Framework. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage are evident. The primary concern is the execution of untrusted code via standard APIs, which is a known and accepted risk. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk (~0.2) is justified.",
