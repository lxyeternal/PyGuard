  "purpose": "The code provides a Python wrapper for Salesforce REST API, enabling authentication, data querying, CRUD operations, and data import/export functionalities. It is designed to facilitate Salesforce integrations within automation frameworks.",
  "sources": "File reads for JSON and mapping files, input parameters for API calls, environment variables for credentials, and network requests to Salesforce endpoints.",
  "sinks": "API request responses, data returned from Salesforce queries, and file outputs such as JSON files and tables.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from files or parameters into API request payloads; responses flow back into data structures or files. Credentials flow into authentication requests, and data flows from queries into tables or dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard libraries and patterns without unusual dynamic execution or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured Salesforce API client library. It handles authentication via token and connected app methods, performs queries, CRUD operations, and data import/export. No signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. It does not contain obfuscated code or suspicious patterns. The security measures are standard, and data handling appears secure. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Salesforce API wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It performs expected operations securely, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The low risk score is appropriate given its functionality.",
