{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python class for interacting with Salesforce via REST API, including authentication, querying, and object manipulation functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include reading from files (JSON, dictionaries, or tables), user input parameters, and API responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include API request construction (e.g., in auth methods, data creation/update), file writing (reading from files), and network requests to external Salesforce endpoints.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (files, parameters, user input) into API request payloads and method calls; responses are processed and returned as dictionaries or tables. Sensitive data like credentials flow into authentication requests; query results flow into data processing and potential storage or output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious variable naming were observed. The code uses standard libraries and patterns for API interaction and data handling. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; sensitive info is expected to be provided at runtime. No backdoors, hidden network connections, or malicious data exfiltration methods are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Salesforce API wrapper, implementing common functionalities such as authentication via token or connected app, CRUD operations, and query execution. It reads data from files or parameters, constructs API requests, and processes responses into structured formats. The code includes exception handling for authentication errors and data validation for input types. There are no signs of code injection, malicious data manipulation, or privacy violations. External network calls are limited to official Salesforce endpoints, and no suspicious external domains are contacted. The code does not contain any obfuscated logic or malicious payloads. All data flows are predictable and conform to expected API usage patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Salesforce API client library without any indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs legitimate API interactions, data processing, and file handling. No malicious signals, backdoors, or security risks are detected based on this analysis.",
