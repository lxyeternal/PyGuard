  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the evidence, logic, and scores provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard Salesforce API wrapper with common features.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. Uses standard libraries and patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, safe, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. No issues identified. The malware and obfuscated scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard Salesforce interactions.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses standard requests and API calls.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also deemed legitimate with high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a typical Salesforce API wrapper.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Uses standard API calls and JSON parsing.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, no malicious signals, high confidence (0.95). Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-founded conclusion, consistent scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard Salesforce data handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses standard libraries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, low suspicion, confidence 0.9. Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, comprehensive Salesforce wrapper.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9). Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports consistently find no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1–0.2) are reasonable given the code content.\n- The analysis is thorough, noting standard API interactions, proper handling of inputs, and absence of suspicious behaviors.\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the code's straightforward API wrapper nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) reflects low but non-zero potential risks, mainly due to external API interactions and data handling, which are standard for such libraries.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present, and the risk scores are appropriately low. The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented Salesforce API client library with no security concerns based on the provided information.",
