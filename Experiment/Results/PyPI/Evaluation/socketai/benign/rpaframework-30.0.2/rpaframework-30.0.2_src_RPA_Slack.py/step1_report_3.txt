  "purpose": "Library for sending messages to Slack via webhooks, primarily for RPA automation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: webhook_url, webhook, channel, sender, text, icon_emoji, message.",
  "sinks": "Requests are sent via requests.post() using input data (webhook URL, payload, message).",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters to HTTP POST request payloads sent to Slack webhooks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two methods for sending Slack messages: one with structured payloads and another with raw message content. Inputs are taken via method parameters, and data is sent over HTTP POST requests. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network activity detected. Logging is limited to debug statements of response status codes. Overall, the code appears to perform legitimate messaging functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for sending Slack messages using webhooks. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities was found.",
