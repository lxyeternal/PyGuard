  "purpose": "A library for sending messages to Slack channels via webhooks, supporting formatted and raw message types.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'webhook_url', 'channel', 'sender', 'text', and 'message'.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input data is sent via HTTP POST requests to the specified webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct JSON payloads, which are then sent to external Slack webhooks using HTTP POST requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. Logging of response status is standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing methods to send Slack messages using webhooks. It accepts user input for message content, channel, and optional icon. The HTTP requests are made using the 'requests' library without any suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of 'requests.post' with user-supplied URLs is standard for webhook communication, and there is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities within this scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a Slack messaging utility without any malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles input parameters and performs straightforward HTTP POST requests to user-defined webhook URLs. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security threats in this code.",
