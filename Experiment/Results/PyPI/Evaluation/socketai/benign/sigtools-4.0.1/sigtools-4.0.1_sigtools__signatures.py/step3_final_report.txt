  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for manipulating Python function signatures, including upgrading annotations, merging signatures, masking parameters, embedding signatures, and handling parameter sources. It is primarily used for signature analysis and transformation.",
  "sources": "Function objects, parameters, annotations, signature objects, globals, globals, globals, class attributes, and external signature inputs.",
  "sinks": "eval() call in `_PostponedAnnotation.source_value()` which executes `raw_annotation`.",
  "flows": "Untrusted `raw_annotation` flows into eval(), which executes code if annotations are maliciously supplied.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on `raw_annotation` for deferred annotation evaluation, which can execute arbitrary code if annotations are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code is a signature manipulation utility that relies on eval() to evaluate deferred annotations. The primary security concern is that if `raw_annotation` is supplied from an untrusted source, eval() could execute malicious code. The rest of the code appears to be standard signature handling with no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation. The eval() pattern is a known, though risky, approach for deferred evaluation per PEP 563. No other suspicious behaviors or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for signature analysis and transformation, with the main security risk stemming from eval() executing potentially malicious annotations. There is no evidence of malicious intent or payloads. The malware score should be increased slightly to reflect the eval() risk, and the security risk score should be considered moderate to high if annotations can be influenced externally.",
