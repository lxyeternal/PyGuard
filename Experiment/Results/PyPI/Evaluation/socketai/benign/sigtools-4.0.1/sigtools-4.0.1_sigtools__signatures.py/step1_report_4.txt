  "purpose": "Collection of Python modules for manipulating function signatures, including upgrading annotations, merging, embedding, and masking signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (__future__, sys, types, itertools, collections, functools, typing, warnings, attr, and sigtools._util); uses class and function parameters, global constants, and attributes; evaluates annotations dynamically with eval; accesses function globals.",
  "sinks": "Uses eval in _PostponedAnnotation.source_value() to evaluate annotations, which could potentially execute arbitrary code if annotations are maliciously crafted. Also modifies signature objects and parameters, but does not perform system calls, network operations, or file access.",
  "flows": "Source: eval in _PostponedAnnotation.source_value() reads annotation code; flow occurs when source_value() is called, evaluating raw annotations potentially containing malicious code. Other data flows involve manipulating signature parameters and sources but do not lead to external system effects.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval() on raw annotation data in _PostponedAnnotation.source_value(), which is a common vector for code execution if annotations are malicious. No other suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors are detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features beyond eval().",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive module for signature manipulation, with a focus on annotation upgrades and signature merging. The key point of concern is the eval() call in _PostponedAnnotation.source_value(), which can execute arbitrary code if the annotation is maliciously crafted. All other functions operate on data structures, signatures, and parameters without external side effects or system calls. The code appears well-structured and documented, with no signs of hidden malicious intent. The eval() usage is a potential security risk but not inherently malicious—its threat depends on how annotations are sourced and whether untrusted data can reach eval().",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a signature manipulation library with a notable potential security risk due to the use of eval() on annotation data, which could execute malicious code if annotations are untrusted. There are no signs of deliberate malware or sabotage, but the eval() pattern warrants caution if annotations come from untrusted sources.",
