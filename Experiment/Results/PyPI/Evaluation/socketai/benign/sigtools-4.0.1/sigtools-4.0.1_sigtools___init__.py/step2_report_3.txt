  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is primarily composed of licensing comments, a declaration of `__all__`, and an import statement:\n     ```python\n     from sigtools.specifiers import signature\n     ```\n   - There are no dynamic behaviors, user inputs, network operations, or data processing.\n   - The import is straightforward and appears to be a standard component of a library module.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior Assessment:**\n   - The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The import statement does not execute untrusted code or perform any side effects that could be malicious.\n   - The licensing comments are standard for open-source projects and do not indicate any malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Reported as 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 or very close to it; no security risks are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with confidence scores of 1, and no anomalies or suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that importing `signature` from `sigtools.specifiers` is safe, which, given the context, appears reasonable.\n   - No evidence suggests that `sigtools.specifiers.signature` contains malicious code; such concerns would require inspecting that module directly.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign module setup for an open-source library.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet does not pose any security threat or malicious activity risk.",
