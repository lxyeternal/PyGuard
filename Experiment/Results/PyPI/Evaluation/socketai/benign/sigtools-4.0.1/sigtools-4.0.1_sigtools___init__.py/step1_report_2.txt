  "purpose": "This code is a module documentation and import statement for the 'sigtools' package, aimed at manipulating function signatures.",
  "sources": "The code reads static text (comments), and imports 'signature' from 'sigtools.specifiers'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or execution flow involving user input or untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports a module component.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed; only standard licensing comments and a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing comments and a single import statement for a specific module component. There are no dynamic code execution, no input handling, no network operations, nor any code that could be malicious. The import appears to be for legitimate functionality related to function signature manipulation. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of licensing comments and a standard import statement. There is no indication of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
