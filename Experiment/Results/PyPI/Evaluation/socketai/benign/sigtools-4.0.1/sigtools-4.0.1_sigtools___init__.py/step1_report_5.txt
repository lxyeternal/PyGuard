{
  "purpose": "To provide a module that exposes function signature manipulation features, specifically importing the 'signature' component from sigtools.specifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module file, imports from sigtools.specifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or cause side effects are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable; the code only performs import operations and defines a list.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. The license and copyright information are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains license information, a list defining exported functions, and a simple import statement. There are no dynamic code executions, no data input/output operations, and no suspicious behavior. The import of 'signature' is standard for a module designed to re-export or utilize functionality from another module. No signs of malicious or maliciously intended code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module containing licensing info, a public interface declaration, and a straightforward import statement. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
