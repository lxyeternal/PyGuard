{
  "purpose": "The code is a module for manipulating function signatures, providing importable functions or objects related to signatures.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own comments and metadata, and imports the 'signature' object from 'sigtools.specifiers'.",
  "sinks": "The imported 'signature' could be used downstream in potentially unsafe ways if misused, but there are no explicit sinks in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present in this code snippet; it primarily contains metadata and an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for a library module.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing comments, defines an exported attribute '__all__', and imports 'signature' from a local module 'sigtools.specifiers'. There is no user input, no external data processing, and no complex logic. The import statement is standard, and the license comments are typical for open-source projects. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign open-source library module for signature manipulation, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
