  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard Python module with licensing comments, an `__all__` declaration, and an import statement.\n- All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The imported object `signature` from `sigtools.specifiers` is likely a legitimate part of the library, possibly a function or class for signature manipulation.\n- No user input, external data processing, or network activity is present.\n- The code is static and straightforward, with no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. The code appears benign and free of vulnerabilities, malware, or suspicious constructs.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  None. The code is standard, well-documented, and minimal.\n\n### Scores assigned:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there's no malware, obfuscation, or security concern, the scores are appropriately set to 0.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, well-documented module with no malicious intent, no suspicious patterns, and no external untrusted data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a standard, benign open-source module setup. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Keep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.  \n- No additional security review is necessary for this snippet.\n\n**Note:** Always consider the context of the entire project, but based solely on this snippet, the security posture is sound.",
