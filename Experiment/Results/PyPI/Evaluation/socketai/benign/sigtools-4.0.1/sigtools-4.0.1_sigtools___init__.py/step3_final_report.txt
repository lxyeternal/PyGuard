{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that re-exports the 'signature' object from the 'sigtools.specifiers' package, likely for use in other parts of the library or project.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from sigtools.specifiers import signature' reads the 'signature' object from the specified module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code, as it does not process untrusted data or perform any data output operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing 'signature' from the module, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with licensing comments, an __all__ declaration, and a simple import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, well-documented Python module that imports a specific object from a package and exposes it via __all__. There are no dynamic behaviors, no user input handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The import appears standard, and the code is static and benign. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with no obfuscation or security issues. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
