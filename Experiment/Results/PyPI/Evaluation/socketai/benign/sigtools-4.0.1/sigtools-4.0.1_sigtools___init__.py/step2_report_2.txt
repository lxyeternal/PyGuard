  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, benign Python module consisting of licensing comments, an `__all__` declaration, and an import statement for `signature` from `sigtools.specifiers`.\n- No reports identify any dynamic code, user input handling, network operations, or other potentially risky behaviors.\n- The code appears to be a typical module initialization or interface file, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The import statement `from sigtools.specifiers import signature` is standard and does not inherently pose security risks.\n- The `__all__` list exposes only `'signature'`, which is consistent with a module that re-exports functionality.\n- No suspicious patterns, anomalies, or indications of malware are evident across all reports.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports do not mention whether the imported `signature` could contain malicious code. However, since this is an import statement and the code is a module setup, the risk depends on the content of `sigtools.specifiers.signature`. Without inspecting that, we cannot assume maliciousness.\n- The reports correctly do not assume any malicious behavior based solely on this snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, open-source module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security issues identified)\n\n**Final note:** To fully assess potential maliciousness, one would need to review the actual implementation of `sigtools.specifiers.signature`. Based on this snippet alone, the code is benign.",
