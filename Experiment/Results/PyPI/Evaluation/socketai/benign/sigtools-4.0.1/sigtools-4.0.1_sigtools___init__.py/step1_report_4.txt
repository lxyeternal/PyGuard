{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a collection of Python modules for manipulating function signatures, likely used as a utility library for other code that deals with function signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports 'signature' from 'sigtools.specifiers', which may involve external code handling signatures.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects; no functions or operations processing external input in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here, as the code mainly consists of imports and metadata comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a straightforward module with licensing comments, imports, and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily metadata, licensing, and import statements. It defines an exported symbol '__all__' with 'signature'. No data processing, input handling, or potentially dangerous operations are present. The imported 'signature' may contain further logic, but within this snippet, there is no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It only contains license information, module export declaration, and a safe import statement.",
