{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility classes and functions for analyzing, manipulating, and forwarding function signatures in Python, likely for static analysis or code transformation tasks related to signatures.",
  "sources": "Reads source code from 'ast' module parsing, and inputs from function objects, AST nodes, and runtime data structures such as __globals__, __closure__, __code__, __args__, __kwargs__.",
  "sinks": "Uses function attributes, AST attribute resolution, dynamic attribute access (getattr), and interactions with function globals and closures to resolve names and call parameters.",
  "flows": "Source: AST nodes and function objects -> resolve_name function resolves names from AST or runtime globals/closures -> process_Call and resolve_name flow to produce function call representations -> forwarding functions resolve and manipulate signatures based on call data.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs complex name resolution including dynamic attribute and global lookups, which could be misused to access sensitive data or perform malicious actions if the input code is malicious. No explicit hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. Usage of get_attr and global access could be exploited if the input code is crafted maliciously, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly implements a static analysis framework for Python functions and their signatures, including name resolution across AST and runtime contexts, call collection, and signature forwarding. It carefully handles AST nodes and function internals to analyze call flows. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. No functions send data over network, modify system files, or perform any harm. The only potential concern is the extensive dynamic name resolution and attribute access which could be misused in malicious contexts, but the code itself is a library for analysis, not execution of untrusted code. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a utility library for function signature analysis and forwarding, with no evidence of malicious behavior. Its complexity and dynamic resolution could be misused in an attacker’s context, but the code itself appears benign and solely focused on static and runtime analysis. No malware or security risks are identified.",
