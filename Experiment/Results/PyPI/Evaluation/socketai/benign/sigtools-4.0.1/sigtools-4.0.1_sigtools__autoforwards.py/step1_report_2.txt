{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for analyzing and manipulating Python function signatures and call sites, including signature forwarding and resolution of names within ASTs.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function AST nodes, function objects, and call AST nodes, primarily from Python code analysis or introspection.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are resolution of names to globals, attributes, or closure variables, and handling of function calls, which could be misused to execute untrusted code if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input AST nodes or function objects to name resolution, attribute access, and function call processing, potentially leading to dynamic evaluation or attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obvious malicious code patterns detected. The code uses extensive name and attribute resolution, which could be exploited if supplied with malicious AST nodes or manipulated input structures, but no specific malicious behavior or sabotage evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static analysis and resolution of function signatures and call graphs. It imports standard and third-party libraries for AST parsing and signature handling. The name resolution functions can resolve names from globals, closure, or attributes, and process function calls, including forwarding signatures. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution (like eval or exec), no network activity, and no data exfiltration code are present. The only potential risk is the processing of untrusted AST nodes, which could be misused in a broader context, but as standalone, no malicious intent is apparent. The code adheres to standard analysis practices without suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard static analysis and signature forwarding utility for Python functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely within the bounds of code introspection and signature resolution, without executing untrusted code or exfiltrating data.",
