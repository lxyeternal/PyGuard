  "purpose": "A utility library for analyzing, manipulating, and forwarding Python function signatures through AST parsing and runtime introspection.",
  "sources": "AST nodes, function objects, globals, closures, attributes",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute access, global lookups, name resolution, call collection",
  "flows": "From AST nodes and function objects to name resolution, attribute access, and call analysis",
  "anomalies": "Extensive dynamic name resolution and AST processing, potential misuse if fed malicious inputs, but no malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code performs static and runtime analysis of Python functions, resolving names across various scopes, parsing ASTs, and forwarding calls. It does not execute untrusted code or perform network/file operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The dynamic resolution could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is a standard utility for signature analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for function signature analysis and forwarding. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The potential for misuse exists if malicious inputs are provided, but this does not constitute inherent security risk.",
