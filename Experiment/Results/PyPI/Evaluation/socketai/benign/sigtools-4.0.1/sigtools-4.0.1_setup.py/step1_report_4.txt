  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'sigtools' including metadata, dependencies, and test configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long_description, defining dependencies in 'tests_deps' and 'install_requires', and static data in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; all data used is static or file input for documentation.",
  "flows": "Reading README content -> Passing static data into setup() -> No flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected; standard setup script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and reads a README file to include a long description. It defines dependencies for testing and installation statically. The setup() function contains package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no user inputs, environment variable manipulations, or dynamic code execution. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure follows typical Python packaging conventions without anomalies or suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
