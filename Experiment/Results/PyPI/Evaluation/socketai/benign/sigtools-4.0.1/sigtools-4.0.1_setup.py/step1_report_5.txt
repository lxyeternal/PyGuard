{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the sigtools Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long_description, static lists for dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are hardcoded and sourced from static files or variables.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file feeds into long_description; static dependency lists used for install_requires and extras_require.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file, defines dependencies, and sets package metadata. There are no input validation, dynamic code generation, network activity, or data leaks. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code is straightforward and typical of package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely handles package metadata and dependencies in a standard manner.",
