  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package 'sigtools', defining dependencies, metadata, and package details.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst for long description; importing setup from setuptools; defining dependencies and package info.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external input/output besides static file reading.",
  "flows": "Static data flow: file reading for description, dependency lists, and package metadata; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. It reads a static README file, defines dependencies, and specifies package metadata. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no use of dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. It follows typical package setup conventions with no signs of malicious activity or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
