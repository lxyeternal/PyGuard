  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'sigtools' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and test configurations.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long_description; defining dependencies in lists; setting package metadata and requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or external data sources are processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration data is static and read-only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard setup.py usage with no obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading a README file, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. It does not include any network activity, code execution from untrusted sources, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
