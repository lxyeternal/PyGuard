  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file, static assignment of dependencies and metadata",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only",
  "flows": "Reading README -> setup configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no dynamic or malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that reads a README file and defines package metadata and dependencies. It does not execute any dynamic code, handle user input, perform network operations, or include obfuscated or malicious code. All dependencies and configurations are statically defined. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present. The code structure and logic are typical for Python packaging scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The overall security assessment is that the package is safe for use.",
