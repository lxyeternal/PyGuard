{
  "purpose": "This module provides utilities for manipulating function signatures, introspection, and related reflection features in Python.",
  "sources": "Reading function objects (__code__, __signature__, __autoforwards_hint__, __forger__), inspecting source code via inspect.getsource, and attribute access on various objects.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe source code retrieval via inspect.getsource; attribute access on user-provided objects; usage of eval-like functions indirectly through ast parsing; no explicit data sinks performing harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input: function objects or source code -> process via introspection or source retrieval -> parse AST or retrieve signatures -> output processed data or modified function wrappers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.getsource on code objects, which may be manipulated or crafted source; functions like get_introspectable checking multiple attributes; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity observed; multiple redefinitions of partial_ variable, which is benign but unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on inspecting and manipulating function signatures and source code, using standard Python reflection modules like inspect and ast. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors is present. Some features, like retrieving source code and introspecting functions, could potentially be misused if supplied with malicious objects, but there is no active malicious payload. The code is mostly standard utility functions with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The redefinition of partial_ appears redundant but benign. Overall, the code appears to serve as a reflective utility library with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a utility library for function and source introspection. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware signatures. The code uses standard Python features for reflection and introspection without any evident malicious payload or sabotage. The presence of source code retrieval functions does not imply malicious intent, and no suspicious activity is detected.",
