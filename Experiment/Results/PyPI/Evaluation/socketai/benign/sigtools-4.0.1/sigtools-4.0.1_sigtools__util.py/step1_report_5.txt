  "purpose": "Collection of Python modules for manipulating function signatures and introspection utilities",
  "sources": "Imports: inspect, ast, functools, weakref, collections; Functions: get_funcsigs, get_ast, iter_call, get_introspectable, etc.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; functions primarily perform introspection, object attribute access, and wrapper creation",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., functions, objects) flows through attribute access and introspection methods, but no untrusted data processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.getsource on code objects, but no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for function signature inspection and object attribute management. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration present. Use of WeakKeyDictionary and custom descriptors appears benign. No obfuscation or malware patterns detected. The code is consistent with its stated purpose and does not include suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility library for introspection and signature manipulation, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
