  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for introspection and signature handling. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is justified due to source code exposure potential, but no active malicious behavior is present. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as 0. The overall security posture is safe."
