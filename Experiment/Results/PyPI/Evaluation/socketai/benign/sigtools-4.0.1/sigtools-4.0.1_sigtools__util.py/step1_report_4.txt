{
  "purpose": "This module provides utilities for manipulating function signatures and introspection, including handling signatures, qualified names, and callables.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules (inspect, ast, functools, weakref, collections), and internal functions that access object attributes or source code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include use of inspect.getsource() and access to function code objects, which could reveal source code or metadata. No explicit untrusted data sink is found.",
  "flows": "The function get_ast() retrieves source code from functions and parses it into an AST, which could leak source code if untrusted functions are passed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are observed. The code uses standard introspection and utility functions. No obfuscated code is present. No hidden or malicious behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known modules and defines utility functions for introspection and signature handling. The get_funcsigs() function switches between inspect.signature and funcsigs, which is standard. The get_ast() function retrieves source code and parses it into an AST, potentially exposing source code but not inherently malicious. The class OverrideableDataDesc manages descriptor behavior with weak references. There are no signs of code injection, network activity, or backdoors. The functions operate purely on provided objects, with no external input handling or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions for Python introspection and signature manipulation, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard libraries and performs safe operations. No malware or security issues are identified.",
