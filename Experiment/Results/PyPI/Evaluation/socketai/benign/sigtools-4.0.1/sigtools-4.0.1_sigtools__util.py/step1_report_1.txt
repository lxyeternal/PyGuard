{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for inspecting and manipulating function signatures and related metadata, primarily used in Python code analysis and introspection.",
  "sources": "Reads function objects, code objects, and source code via attributes like __code__, __signature__, and using inspect.getsource.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code does not process external inputs or data in a way that leads to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves function signatures, source code, and wraps functions for introspection purposes. It flows mainly involve reading function attributes and source code, with no evident data flow to external systems or untrusted destinations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code uses standard introspection techniques, and no obfuscated code or unusual patterns are present. All modules and functions appear to serve legitimate purposes related to function signature analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions and classes for introspecting Python functions, signatures, and source code. It imports standard modules like inspect, ast, and functools, and handles potential missing modules gracefully. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The use of WeakKeyDictionary and custom descriptors is consistent with legitimate introspection functionality. No hidden or obfuscated behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility library for function and source code introspection. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, and it appears to be a legitimate component for analyzing Python functions. No security risks or malware are evident.",
