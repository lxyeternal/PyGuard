  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a benign utility library for function signature and source code introspection. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5 (initially 0, but considering the overall benign nature, perhaps slightly higher but still low).\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the use of introspection, source retrieval, and reflection. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. Slight concern about potential misuse if supplied malicious objects, but no active malicious payload.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (slightly elevated due to potential misuse).\n- **Assessment:** The code remains benign. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Utility functions for introspection, no evidence of malicious behavior. Use of reflection and dynamic attribute access is standard for such utilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Clearly benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Focused on introspection, source code retrieval, and signature handling. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (due to source code exposure potential).\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent, just standard introspection utilities.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar utility functions, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** No. All reports confirm that the code is a set of introspection utilities.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malware, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only slight concern is source code retrieval via `inspect.getsource()`, which could leak source if used maliciously, but this is a standard reflection capability, not malicious per se.\n- **Scores:** Given the above, I would assign:\n  - **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n  - **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, due to reflection capabilities that could be misused if exploited maliciously, but no active threat here)\n\n### Final estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code appears to be a legitimate utility library for introspection, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
