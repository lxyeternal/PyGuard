  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for function signatures and introspection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks for untrusted data; mainly reads function attributes and source code.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Uses standard introspection techniques; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code, no malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- SecurityRisk: 0 (no evident risks)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar introspection utilities; reads function objects, source code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potentially unsafe source code retrieval, but no active malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies:** Redundant redefinition of `partial_`, but benign.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent; standard reflection code.\n- **Conclusion:** Utility library with no malicious payload.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (slightly elevated due to source code retrieval, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for signatures and introspection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar to above; no external data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard reflection code, benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Functions for source code retrieval and AST parsing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Source code retrieval could expose source code, but not malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent; standard introspection.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility functions.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (due to source code access, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for introspection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks; mainly attribute access.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports indicate no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.2), mainly due to source code access, but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The overall **malware score** should be **0** across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains **0**.\n- The **security risk** should stay low, around **0.1 to 0.2**, primarily due to the use of source code inspection functions, which could theoretically be misused but are standard in utility libraries.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, mainly due to source code access, but no malicious intent)\n\nThis code appears to be a legitimate, standard utility library for introspection and signature manipulation, with no security concerns or malware detected.",
