  "purpose": "Utility functions for function signature introspection, source code retrieval, and metadata handling in Python.",
  "sources": "Reads function objects, code objects, source code via inspect, and function attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; primarily reads attributes and source code, with potential source code exposure.",
  "flows": "Source objects (functions, code, partials) are inspected; source code may be retrieved for introspection purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; redundant definitions of 'partial_' but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Python introspection tasks using built-in modules. It retrieves function signatures, source code, and manages function metadata. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The source code retrieval via 'inspect.getsource()' could expose source code if misused, but this is a standard feature of Python's reflection capabilities. The code is straightforward, with clear variable names and no obfuscation. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for introspection and signature handling. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is justified due to source code exposure potential, but no active malicious behavior is present. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as 0. The overall security posture is safe.",
