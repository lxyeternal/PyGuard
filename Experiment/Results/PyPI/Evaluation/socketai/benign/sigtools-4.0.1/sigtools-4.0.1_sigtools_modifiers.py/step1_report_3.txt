{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and utilities to modify function signatures, marking parameters as keyword-only or positional-only, and to annotate functions without using Python 3 syntax.",
  "sources": "The code reads function signatures via '_specifiers.forged_signature', and inspects ASTs via '_util.get_ast'. It also reads function parameters and attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies function signatures and annotations, and raises exceptions if inputs are invalid. No external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters and AST inspection to signature modifications and validation. There is no data flow to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The code structure is consistent with signature modification utilities. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators and classes for function signature manipulation, including marking parameters as keyword-only or positional-only and annotating functions. It uses standard Python modules such as 'functools' and custom modules '_util', '_specifiers', '_signatures' to access signatures and ASTs. Validation steps ensure parameters are correctly marked and signatures are reconstructed properly. There are no indications of malicious logic such as network activity, data theft, or system manipulation. The code appears to serve a purely functional role for signature handling. No suspicious anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for modifying and annotating function signatures in Python. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious external interactions, and adheres to safe practices. It is unlikely to pose security risks.",
