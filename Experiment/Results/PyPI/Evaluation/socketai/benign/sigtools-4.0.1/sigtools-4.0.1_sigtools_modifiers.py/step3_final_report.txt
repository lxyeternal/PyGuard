{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and classes for modifying function signatures, marking parameters as keyword-only or positional-only, and annotating parameters, primarily for use in Python signature manipulation and enforcement.",
  "sources": "Reads function signatures via internal modules (_specifiers, _signatures), AST inspection, and function objects; no external data sources or untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration points; signature modifications are internal and do not involve external systems.",
  "flows": "Signature inspection and modification flow from function objects to internal signature representations, with no external data flow or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility module for signature manipulation, including decorators for marking parameters as keyword-only or positional-only, and for annotating parameters. It uses standard introspection and signature handling techniques, with no external data handling or malicious patterns. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The code's purpose is benign, and it does not perform any network, file, or system operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for function signature modification and annotation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this.",
