{
  "purpose": "This module provides decorators and utilities for modifying Python function signatures, such as marking parameters as keyword-only or positional-only, and annotating functions without using Python 3 syntax.",
  "sources": "Code reads function signatures, function objects, and source code ASTs for signature modification and annotation.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted external input; no network, file, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Signature-related source data flows through signature forging, parameter replacement, and decorator wrapping; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code structure and comments are consistent with typical decorator and signature manipulation patterns. The presence of partial function handling and signature replacement is standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a set of decorators (_PokTranslator, kwoargs, posoargs, autokwoargs, annotate) for modifying function signatures to enforce keyword-only or positional-only parameters and add annotations. It uses standard Python introspection tools, such as inspecting signatures and ASTs, without any external network or data handling. The functions include input validation, signature forging, and signature replacement, all of which are typical and do not involve malicious behavior. There are no signs of hidden or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code's structure and comments are consistent with open-source signature manipulation utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of function signature decorators and modifiers, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be legitimate utility code intended for use in Python codebases to enforce signature patterns.",
