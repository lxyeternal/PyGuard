{
  "purpose": "This module provides decorators and utility functions for manipulating Python function signatures, especially for forwarding or modifying signatures to improve introspection or documentation.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from function objects, class attributes, and method calls (e.g., function signatures, attribute lookups, class/method names, code objects).",
  "sinks": "Signature modifications, attribute deletions, and dynamic method wrapping are the primary sinks. No clear data leaks or unsafe data handling are observed.",
  "flows": "Input from function objects or class attributes (sources) flows through decorators and utility functions that modify or wrap functions/methods to adjust signatures, including dynamic signature forging and forwarding.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obfuscated constructs, unusual code patterns, or hidden logic. Use of dynamic attribute manipulation and function wrapping is standard for signature modification purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several decorators and classes to modify function signatures, including forging signatures and forwarding arguments. It employs standard Python features such as descriptors, partial functions, and attribute manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The functions operate solely on function signatures and object attributes, with no indication of malicious intent. The use of dynamic signature forging and forwarding appears to be for improving introspection or documentation, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility library for signature manipulation with no malicious or sabotage intent. It leverages Python's introspection and decorator features for enhancing function signatures. No security risks or malware behaviors are detected.",
