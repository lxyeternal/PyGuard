  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured utility library for function signature manipulation in Python. It employs standard metaprogramming techniques without any signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the overall security assessment is that the code is safe for use in open source projects."
