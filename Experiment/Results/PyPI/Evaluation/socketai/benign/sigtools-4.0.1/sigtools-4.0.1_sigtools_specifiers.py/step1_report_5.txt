{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and utilities for manipulating function signatures, especially for forwarding signatures in class methods and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from functools, sigtools modules, and the code itself reading function objects, class objects, and their attributes.",
  "sinks": "Calls to signature() which inspects functions; attribute access/modification such as __signature__, __self__, __name__; dynamic function wrapping and attribute setting; partial function creation.",
  "flows": "Function definitions and decorators capture or modify signatures by inspecting objects (sources), then wrap or set attributes that influence function signatures or call behavior (sinks). For example, set_signature_forger sets a custom signature generator; forwards_to_method and others wrap functions to alter __signature__ based on other callables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of dynamic attribute manipulation and signature modification is consistent with intended reflective functionality. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a library for signature manipulation, primarily for better introspection and documentation. It uses reflection (inspect.signature, attribute modifications) and function wrapping (functools.update_wrapper, partial). There are no external inputs or untrusted data sources, and no code executes external commands or network operations. Signature manipulation can be misused if misapplied, but the code itself is standard and safe. No indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware functions are present. The signature and attribute handling is typical for advanced introspection utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility library for managing function signatures and forwarding behaviors, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It is well-structured for its purpose, without malicious anomalies. Overall security risk is low.",
