  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility for signature forging and forwarding, using standard reflection and signature manipulation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Modifies function signatures, attribute deletion, and wrapping; no external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious patterns. Uses reflection for signature forging, which is legitimate metaprogramming.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate utility library. Malware score: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose—signature manipulation for introspection/documentation.\n- No suspicious code, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- Uses reflection and dynamic wrapping for signature purposes.\n- **Conclusion:** Also legitimate. Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focused on forwarding signatures, dynamic wrapping, and signature forging.\n- Uses attribute deletion, reflection, and standard Python techniques.\n- No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate. Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous reports—signature forging and forwarding utilities.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe. Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Utility for signature manipulation and forwarding, employing reflection and standard wrapping.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate. Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code relies on standard reflection, function wrapping, and signature forging—common in metaprogramming utilities. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.  \n  **Estimated malware score: 0.0**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. Uses standard Python features openly.  \n  **Estimated obfuscated score: 0.0**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The highest risk identified is very low, primarily because the code manipulates signatures and wraps functions, which could be misused if misapplied but are standard practices. No external dependencies or dangerous operations are present.  \n  **Estimated risk score: 0.1 to 0.2**\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a legitimate utility for function signature manipulation, commonly used for improving introspection, documentation, or forwarding arguments in decorators and class methods.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The operations performed are standard for metaprogramming and introspection in Python.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n\n| Category          | Score  |\n|-------------------|---------|\n| Malware           | 0.0     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.0     |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1     |\n\nThese scores reflect a high confidence that the code is safe, transparent, and intended for legitimate purposes.",
