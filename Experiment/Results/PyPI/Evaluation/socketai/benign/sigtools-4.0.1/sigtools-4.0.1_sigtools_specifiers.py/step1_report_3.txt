{
  "purpose": "This module provides decorators and utilities to manipulate function signatures, especially for forwarding arguments to other callables or class methods, enhancing introspection and documentation capabilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (functools), local modules (_util, modifiers, signatures, _specifiers), and function definitions that process function objects and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Calls to `signature(obj)` and `_signature_forger` attribute manipulations, attribute deletions (`del self.__signature__`, `del self._sigtools__forger`), and dynamic function wrapping.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters (e.g., `obj`, `func`, `wrapped`, `instance`) into signature processing functions (`signature`, `signatures.forwards`), which generate or modify function signatures. These signatures are used in decorators that modify or wrap functions or objects, with potential flow from decorators to wrapped objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors are observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code injections. The code uses standard practices for signature manipulation and function wrapping.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines utilities for signature forging, wrapping functions, and forwarding argument signatures, using standard Python features and well-known libraries. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is detected. The use of `del` on attributes and dynamic class creation is typical for signature manipulation. The functions seem to serve legitimate purposes related to introspection, documentation, and function forwarding.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate library for enhancing function signature handling and forwarding in Python. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no evident security issues or malware. Overall, this package is safe based on the provided code.",
