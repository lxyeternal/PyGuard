  "purpose": "Utilities for signature forging, forwarding, and manipulation, enabling introspection and documentation enhancements for Python callables.",
  "sources": "Reflection, attribute access, function decorators, dynamic attribute modification, and signature forging functions.",
  "sinks": "Signature creation, attribute deletion, function wrapping, and attribute access that could potentially be misused if misapplied, but no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Signature functions and decorators read object signatures, modify attributes, and wrap functions to produce altered signatures for introspection or documentation purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no malicious code, no suspicious patterns; standard use of reflection and decorators for metaprogramming.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python techniques such as reflection, decorators, and dynamic attribute management to manipulate function signatures for forwarding and forging purposes. It includes safeguards against recursive signature computation and uses well-documented patterns. No external data inputs, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The code's structure and comments indicate legitimate utility functions aimed at improving introspection and documentation. The absence of obfuscation and malicious patterns supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured utility library for function signature manipulation in Python. It employs standard metaprogramming techniques without any signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the overall security assessment is that the code is safe for use in open source projects.",
