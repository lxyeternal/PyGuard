{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for manipulating function signatures, especially for creating decorators that forward or modify signatures of other functions or methods. It aims to enhance introspection and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (functools), and internal modules (sigtools._util, modifiers, signatures, _specifiers). No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, network communication, file operations, or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "The code constructs signatures and decorators that modify or generate function signatures, mainly for introspection purposes. No data flow to external systems or sensitive data leakage points are identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a well-structured utility module for signature manipulation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. No obfuscation or hidden malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The module defines decorators and utility functions for forging and setting function signatures, including advanced features like forwarding signatures to other callables or methods, and wrapping objects to present custom signatures. The code employs standard libraries and internal modules, with no signs of malicious behavior. It strictly focuses on signature manipulation and decoration, with no network, file, or system access. No anomalies such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward and consistent with its documented purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate signature manipulation utility for Python functions and methods, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only performs introspection, decoration, and signature forging, aligning with its purpose.",
