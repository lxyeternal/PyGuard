{
  "purpose": "Provides decorators and utilities to manipulate and forge function signatures, especially for forwarding arguments in class methods and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'sigtools', use of 'partial', 'update_wrapper', and reflection via __name__, __signature__, __self__, __closure__, __code__ attributes.",
  "sinks": "Signature functions and attribute modifications that could potentially influence introspection; no explicit sinks for untrusted data or external network interaction.",
  "flows": "Uses signature forging functions to produce or modify signatures; flows are mainly within the signature creation, wrapping, and attribute setting mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code relies on standard Python reflection and function wrapping techniques. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utilities for signature manipulation and forwarding, employing standard Python features like functools, reflection, and dynamic class modification. No external data input, network calls, or system modifications are present. Signature forging and decoration are typical, safe operations. The code is well-structured, documented, and uses standard libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only notable aspect is the use of reflection for signature manipulation, which is a legitimate metaprogramming technique, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a legitimate utility library for function signature manipulation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard Python features for introspection and wrapping, serving its purpose in signature handling and forwarding. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
