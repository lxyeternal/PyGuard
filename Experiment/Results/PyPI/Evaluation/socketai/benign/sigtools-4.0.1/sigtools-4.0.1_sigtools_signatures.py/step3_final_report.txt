  "purpose": "This module provides high-level functions for manipulating function signatures within the 'sigtools' library, serving as an interface to internal signature operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the internal module 'sigtools._signatures'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or user input handling.",
  "flows": "Import from internal module -> expose via __all__ for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import/export pattern, clear documentation, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific functions and classes from an internal module and exposes them via __all__. It contains licensing and documentation comments. There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, or obfuscated constructs. The internal module is assumed to be part of the same package, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The code's simplicity and structure indicate it is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for signature manipulation functions within the 'sigtools' library. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the static and straightforward nature of the code.",
