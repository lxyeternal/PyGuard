  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python module that imports functions and classes from an internal module (`sigtools._signatures`) and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- It contains licensing, documentation, and no dynamic or external data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The import source is an internal module, likely part of the same package, with no indication of external or untrusted sources.\n- No user input, network activity, or data sinks are involved.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Confirms benign nature; no anomalies, malware, or security risks.  \n   - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Same conclusion: straightforward module wrapper, no risks.  \n   - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n   - Justified given the code's structure.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Same as above; no issues detected.  \n   - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Same conclusion; standard module setup, no malicious behavior.  \n   - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Same consistent assessment; no anomalies or risks.  \n   - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports correctly identify that there's no malicious code or behavior. The code is purely import/export setup with no dynamic execution or external data handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score justification:** Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the provided code snippet and reports.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. The reports' assessments are consistent and accurate.",
