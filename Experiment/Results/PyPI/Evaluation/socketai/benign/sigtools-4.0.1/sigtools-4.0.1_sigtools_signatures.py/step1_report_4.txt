  "purpose": "Collection of Python modules for manipulating function signatures, primarily used for high-level signature operations and decorators.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'sigtools._signatures' module",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or can lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Imports from a local module; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the module is primarily for exporting functions and classes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is mainly a straightforward module import and definition block with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing comments, documentation strings, and an import statement from a private module within the package. The imported symbols are exported via __all__. No data processing, user input, or external data sources are present. The structure is typical for a Python module setting up exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup for a Python package focused on signature manipulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment.",
