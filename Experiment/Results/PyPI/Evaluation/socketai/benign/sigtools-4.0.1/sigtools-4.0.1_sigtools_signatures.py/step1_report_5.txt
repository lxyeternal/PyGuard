  "purpose": "Collection of Python modules for manipulating function signatures, providing high-level operations and signature combination functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import of functions and classes from the internal module 'sigtools._signatures'. No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points identified; the code mainly re-exports imported functions.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted input; the code only imports and exposes functions/classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is primarily documentation, licensing, and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a license, descriptive docstring, and imports from a private module 'sigtools._signatures'. It does not process external data, execute dynamic code, or perform any operations that could be malicious. There are no obfuscated parts or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that documents its purpose, includes licensing info, and imports functions/classes from a private submodule. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code fragment.",
