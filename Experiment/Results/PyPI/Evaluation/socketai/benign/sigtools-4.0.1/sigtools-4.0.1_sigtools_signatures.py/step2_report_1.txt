  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a benign, straightforward module that imports functions and classes from an internal module (`sigtools._signatures`) and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- They emphasize the absence of external data handling, user input, network activity, or any suspicious constructs.\n- The code contains licensing information, documentation, and standard import/export patterns.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected in any report.\n- Confidence is high (1) across all reports, and malware/security risk scores are consistently 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if Issues Are Present:\n- The code is a simple module wrapper with no dynamic code, no input handling, and no external data sources.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are evident from this code snippet.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n\n### Score Recommendations:\n- The scores given (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n- Since the code is purely structural and does not process untrusted data or execute code dynamically, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- The risk scores are 0 because there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The code is a standard module setup, typical in Python packages, with no indication of supply chain attack vectors.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports assume the internal module `sigtools._signatures` is safe, which is reasonable given the context.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the analysis is purely based on static code review.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the detailed reasoning in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard module setup with no security concerns.**",
