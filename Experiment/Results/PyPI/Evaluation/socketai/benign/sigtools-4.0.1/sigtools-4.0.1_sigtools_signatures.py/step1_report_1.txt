{
  "purpose": "This code provides high-level functions for manipulating Python function signatures as part of the 'sigtools' library, primarily for use with decorators and signature operations.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from the internal module 'sigtools._signatures'. No external input sources or user data are read directly within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data, nor any that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code based solely on this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing specific signature manipulation functions and classes from an internal module. These functions are then exposed via __all__ for external use. No data flow from untrusted sources is present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is a straightforward module setup with imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module initialization script. It includes licensing information, docstrings describing its purpose, and imports from an internal module. No input handling, data processing, or external calls are present that could introduce security risks. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup for signature manipulation within the 'sigtools' library. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It simply imports and exposes functions from an internal module for external use.",
