  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, benign Python module that imports functions and classes from an internal module (`sigtools._signatures`) and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No external input, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code contains licensing and documentation, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The sources are internal, and there are no external data flows or sinks.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n**Confirmations & Potential Issues:**\n- The code appears straightforward and free of anomalies or security risks.\n- The import and export pattern is typical for Python modules.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external dependencies that could be exploited are evident.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity or intent observed.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — Given the above, the risk is negligible.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- Since the code is just a wrapper module, any security concerns would likely stem from the internal module (`sigtools._signatures`) it imports from. However, based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The consistent high confidence (1) and absence of anomalies support the conclusion that this code is safe.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a benign, standard module setup for the 'sigtools' library, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. It functions as a straightforward interface to internal signature manipulation functions and classes.\n\n**Note:** Always review the internal module (`sigtools._signatures`) for completeness, but based on this snippet, there are no security concerns.",
