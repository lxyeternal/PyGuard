{
  "purpose": "The code provides a module for manipulating function signatures, primarily for use in decorators and signature modifications.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from 'sigtools._signatures'. No user input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions. No code execution or data handling from external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks. The module imports internal components and exposes them via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard library code with normal import/export structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from an internal module 'sigtools._signatures' and defines an explicit list of exported objects. No user input, network communication, or runtime data processing is present. It functions solely as a module aggregator or facade for signature manipulation components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module wrapper for signature manipulation functions and classes. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no suspicious constructs. It appears to be legitimate, standard library code with no security risks.",
