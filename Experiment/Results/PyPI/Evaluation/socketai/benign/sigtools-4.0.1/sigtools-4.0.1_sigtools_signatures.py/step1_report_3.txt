{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes for manipulating Python function signatures, used in decorators and signature computations.",
  "sources": "Imports from the internal module `sigtools._signatures`.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no external input handling or data output to untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly imports and re-exports functions/classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is a straightforward module with documentation and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with license and copyright information, followed by a descriptive docstring. It imports several components from an internal module, then defines an `__all__` list for export. There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no network activity. The import source is an internal module, likely part of the package, and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a typical module setup with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard module for signature manipulation in Python, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It contains no external data handling, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code. The code is safe and aligns with normal library structure.",
