  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a module that provides high-level functions for manipulating Python function signatures within the 'sigtools' library.\n- It includes licensing, documentation, and imports specific functions/classes from an internal module 'sigtools._signatures'.\n- It exposes these via the `__all__` list for external use.\n- There are no data processing, user inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured module setup with no obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n**Consensus:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and has no malicious intent.\n- They note the absence of external data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- The only subtle point might be the import from an internal module (`sigtools._signatures`). If this internal module were compromised or malicious, it could pose a risk, but based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of that.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic is present.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior, code injection, or harmful logic.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear, well-documented, and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk identified in this code snippet.\n\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports and the nature of the code, I agree with the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Note:** The security posture of this module depends on the integrity of the internal module `sigtools._signatures`. If that internal module is compromised, it could introduce risks, but there's no evidence here to suggest that.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, standard module setup for signature manipulation functions within the 'sigtools' library. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with all provided reports and the detailed code review.",
