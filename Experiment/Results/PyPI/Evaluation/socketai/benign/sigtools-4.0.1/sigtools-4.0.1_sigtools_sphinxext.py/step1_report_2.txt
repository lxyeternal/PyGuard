{
  "purpose": "The code extends Sphinx autodoc functionality to use sigtools' signature extraction for better documentation of callables.",
  "sources": "Reads module and attribute names during import and attribute access; utilizes sigtools.specifiers.signature for signature extraction.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is sent over the network or written to files; no execution of untrusted code from external sources.",
  "flows": "fetch_dotted_name reads module names, imports modules; fetch_deep_attr accesses nested attributes; process_signature calls sigtools.specifiers.signature on objects.",
  "anomalies": "Uses __import__ for dynamic module import; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; exception handling for import errors is standard; no obfuscated code features.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily modifies Sphinx's autodoc process to replace function signatures with those generated by sigtools. It dynamically imports modules and retrieves function objects to generate signatures. All imports and attribute accesses appear standard; no suspicious behavior or malicious intent detected. Exception handling is used appropriately for import errors. The code relies on existing libraries and standard Python features, with no unusual patterns or obfuscation. The purpose is purely for documentation enhancement, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as an extension to Sphinx documentation generation, utilizing sigtools to improve signature extraction. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate development purposes.",
