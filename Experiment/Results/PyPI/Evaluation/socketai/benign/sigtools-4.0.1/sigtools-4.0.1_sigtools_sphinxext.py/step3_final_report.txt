  "purpose": "Enhances Sphinx autodoc to use sigtools for extracting function signatures, replacing default signature retrieval with a custom implementation that handles various callable types and modules.",
  "sources": "fetch_dotted_name function that dynamically imports modules based on dotted names; getattr calls to access attributes; sigtools.specifiers.signature for signature extraction.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; dynamic import and attribute access could be exploited if 'name' or module names are controlled by untrusted input.",
  "flows": "fetch_dotted_name retrieves module via __import__, then fetch_deep_attr accesses nested attributes; process_signature calls specifiers.signature on the obtained object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with potentially untrusted input; no validation or sanitization of module names before import; standard exception handling in place.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx extension that dynamically imports modules and retrieves callables for signature processing. It employs typical patterns like __import__ and getattr, with exception handling to avoid crashes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are evident. The main security concern is the dynamic import based on input that could be manipulated if 'name' is untrusted, potentially leading to code execution. However, in typical documentation workflows, module names are static and controlled, minimizing this risk. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves its purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate Sphinx extension for signature extraction using sigtools. No malware or obfuscation detected. The primary security consideration is the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if module names are sourced from untrusted inputs. In standard use cases, this risk is minimal, but caution should be exercised if inputs are untrusted.",
