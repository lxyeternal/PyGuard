{
  "purpose": "This module extends Sphinx's autodoc functionality to extract function signatures using sigtools, facilitating better documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'sphinx.ext', 'sigtools', and internal functions such as fetch_dotted_name and fetch_deep_attr; function parameters and local variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily processes and formats signatures without handling untrusted data for execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The process_signature function fetches and processes object signatures based on their dotted names, then returns formatted signature strings; no data flows into unsafe sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors observed; straightforward implementation with standard exception handling and dynamic attribute access.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known libraries for documentation extension and signature processing. It defines utility functions to dynamically import and access object attributes based on dotted names, then modifies Sphinx autodoc behavior to replace signatures with those generated by sigtools. Exception handling is used appropriately when fetching signatures, and there are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation. The overall structure is clear and consistent with documentation extension practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate extension for Sphinx, enhancing signature extraction for documentation purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are present based on the provided code.",
