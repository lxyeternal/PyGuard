{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to retrieve and manipulate function signatures in Python, including automatic and decorator-based signature inference.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function objects, decorators, and introspection methods (e.g., get_introspectable, signature, autoforwards).",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write or output untrusted data, but relies on introspection functions that could potentially handle untrusted objects. No external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input function objects are analyzed via introspection. Signature data may be modified or wrapped through the signature functions, but there is no flow that leads to data leaks or external data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Usage of introspection and dynamic signature handling appears standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility module for signature introspection and manipulation, involving function attributes, decorators, and signature inference. It relies on internal modules (_signatures, _util, _autoforwards) for core logic. No external data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there apparent sinks that could leak data. The code performs introspection and wraps or upgrades signatures; all operations are consistent with normal utility functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. The use of dynamic attributes and introspection is typical for such libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for function signature analysis and manipulation. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. No evidence of malware or security risks was found. The overall security risk is low.",
