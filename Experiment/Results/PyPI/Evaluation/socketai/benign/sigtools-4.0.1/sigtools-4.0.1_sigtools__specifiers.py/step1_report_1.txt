{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for manipulating and retrieving function signatures, including automated signature discovery and forwarding, primarily for use in function introspection and decorators.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'sigtools' modules (_signatures, _util, _autoforwards); function parameters; attribute access on objects (e.g., '_sigtools__autoforwards_hint').",
  "sinks": "None identified where untrusted data is processed in a potentially harmful way; no network, file, or system modification operations present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (obj, args, kwargs) flow through introspection functions, attribute access, and conditional logic, ultimately returning signature objects; no dangerous data flows or injections are observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal attributes with double underscores (e.g., '_sigtools__forger', '_sigtools__autoforwards_hint') suggests reliance on internal or private APIs, which can be unstable but are not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a signature manipulation utility, using introspection and internal attributes to determine how to generate or modify function signatures. It includes docstrings with usage examples but no external inputs or outputs that could be exploited. No network activity, file access, or system commands are present. The internal attribute usage is typical for internal state management, not malicious. The code’s flow is straightforward, with no suspicious or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a utility for signature handling and introspection, with no evidence of malicious intent or dangerous security risks. It relies on internal APIs and attribute access but does not perform any harmful actions. The overall security risk is minimal.",
