{
  "purpose": "This code provides functionality to retrieve and manipulate function signatures, including automatic and decorator-based signature discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function objects passed as parameters, particularly from the 'obj' parameter and attributes of introspected objects.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present. The code interacts with function signatures internally.",
  "flows": "Input function objects are processed through internal utility functions to generate signatures, with optional modifications based on decorators or hints.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily facilitates introspection and signature manipulation for functions, using internal modules and utilities. It employs standard practices for attribute access, exception handling, and function introspection. No external network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for handling Python function signatures, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module for function signature management. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present.",
