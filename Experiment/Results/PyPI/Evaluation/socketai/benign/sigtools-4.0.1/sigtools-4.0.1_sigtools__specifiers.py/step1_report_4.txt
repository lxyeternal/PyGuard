{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to retrieve and manipulate function signatures, including automatic signature discovery and forwarding signatures for wrapped functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input objects passed to the 'forged_signature' function, particularly inspecting attributes and calling other functions to analyze the object.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calls to functions like '_util.get_introspectable', '_signatures.signature', and '_autoforwards.autoforwards_ast' that process or generate signatures, but these are used for signature manipulation and are not dangerous by themselves.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input object 'obj' through various introspection and signature generation functions, potentially modified by attributes or forwarding mechanisms, then returned as a signature object.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code relies on attribute checks and function calls typical for signature manipulation modules.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'forged_signature' that utilizes introspection to retrieve or generate function signatures, possibly handling decorated or wrapped functions. It makes use of internal attributes and functions from the 'sigtools' package to perform signature analysis. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious network or system operations are present. The only potential concern could be if the imported modules or functions perform malicious operations, but they are part of a signature utility library. Overall, the code appears to perform legitimate signature handling tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for function signature introspection and manipulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It safely performs its intended purpose within a signature processing context.",
