  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes signature manipulation utilities, internal attribute access, and introspection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or dangerous data flows; signature objects are returned.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of internal/private attributes (e.g., '_sigtools__forger') is typical for internal APIs, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard utility for signature handling, with no malicious activity or external effects.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Security risk is low (0.2), malware score is 0, confidence high (0.9).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the retrieval and refinement of function signatures via introspection and internal attributes.\n- No suspicious patterns, no external communication, and no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Same as above, low risk, no malware, high confidence.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on signature retrieval and manipulation, internal attribute access, exception handling.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, no external data flows, or harmful operations.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with previous, low risk, no malware, high confidence.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Describes signature analysis, attribute checks, and internal function calls.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, no obfuscation, no suspicious external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Low risk, no malware, high confidence.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, focusing on signature introspection, internal module usage, and safe handling.\n- No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or external harm.\n- **Scores:** Low risk, no malware, high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected. All reports describe utility functions relying on internal attributes and introspection, which are standard in such libraries.\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns. Use of internal/private attributes is typical for internal API design, not malicious intent.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No external inputs are processed in a way that could lead to injection or code execution. The code is read-only in terms of introspection and signature handling.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** All reports indicate minimal to no security risk, with malware scores at 0 and low overall security risk scores.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard utility code with internal API reliance)\n\nThis code appears to be a legitimate, standard utility for function signature introspection and manipulation, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that internal API usage is kept up-to-date, as reliance on private attributes can lead to instability if the underlying library changes.",
