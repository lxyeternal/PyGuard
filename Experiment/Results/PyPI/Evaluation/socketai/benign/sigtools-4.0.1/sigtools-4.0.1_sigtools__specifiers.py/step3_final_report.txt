{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for retrieving and manipulating function signatures, including handling decorators and internal attributes to refine signatures for introspection purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input via function objects and internal attributes (_sigtools__forger, _sigtools__autoforwards_hint) used for signature introspection and refinement.",
  "sinks": "Returns signature objects; no external data sinks or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Source: function objects and internal attributes -> processing functions -> output signature objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal/private attributes (e.g., '_sigtools__forger') which could be unstable but are typical for internal API reliance; no malicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility for function signature introspection, relying on internal modules and attributes. It performs no network, file, or system modifications. It handles exceptions gracefully and provides comprehensive docstrings. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The reliance on internal attributes is typical for internal API usage but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk ~0.1) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for function signature handling with no signs of malicious activity or security threats. The internal attribute usage is standard for internal APIs and does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score is zero.",
