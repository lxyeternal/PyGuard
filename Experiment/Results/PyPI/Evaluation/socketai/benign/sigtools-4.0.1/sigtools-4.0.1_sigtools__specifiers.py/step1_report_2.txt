{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for manipulating and retrieving function signatures, including automatic signature discovery and forwarding signatures for functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads function objects passed as arguments to 'forged_signature', as well as attributes and hints related to introspection and signature manipulation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not send data over the network, write to files, or execute external commands. It relies on introspection functions and internal modules.",
  "flows": "The input function object is processed through introspection utilities and signature upgrade methods, with flow passing through potential custom forgers or hints, then culminating in returning upgraded signature objects.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code relies on external modules for signature handling, but this is standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'forged_signature' function that retrieves and potentially refines a function's signature via introspection, custom forgers, and hints. It checks for custom '_sigtools__forger' methods and hints for signature manipulation, using internal modules '_signatures' and '_util'. It handles exceptions gracefully and defaults to inspecting the original function when other methods are unavailable. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; the code appears to implement legitimate signature manipulation features. It does not contain any code that would exfiltrate data, connect externally, or perform harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for function signature manipulation and introspection. It uses internal modules to handle signatures and hints, with no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for a utility library.",
