  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines package metadata and dependencies for a Python project related to protocol buffer to dictionary conversion.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, description, version, author, url, install_requires, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static data used solely for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard static setup script using setuptools with no dynamic or malicious components. All fields are hardcoded, and no external data is processed at runtime. The code does not perform any operations beyond defining package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the static, benign content of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
