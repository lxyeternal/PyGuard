  "purpose": "This code integrates Celery task signals with Scout APM for monitoring and performance tracking, and manages configuration copying and disconnection of signal handlers.",
  "sources": "Import statements, get_safe_settings() function, and configuration copying from app.conf",
  "sinks": "ErrorMonitor.send() for reporting errors; potential data leakage through environment info and exception data; setting configuration values",
  "flows": "Error data collected and sent via ErrorMonitor.send(); configuration values copied from app.conf to scout_config; signal callbacks triggered during task lifecycle",
  "anomalies": "Use of get_safe_settings() with exception handling, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no hidden backdoors, no suspicious dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code appears to primarily facilitate monitoring and integration of Celery with Scout APM. It retrieves environment settings securely where possible, handles exception data carefully, and manages signal connections responsibly. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The environment info is fetched cautiously, and error handling avoids leaking sensitive info unnecessarily. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious data flow is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard integration script for monitoring Celery tasks with Scout APM. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It is well-structured, with appropriate error handling and no suspicious activity observed.",
