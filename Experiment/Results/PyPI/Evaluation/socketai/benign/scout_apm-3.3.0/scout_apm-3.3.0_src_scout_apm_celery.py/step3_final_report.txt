  "purpose": "Integration of Celery task signals with Scout APM for monitoring task lifecycle, errors, and performance metrics.",
  "sources": "Headers in task messages, task request attributes (id, parent_id, delivery_info), environment settings via get_safe_settings(), traceback and exception info during failures.",
  "sinks": "Error reporting via ErrorMonitor.send(), tagging of tracked_request with task metadata, environment info potentially sent during error reporting.",
  "flows": "Task signals (before_task_publish -> headers, task_prerun -> tracked_request tags, task_failure -> error reporting, task_postrun -> stop span), environment info fetched during failure, configuration copied from app.conf to scout_config.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no network activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard monitoring hooks for Celery tasks, with safe environment info retrieval and error reporting. It handles exceptions cautiously, avoids obfuscation, and does not include malicious payloads. The signal connections and configuration copying are straightforward. No indicators of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured monitoring integration for Celery with Scout APM, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified based on the static analysis.",
