{
  "purpose": "The code attaches Scout APM monitoring to Huey task execution events to track performance and errors.",
  "sources": "Reads task properties such as task.id, task.__module__, task.__class__.__name__, and exception types during post-execution.",
  "sinks": "Updates Scout's TrackedRequest with task info, error tags, and spans; no direct data leaks or untrusted data usage observed.",
  "flows": "Input data from task object and exception flows into Scout's TrackedRequest methods for tagging and span management.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code hooks into Huey's execution signals and signals handler to monitor task lifecycle, using Scout APM for tracking. It accesses task properties and exceptions to tag request info and manage spans. The logic aligns with standard monitoring practices, with no evident malicious behavior. No data leakage or insecure practices are observed. The code solely interacts with Scout APM's SDK and Huey task objects, with no external or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard monitoring integration with no malicious intent. It securely hooks into task execution events to track performance and errors without exposing sensitive data or performing harmful actions.",
