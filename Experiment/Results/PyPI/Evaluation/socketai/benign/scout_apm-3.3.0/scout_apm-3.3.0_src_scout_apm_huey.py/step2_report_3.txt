  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard monitoring integration between ScoutAPM and Huey.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The code interacts only with ScoutAPM SDK and Huey task objects.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is observed.\n- The functions handle task lifecycle events in a typical, expected manner.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain any bugs or security flaws.\n- It correctly attaches hooks and signals to monitor task execution.\n- No data leaks or untrusted data handling are evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.\n- No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.\n- The exception handling in `scout_on_post_execute` is appropriate.\n- The code's security risk score of 0.1 or 0.2 is consistent with the fact that it handles exceptions and interacts with potentially untrusted task data, but nothing malicious is present.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a score around 0.1-0.2 seems reasonable, reflecting minimal risk from monitoring code.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- No higher risk scores are justified, as the code is purely instrumentation.\n- The only slight concern could be if task data is maliciously crafted, but this is standard for monitoring code, and no actual exploitation is evident.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9-1), matching the thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, due to interaction with task data but no real threat)\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign monitoring integration. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the code's purpose, implementation, and security posture accurately.",
