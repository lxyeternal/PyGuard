{
  "purpose": "The code integrates ScoutAPM performance monitoring with Huey task queue by attaching hooks to monitor task execution lifecycle events.",
  "sources": "Reads from huey exceptions, signals, and task attributes such as task.id, task.__module__, and task.__class__.__name__.",
  "sinks": "Uses TrackedRequest methods to start and stop spans, tag requests, and mark errors based on exceptions.",
  "flows": "On task pre-execution, tags task ID and starts a span; on post-execution, marks request as real or error based on exceptions; on cancellation, stops span.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. Uses standard ScoutAPM hooks.",
  "analysis": "The code hooks into Huey's task lifecycle events to instrument performance tracking via ScoutAPM. It reads task attributes for identification and exception types to mark error states. The code's structure is typical for monitoring integrations, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The use of exception handling is standard and limited to task lifecycle control. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code flow are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign integration script for ScoutAPM with Huey, focused on performance monitoring and error tagging. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
