{
  "purpose": "Integrate ScoutAPM with Huey task queue to track task execution and handle signals.",
  "sources": "Import statements for huey exceptions, signals, scout_apm core, and tracked_request; function parameters such as 'huey', 'task', 'signal', 'exc'.",
  "sinks": "Calls to scout_apm.core.install(), tracked_request methods (tag, start_span, stop_span), which could potentially handle sensitive data if task attributes are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "attach_scout() calls scout_apm.core.install() and attaches handlers; handlers invoke tracked_request methods during task lifecycle events; scout_on_cancelled stops tracking on cancellation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of exception handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily hooks into Huey's task execution lifecycle to record metrics and events via ScoutAPM. It uses standard import patterns, calls to established APIs, and signals. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity is present. The functions handle tracking tasks and exceptions normally, without any hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward integration module for ScoutAPM with Huey, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, using standard practices for monitoring and signal handling.",
