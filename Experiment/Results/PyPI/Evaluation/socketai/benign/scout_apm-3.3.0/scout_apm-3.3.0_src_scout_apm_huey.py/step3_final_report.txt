{
  "purpose": "Integrates Scout APM monitoring hooks into Huey task lifecycle events to track execution, errors, retries, and cancellations.",
  "sources": "Task properties (task.id, task.__module__, task.__class__), exception objects, signal handlers",
  "sinks": "Updates to Scout's TrackedRequest (tagging, starting/stopping spans)",
  "flows": "Task execution triggers pre_execute, post_execute, and cancel signals; data flows from task and exception objects to Scout tracking",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code attaches monitoring hooks to Huey task events, updating Scout's tracking system accordingly. It handles exceptions and cancellations appropriately, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code interacts only with Scout SDK and Huey task objects, following standard instrumentation practices. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The exception handling logic is standard, and no suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard monitoring integration for Scout APM with Huey. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements and poses minimal security risk.",
