  "sources": "req.get_header(), req.params, req.context, req.path, req.method, resp.status",
  "sinks": "tracked_request.tag(), tracked_request.start_span(), tracked_request.stop_span()",
  "flows": "Input headers and request data are processed to set tags and start spans, then spans are stopped and tags set based on response",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code; standard logging and warnings are used; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution present",
  "analysis": "The code implements Falcon middleware for request tracking with Scout APM. It reads request headers (including potential spoofable remote IP and queue times), and uses these to tag requests. It manages request spans for tracing, with proper handling of request and response lifecycles. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors are evident. The only notable aspect is reliance on headers that can be spoofed, which is documented and acceptable within context. No backdoors, malicious network activity, or suspicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Falcon middleware for Scout APM integration. It processes request data for performance monitoring and error tracking without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
