  "purpose": "Middleware for integrating Scout APM with Falcon framework to track requests, spans, and performance metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads request path, headers (x-queue-start, x-request-start, x-forwarded-for, client-ip), request parameters, and request context.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data directly; no dangerous sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input headers and request parameters flow into tracking tags and request context; no data is sent externally or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual code patterns observed. The code performs standard request tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes middleware, processes incoming requests to tag request metadata, and manages spans for performance tracking. It uses standard Falcon and Scout APIs, with checks for proper API setup. It reads headers like 'x-queue-start' and 'x-forwarded-for' for metadata, but these are common practices. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injections are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate monitoring component with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Falcon middleware for Scout APM integration with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It safely manages request tracking and performance spans. There are no anomalies or malicious signals detected.",
