  "purpose": "Utility functions for data manipulation, HTTP request handling, and code introspection.",
  "sources": "None of the functions directly read untrusted input; get_pos_args, unwrap_decorators, kwargs_only analyze function signatures; urllib3_cert_pool_manager uses external CA certificates.",
  "sinks": "No critical sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code appears standard for utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: iteritems for dict iteration, datetime conversion, text encoding, function introspection, decorator unwrapping, enforcement of keyword-only arguments, secure HTTPS connection setup, and gzip compression. All functions perform standard, well-understood operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, code injection, or data theft. Use of certifi for TLS security is appropriate. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for such purposes.",
