  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is utility-focused, with no malicious behavior. The functions are standard, and no suspicious patterns are detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2. The risk score seems slightly high given the benign nature; perhaps 0.1 is more appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No actual vulnerabilities or malicious code are present. The low risk score reflects minimal concern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The functions are standard utilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The risk score is appropriate; no issues here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. The functions are utility helpers.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. This aligns well with the benign analysis.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings—benign utility functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes that while the functions could be misused if combined with malicious inputs, the code itself is standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2. Slightly higher, but still reasonable given the potential for misuse if combined with malicious inputs.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. The code contains no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign very low scores (0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature. Some assign 0.2, which is still low but acknowledges that, in theory, utility functions could be misused if combined with malicious inputs.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — very low, as the code itself is benign, but potential misuse exists if combined with malicious inputs.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a standard set of utility functions with no malicious intent. The risk scores should remain very low, around 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging potential misuse if combined with malicious inputs.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
