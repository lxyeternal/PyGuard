  "purpose": "Utility functions for data conversion, introspection, network setup, compression, and URL handling.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, imported modules (e.g., certifi.where()), class attributes (__wrapped__), environment variables (potentially in certifi), and input data in functions like text() and iteritems().",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via network connections (urllib3), data transformation outputs, or misuse of functions with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input data from function arguments or environment variables flows through conversion and processing functions, with no network or file system operations performed within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'queue'; no suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises benign utility functions with standard library usage. No network requests, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The import of 'queue' is unused but harmless. The security-related functions (e.g., urllib3_cert_pool_manager) set up secure connections properly. Overall, the code is safe, with low potential for misuse outside its intended utility scope.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign utility support code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the analysis. The overall security posture is very low risk, and no modifications are necessary.",
