{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and installing the scout_apm Python package, including optional C extensions.",
  "sources": "File reading of 'README.md' for long description, environment variables ('SCOUT_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS'), package discovery, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data output or external system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'SCOUT_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS' influences whether extension modules are built; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Use of environment variables to control extension building is normal. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup, including reading a README file, detecting system environment to conditionally compile C extensions, and defining package metadata and dependencies. It uses standard practices and does not perform any network operations, code execution, or system modifications beyond package configuration. No suspicious or malicious logic was identified. The environment variable 'SCOUT_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS' is used to disable extensions, which is a common pattern to control optional build features.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, serving standard package configuration purposes without any malicious or maliciously intended code. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or security vulnerabilities.",
