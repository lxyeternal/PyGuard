  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the scout_apm Python agent, including optional C extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; environment variable 'SCOUT_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS'; package discovery via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "Potentially none; no untrusted data sinks such as network calls, database access, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Reading README -> determining whether to compile C extension based on environment and platform -> configuring setup parameters -> installing dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading a README file, detecting environment and platform for optional compilation, configuring package metadata, and defining dependencies. The environment variable 'SCOUT_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS' controls C extension compilation, which is normal behavior. No code indicates data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious modifications. The script strictly handles package setup and configuration, with no network or system compromise mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It simply manages package configuration, optional compilation, and dependencies.",
