{
  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures the Python package 'aliyun-python-sdk-core' for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ attribute from the package, reads the README.rst file for long description, and loads dependencies from the 'requires' list.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call and the reading of files are the main sinks, but they do not handle untrusted data or perform any harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The version import flows from the package into the VERSION variable; file reads flow from disk into variables; finally, setup() uses this data to configure the package.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are detected. The code performs standard setup tasks with no suspicious or unusual behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file for Python packaging. It imports necessary modules, reads version info from the package, reads a README file, and defines installation requirements. All actions are typical for package distribution. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python SDK package. There are no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attacks. It securely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
