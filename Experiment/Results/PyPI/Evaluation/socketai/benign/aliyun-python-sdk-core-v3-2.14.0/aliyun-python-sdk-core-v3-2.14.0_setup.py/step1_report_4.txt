  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the aliyunsdkcore Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os, sys, setuptools; reading README.rst; accessing package version (__import__(PACKAGE).__version__).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external network connections; use of static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reading package version from __import__(PACKAGE).__version__, which is standard and safe.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to be a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup procedures: importing modules, reading a README file, defining dependencies, and invoking setup(). All actions are standard for Python package configuration. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The use of __import__ for version is common in setup scripts and poses no security threat. The code does not execute any untrusted inputs, connect to networks, or modify files beyond package data installation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely defines package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
