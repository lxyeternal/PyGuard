{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup.py script used for packaging the 'aliyun-python-sdk-core' Python SDK. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from the package, reads README.rst file, and static package data files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Imports version from package -> passes static data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: importing modules, reading static files, defining dependencies, and invoking setup(). The version import from the package is standard but assumes package integrity. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved. The code is clear, straightforward, and adheres to common practices. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup.py for packaging a Python SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
