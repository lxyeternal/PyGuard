  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n**1. Code verification:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python SDK.\n- It reads version info from the package, reads a README file, and sets up dependencies and package data.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- No dynamic or untrusted data processing, network activity, or code execution based on external input.\n- The code is typical for Python package distribution.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No technical errors or logical flaws are evident.\n- The only minor point is that importing `__version__` from the package assumes the package is available and correctly defines `__version__`, but this is standard practice.\n- No issues with the code's logic or security.\n\n**3. Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- The confidence score is 1, which is appropriate.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports suggest any risk scores above 0.5; all are zero.\n- Given the code's benign nature, this is justified.\n\n**5. Malware score:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions:**\n- All assessments correctly identify that the code is standard setup code with no malicious intent.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely for packaging.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical, straightforward `setup.py` script for packaging a Python SDK. It performs no malicious actions, no obfuscation, and handles only static data. There are no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe and benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.",
