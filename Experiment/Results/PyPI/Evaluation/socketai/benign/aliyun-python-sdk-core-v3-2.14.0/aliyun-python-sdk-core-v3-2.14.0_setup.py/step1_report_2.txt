{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the Python package 'aliyun-python-sdk-core' for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Data read from 'README.rst' file for long description, package version imported from 'aliyunsdkcore', dependencies listed in 'requires'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or sent over the network; setup configuration uses static metadata.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' → importing version → passing static data to 'setup()' with no dynamic or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious operations observed. The code strictly handles package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard setup procedures: importing modules, reading a README file, defining dependencies, and invoking 'setup()' with static parameters. The 'version' is imported from the package, which is typical but relies on the package's __version__ attribute. No user input, environment variable manipulation, or network activity is present. No obfuscation or malicious code constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
