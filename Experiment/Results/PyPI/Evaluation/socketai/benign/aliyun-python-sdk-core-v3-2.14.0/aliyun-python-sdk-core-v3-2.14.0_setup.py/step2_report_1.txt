  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python SDK.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n- The code reads package version info, reads a README file, and calls setup() with static data.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- The version is imported from the package, which is common practice but could be problematic if the package code is malicious or compromised—though this is standard in setup scripts.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; confirms standard setup.py.\n- **Malware score:** 0, reasonable.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; standard setup.py.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3:\n- Same conclusions as above, consistent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4:\n- Same as above, consistent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5:\n- Same as above, consistent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Are there any signs of malicious activity?** No. The code is a typical setup.py.\n- **Is the version import potentially risky?** Importing the version from the package is standard but could be problematic if the package code is malicious or compromised. However, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- **Is there obfuscation?** No.\n- **Is there any suspicious logic?** No.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is benign and performs typical package setup.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a straightforward, legitimate setup.py script with no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0               |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence presented.",
