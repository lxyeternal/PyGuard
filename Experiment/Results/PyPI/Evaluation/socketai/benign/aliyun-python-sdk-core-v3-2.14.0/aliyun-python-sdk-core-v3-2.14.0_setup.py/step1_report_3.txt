{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and configures the 'aliyun-python-sdk-core' package for distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from the imported package, reading the README file for long description, and specifying dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network operations, file writes with untrusted data, or code execution based on untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "Input data from package version import and README file flows into setup configuration; no external untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The code follows standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and package metadata, reads a README file for long description, specifies dependencies, and calls setup() with all necessary metadata. There are no dynamic or malicious code segments, nor any indication of obfuscation or malware. The code is typical for Python package setup files and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python SDK package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
