  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging an SDK module.\n- It reads version info dynamically via `__import__(PACKAGE).__version__`.\n- It reads the README file for long description.\n- It defines dependencies, package data, and metadata.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- No data leaks, network activity, or code injection points are present.\n- All reports consistently conclude the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n- The code does **not** contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.\n- The version is imported dynamically; if the package is malicious, this could be a concern, but in a standard SDK, this is typical.\n- The package data includes JSON and PEM files, which are standard for SDKs.\n- No external data is sent or received during setup.\n- The scripts read files from the filesystem, which is normal.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n- The `__import__(PACKAGE).__version__` assumes the package exists and has a `__version__` attribute. If the package is malicious or tampered, this could execute malicious code during import. However, this is a common pattern in setup scripts, and no malicious behavior is indicated.\n- The overall security risk is very low, with a reported value of 0.1, which is reasonable.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscation Scores:\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- No suspicious code behavior or obfuscation is present.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- The risk score is very low (around 0.1) because, while the code is benign, importing a package to get its version could, in theory, execute code if the package is malicious. However, in the context of a package setup, this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (standard setup script with minimal risk, no malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a legitimate, standard Python setup script for packaging an SDK module. All evidence points to it being safe and free of malicious behavior. The scores assigned by reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the consensus in the reports and the code's nature.",
