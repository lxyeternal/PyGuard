  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code primarily reads static files (README.rst), imports version info dynamically, and calls `setup()` with package metadata.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection, is present.\n- The code is consistent with typical Python packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues:\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No, all reports agree that the code is benign and standard. No issues are detected or suspected.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or flaws?**  \n  None. The code appears correct and well-structured for its purpose.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Security risk:**  \n  All reports assign very low or zero risk scores (0.1 or 0). Given the code's nature, this seems appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified since no malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No issues justify higher scores; the code is a standard setup script.\n\n### Consistency and reasoning:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code's actual behavior.\n- The assessments correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n**Based on the code and reports, I concur with the assessments.**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or 0, if we want to be very conservative)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code performs standard package setup tasks with no suspicious behavior. The low risk score reflects the minimal security concern. The malware score is zero, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1 (or 0 for utmost certainty) |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate, and no further action is needed.",
