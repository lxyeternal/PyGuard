  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'aliyun-python-sdk-core-v3' package, used to configure the package installation and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ from the 'aliyunsdkcore' package, reads 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is sent over network, written to files, or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "The version is imported from the package; long description is read from a file. No external or untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The script follows standard Python packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports package version dynamically, reads a documentation file, and defines package setup parameters, including dependencies and package data. No code injections, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is standard for Python package setup with proper licensing and metadata. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious network activity is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical and legitimate Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
