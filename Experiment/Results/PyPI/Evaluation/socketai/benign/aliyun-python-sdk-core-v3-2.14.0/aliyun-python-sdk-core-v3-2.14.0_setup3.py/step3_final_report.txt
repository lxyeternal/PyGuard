  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the Alibaba Cloud SDK core module.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, importing version info via __import__(PACKAGE).__version__, static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, data leaks, or code execution beyond standard import.",
  "flows": "Reading README -> importing version -> setup() call with static data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__(PACKAGE).__version__ could execute code if package is malicious, but this is standard practice in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py for a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. It reads static files and metadata, then calls setup(). No network activity or data exfiltration is present. The dynamic import of version info is common but could pose a risk if the package is compromised; however, in legitimate contexts, this is standard. The security risk score of 0.1 reflects minimal inherent risk. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. No further action needed.",
