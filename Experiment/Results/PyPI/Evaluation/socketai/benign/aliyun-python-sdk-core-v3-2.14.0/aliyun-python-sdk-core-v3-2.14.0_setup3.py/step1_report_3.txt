{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package for the Alibaba Cloud SDK, defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version via __import__(PACKAGE).__version__, reads 'README.rst' for long description, and accesses the file system to locate files and directories.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'setup' function from setuptools to install dependencies and package data; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Package version is imported dynamically, and README content is read from disk, but these are standard practices and not insecure flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code primarily performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, involving standard package metadata, dependencies, and data files. It reads version info dynamically and loads a README file, both common in setup scripts. No malicious or suspicious code, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscated segments are present. The code does not interact with untrusted sources or perform any network or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python SDK package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code appears to be legitimate package configuration code without any signs of tampering or malicious intent.",
