  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the aliyun-python-sdk-core-v3 package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), open('README.rst'), __import__(PACKAGE).__version__",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or execution points observed",
  "flows": "Reading version from package, reading README file, setting package data and dependencies",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, reading files, defining package data, and calling setup(). No dynamic code execution, no untrusted input handling, nor suspicious network activity or data leaks. The use of __import__ for version extraction is typical. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns. All activities are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python SDK package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
