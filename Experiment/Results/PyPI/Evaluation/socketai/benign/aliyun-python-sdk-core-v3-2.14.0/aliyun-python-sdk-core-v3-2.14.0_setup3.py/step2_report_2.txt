  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging an SDK module.\n- It reads version info via `__import__(PACKAGE).__version__`, reads a README file, and calls `setup()` with package metadata, dependencies, and package data.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity is evident.\n- All reports agree that the code appears legitimate, with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Package setup for Alibaba Cloud SDK core.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard setup script.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The securityRisk score of 0.1 is slightly above zero, perhaps reflecting minimal inherent risk in package setup scripts (e.g., reading files).  \n**Verdict:** The score seems reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Setup for 'aliyun-python-sdk-core-v3'.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard setup script.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSame reasoning as above. The securityRisk of 0 is justified, as setup scripts are inherently low risk.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Package setup for Alibaba Cloud SDK.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, benign script.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no suspicious code or behavior. The slight securityRisk score is acceptable.  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Setup for 'aliyun-python-sdk-core-v3'.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, benign script.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with others. The securityRisk of zero is appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Setup for Alibaba SDK.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, standard setup code, no suspicious activity.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the minimal inherent risks in package setup scripts, such as reading files or importing modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (acceptable for package setup scripts, minor inherent risks)\n\n**Note:** The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or contain obfuscation/backdoors. The only potential concern is the dynamic import of version info, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The scores are reasonable, and the code is safe and legitimate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
