  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code contains two functions:\n  - `assert_integer_positive(integer, name)`: Validates that `integer` is an `int` and greater than 0; raises `ClientException` with a specific error code if not.\n  - `validate_pattern(prop, prop_name, pattern)`: Uses regex to match `prop` against `pattern`; raises `ClientException` if no match.\n- The code imports standard modules and exception classes, and performs straightforward validation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- **Issue presence:** The code performs basic validation routines; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No bugs or security flaws are apparent. The functions are standard validation utilities.\n\n### Step 2: Review the logic, reasoning, and summary\n- **Logical correctness:** The functions are simple, correct, and standard.\n- **Security considerations:** No data leaks, external calls, or obfuscation.\n- **Malicious intent:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Use of regex:** Standard, with no suspicious patterns or dynamic code execution.\n- **Exception handling:** Properly raises exceptions with specific error codes, typical for SDK validation routines.\n\n### Step 3: Review scores and their reasonableness\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: mostly 0.1 or 0\n  - `confidence`: high (1 or 0.9)\n- These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- The highest risk score is 0.1, which is appropriate because:\n  - The code performs input validation only.\n  - No malicious behavior, no data exfiltration, no code injection.\n  - Exception messages could potentially leak internal details if misused, but this is standard in validation routines.\n- No justification exists for higher risk scores.\n\n### Step 5: Malware score analysis\n- All reports assign malware score 0, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- The reports assume the code is purely validation with no malicious intent. This is accurate.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are unsupported; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard validation routines)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high, based on code review)\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard validation, no security risk)\n- **Notes:** The code is benign, standard validation logic with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a straightforward validation utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; no changes necessary.",
