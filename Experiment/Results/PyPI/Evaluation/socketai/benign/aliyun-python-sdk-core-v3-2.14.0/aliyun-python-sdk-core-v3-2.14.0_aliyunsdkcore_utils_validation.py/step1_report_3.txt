  "purpose": "Validation of input parameters to ensure they meet specific criteria, such as being positive integers or matching a pattern.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'integer', 'prop', and 'prop_name' passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Raising ClientException with error codes and messages upon validation failure.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated through conditional checks; exceptions are raised if validation fails.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of regex for pattern matching is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two validation functions: 'assert_integer_positive' checks if an integer is a positive integer, raising an exception if not; 'validate_pattern' uses regex to verify that a string matches a pattern, raising an exception if it does not. Both functions perform input validation and error reporting via exceptions. No malicious or suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, is evident. The exception handling is standard for validation routines. The code appears to be straightforward validation logic intended for use in larger codebases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard validation logic without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely checks input parameters and raises exceptions on invalid data, serving as input validation helpers. No malware or security risks identified.",
