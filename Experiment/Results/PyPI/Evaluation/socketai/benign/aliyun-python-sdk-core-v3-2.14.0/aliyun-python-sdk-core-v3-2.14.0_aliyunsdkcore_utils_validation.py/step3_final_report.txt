  "purpose": "Validation functions for ensuring positive integers and matching regex patterns, used for input validation in SDK routines.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'integer', 'prop', and 'pattern' which are inputs to validation functions.",
  "sinks": "Exceptions raised with specific error codes; no data leaks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated; exceptions are raised if validation fails; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for validation routines.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two validation functions: one checks if an integer is positive, the other verifies if a string matches a regex pattern. Both functions perform simple, well-understood validation steps and raise exceptions with specific error codes if validation fails. The code imports standard modules and SDK-specific exceptions, with no suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external network activity. The exception messages and error codes are typical for SDK validation routines. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risks (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the simplicity and safety of the code, the overall security risk score can be set to 0, reflecting no significant threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard validation utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports are accurate; the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as 0. The minor security risk score of 0.1 could be lowered to 0 for precision, but overall, the code poses no security threat.",
