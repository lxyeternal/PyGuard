  "purpose": "Validate input parameters such as integers and string patterns, likely for an SDK or API request validation.",
  "sources": "Function arguments `integer`, `prop`, `pattern`, and `prop_name`.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions with error codes and messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and, if invalid, trigger exception raising with specific error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation: it checks if an integer is positive and if a string matches a regex pattern. Both validations raise exceptions with specific error codes and messages if checks fail. The use of exceptions for validation errors is standard; no malicious intent or suspicious data handling is evident. The imported modules are used solely for regex operations and exception handling, both of which are safe and common in such contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements straightforward input validation functions without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger SDK or validation library with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
