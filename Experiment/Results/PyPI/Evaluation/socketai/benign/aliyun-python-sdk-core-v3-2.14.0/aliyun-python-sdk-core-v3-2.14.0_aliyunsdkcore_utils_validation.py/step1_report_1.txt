  "purpose": "Utility functions for validating integer parameters and pattern matching in Alibaba Cloud SDK.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'integer', 'prop', 'prop_name', and 'pattern' provided to validation functions.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions with error codes and messages, which may expose internal error details.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into validation functions, which may raise exceptions if validation fails.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Use of regex for validation is standard; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two validation functions: one for checking if an integer is positive, and another for regex pattern matching. Inputs are validated and exceptions are raised with specific error codes if validation fails. No data is transmitted externally, no code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. Usage of exceptions with error codes is typical for SDK validation routines. No hidden or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard validation logic for SDK parameters without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond standard validation error handling.",
