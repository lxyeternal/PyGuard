  "purpose": "Utility functions for parameter validation, specifically for checking positive integers and pattern matching, in the context of Alibaba Cloud SDK.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'integer' and 'prop' in the functions 'assert_integer_positive' and 'validate_pattern'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raise exceptions with error codes based on validation failures.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated; if invalid, exceptions are raised with specific error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code uses standard regex and type checking, with exception raising for invalid inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two validation functions: 'assert_integer_positive' checks that an integer is positive, raising an exception if not; 'validate_pattern' checks if a string matches a regex pattern, raising an exception otherwise. Both functions use standard validation techniques, raise specific exceptions with error codes, and do not include any malicious code or suspicious behavior. No external data sources, network operations, or hidden backdoors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward validation utility, common in SDKs or input validation routines.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard input validation with exception handling and does not contain any malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It appears to be safe, with no malware or security risks detected.",
