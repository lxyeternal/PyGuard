{
  "purpose": "Provides validation functions for input parameters, specifically checking for positive integers and pattern matching, used in SDK validation processes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'integer', 'prop', and 'pattern' received from external function calls or user input.",
  "targets": "Raises exceptions when validation fails, but does not write to or modify external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated by functions, with pattern matching or integer checks; upon failure, exceptions are raised to signal invalid input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Uses standard regex matching and type validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation checks: ensuring an integer is positive and that a string matches a regex pattern. It imports specific exception classes for error handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; the functions serve as utility validation routines. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors detected. The code adheres to standard validation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation utility with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs input validation safely without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
