  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code snippets: utility functions for validating input parameters (positive integers and regex pattern matching).\n- The functions are standard, straightforward, and commonly used in SDKs or validation routines.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or any malicious activity.\n- Exception handling uses specific error codes, which is typical for SDK validation routines.\n- No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security risks beyond standard validation errors.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is consistent across reports, with no contradictions.\n- The \"malware\" score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The \"securityRisk\" is very low (mostly 0.1 or 0), which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0.\n- The overall risk score is low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or misjudgments:**\n- Since the code is purely validation logic, the risk score could be set even lower (e.g., 0), but a small non-zero value (like 0.1) to account for possible misuses is acceptable.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is standard validation utility functions with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to the potential for misuse in a broader context, but still very low)\n\nThis analysis confirms the code's benign nature and appropriate scoring.",
