  "purpose": "Load JSON data files from a 'data' directory within the package installation directory.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath and aliyunsdkcore.__file__ to determine the data directory path; open() to read JSON files.",
  "sinks": "Reading from the filesystem based on module location; no external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Determines file path from module location -> opens and reads JSON data from that file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of filesystem paths is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the directory of the 'aliyunsdkcore' module, constructs a path to a data file, and loads its JSON content. There are no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It performs a straightforward file read operation based on the module's location. No external network communication or data exfiltration occurs. The code appears to be standard utility code for loading configuration or data files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for loading JSON files from a specific directory within the package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malware signals are present.",
