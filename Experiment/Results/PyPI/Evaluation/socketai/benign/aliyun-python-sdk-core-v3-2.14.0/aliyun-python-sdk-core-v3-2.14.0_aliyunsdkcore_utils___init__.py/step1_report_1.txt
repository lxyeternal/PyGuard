  "purpose": "Load JSON data from a file within the package directory.",
  "sources": "Reading a JSON file located in the 'data' directory relative to the package file.",
  "sinks": "json.loads() parsing file content, which is safe if the file contents are trusted.",
  "flows": "File is read from disk, then its content is parsed as JSON, with no further data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. The code simply loads static data.",
  "analysis": "The function constructs a path to a JSON file within the package's data directory and reads it into memory. It uses standard library functions and the 'aliyunsdkcore' package path to determine location. There are no dynamic inputs from external sources, user input, or environment variables involved. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and the code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or insecure data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward, safe operation of loading a static JSON file from the package directory. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
