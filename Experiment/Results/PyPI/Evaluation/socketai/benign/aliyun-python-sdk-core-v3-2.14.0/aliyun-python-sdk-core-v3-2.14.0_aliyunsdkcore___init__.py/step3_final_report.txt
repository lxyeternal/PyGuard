{
  "purpose": "Suppress logs from the 'aliyunsdkcore' SDK to prevent clutter or unwanted output.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines a version string, imports logging, and creates a NullHandler class.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or untrusted data handling; the code only sets up logging behavior.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code simply attaches a handler to a logger.",
  "anomalies": "Use of NullHandler is a common pattern; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard logging suppression pattern via a custom NullHandler class. It is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The purpose is benign: controlling SDK logging output. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's intent and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for suppressing SDK logs with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports accurately assess the code as harmless, and the scoring is appropriate.",
