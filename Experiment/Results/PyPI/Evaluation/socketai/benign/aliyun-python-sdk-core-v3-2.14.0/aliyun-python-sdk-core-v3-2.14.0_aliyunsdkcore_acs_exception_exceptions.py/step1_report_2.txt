  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SDK error handling in Alibaba Cloud SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'error_type' from 'aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "Input data for exceptions (error codes, messages, HTTP status, request ID) assigned to class attributes, used in string representations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, ClientException and ServerException, inheriting from Exception. They initialize with parameters such as error codes, messages, HTTP status, and request IDs, and provide methods to set and get these attributes. The import statement is for error type constants. No external data sources, untrusted input processing, or risky operations are present. The code appears to be straightforward exception handling without malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for SDK error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security concerns. It is a benign, well-structured error handling module.",
