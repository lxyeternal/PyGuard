  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes (`ClientException` and `ServerException`) for an SDK, importing `error_type` from `aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception`. It only defines exception classes with methods to set and get error details, and string representations.  \n   **No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.** The code appears standard and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is typical SDK exception handling code, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks. The analysis correctly notes the absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.  \n   **No errors or flaws are apparent in the reports' reasoning.**\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.  \n   **Scores seem reasonable and consistent.**\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely for exception handling with no malicious or security-compromising behavior, risk scores should remain at 0.5 or below. The reports correctly assign 0, which is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious code.  \n   **This is appropriate.**\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they simply analyze the code's structure and behavior, concluding it's standard SDK exception handling code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores align with the analysis, which finds no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct; code is clear and standard)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct; no security risks identified)\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, benign SDK exception module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Therefore, my recommended scores are:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Summary**: The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.",
