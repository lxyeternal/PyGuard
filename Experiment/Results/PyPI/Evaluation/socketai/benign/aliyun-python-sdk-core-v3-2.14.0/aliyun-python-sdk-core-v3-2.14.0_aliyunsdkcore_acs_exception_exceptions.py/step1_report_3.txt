{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling client and server errors within an SDK, specifically related to Alibaba Cloud's SDK core.",
  "sources": "Imports error_type from aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external communications",
  "flows": "None; the code only initializes and manages exception objects with provided parameters",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior present",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, ClientException and ServerException, which extend Python's Exception class. These classes store error codes, messages, and other request-related info, but do not perform any input validation, network operations, or data processing that could lead to security issues. The error_type is imported but not manipulated or leaked in a suspicious way. The constructors and methods are standard, with no code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The code appears to be a typical implementation for error handling within an SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve as a structured way to handle errors in an SDK environment, with no suspicious or malicious actions.",
