  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling client and server errors within an SDK related to Alibaba Cloud services.",
  "sources": "Imports error_type from aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in a sensitive context or output",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard exception handling and class definitions without unusual patterns or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code provides two custom exception classes, ClientException and ServerException, each initialized with error details like code, message, and HTTP status (for ServerException). They set internal attributes and define __str__ methods for string representation. There are no inputs from external sources, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no network or file operations. The use of imported error_type is static and safe. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for an SDK, with no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module intended for error reporting.",
