{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling client and server errors in an SDK, specifically for Alibaba Cloud SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'error_type' from 'aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception'",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard exception class structure, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, ClientException and ServerException, inheriting from Python's Exception. They initialize with error codes and messages, and optionally HTTP status and request ID for ServerException. Methods for setting and retrieving error details are provided. The import from 'aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception' appears to be standard, used to categorize error types. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure is typical for SDK exception handling, with no evidence of obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for an SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as part of error handling infrastructure without any malicious behavior or malicious data handling.",
