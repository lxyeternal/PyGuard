  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of individual reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as defining two custom exception classes (`ClientException` and `ServerException`) for an SDK, importing `error_type` from `aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception`.\n- They note that the code is straightforward, with no data leaks, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- No external data flows, network operations, or untrusted input processing are present.\n- The code structure is standard for SDK error handling.\n\n**Confirming the presence of issues:**\n- The code is well-structured, and no malicious or suspicious elements are evident.\n- The import statement and class implementations are typical and safe.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the code is benign and serve as error handling infrastructure.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The `confidence` scores are all 1, which is justified given the clear and standard implementation.\n\n**Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the scores for malware, obfuscated code, or security risk exceed 0.5, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n- No justification is needed for higher scores.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard exception classes.\n- No hidden or malicious logic is implied or suspected.\n\n**Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for an SDK, with no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, and no security vulnerabilities. The import and class design are typical, and the reports correctly identify this.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain risk for this code is negligible. It is a benign, well-structured error handling module with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always monitor for future updates or modifications, but based on the current code and reports, no security concerns are warranted.",
