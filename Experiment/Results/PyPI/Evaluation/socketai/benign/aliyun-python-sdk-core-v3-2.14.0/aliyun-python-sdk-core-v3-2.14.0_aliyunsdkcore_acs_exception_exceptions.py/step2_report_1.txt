  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   The code provided is a standard implementation of custom exception classes (`ClientException` and `ServerException`) for an SDK, importing `error_type` from `aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception`. It defines constructors, setters, getters, and string representations, with no suspicious or malicious code.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   - The code appears benign.  \n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows are present.  \n   - No external data is processed in a risky way.  \n   - No network, file, or system commands are executed.  \n   - The import seems to be a standard categorization for error types.\n\n3. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:  \n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.  \n   - The implementation aligns with typical SDK exception handling patterns.\n\n4. **Scores Review**:  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the clear, standard implementation.\n\n5. **Risk Justification**:  \n   - Since the code is purely for error handling, with no malicious behavior, the risk score of 0 is justified.  \n   - No higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n6. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores**:  \n   - Malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n7. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:  \n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not process untrusted input or perform risky operations.\n\n8. **Consistency and Final Assessment**:  \n   - All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.  \n   - The code is a typical, well-structured SDK exception module with no security issues.\n\n**My own estimate after review**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is benign, standard, and free of security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
