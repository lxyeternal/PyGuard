{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes (ClientException and ServerException) for an SDK, handling error codes, messages, and related info.",
  "sources": "Error code and message parameters during exception instantiation, import of error_type from aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows, network calls, or external data processing present",
  "flows": "Input parameters (code, msg, http_status, request_id) flow into exception object attributes; no external sinks involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with standard patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for an SDK, importing a predefined error_type. It initializes error details, provides setters and getters, and formats string representations. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any risky operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. The structure and logic are typical and safe, with no vulnerabilities or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK exception module with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores and assessments across reports are accurate and consistent. No further action is necessary.",
