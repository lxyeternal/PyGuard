  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports describe the same code: two custom exception classes (ClientException and ServerException) for an SDK, importing 'error_type' from 'aliyunsdkcore.acs_exception', with no data flows to external systems, no suspicious code, and standard exception handling patterns.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident in the code.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning.**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is standard, benign, and lacks malicious intent. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue.**  \nAll reports assign:  \n- Confidence: 1 (full confidence)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0\n\nThese scores seem appropriate given the code's nature. The malware score of 0 is justified, as there's no malicious activity. The security risk score of 0 is also appropriate.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5.**  \nSince all reports assign 0 to malware and security risk, no justification is needed for higher scores. The code is clearly benign.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions.**  \nAll reports are cautious and based on the code's actual content, not assumptions. They correctly identify that the code is standard exception handling, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure scores are consistent with the report.**  \nScores are consistent with the findings. No discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is straightforward, defining custom exceptions for an SDK.  \n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.  \n- No external data leaks, network activity, or code injection observed.  \n- Import statements are standard and used appropriately.  \n- The exception classes only store and format error information.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall security posture of this code is benign. It is a typical, well-structured exception handling module with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The detailed analysis supports these assessments.",
