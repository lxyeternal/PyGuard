  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard SDK request model supporting RPC, ROA, and common styles. Sources are parameters, headers, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** URL generation, signing, headers, content—normal SDK operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Uses external cryptographic modules for signing, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment correctly identifies this as a legitimate SDK component with no malicious intent. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scoring are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on request construction and signing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** URL signing, headers, parameters—standard operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Uses standard cryptographic functions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states this is a standard SDK with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores align with the analysis; malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on constructing and signing API requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** URL signing, headers, request URL—normal SDK behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or secrets detected. Uses external signing modules.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly concludes no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports—request construction and signing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** URL generation, headers, signing—standard SDK operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. External signing functions are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, constructing and signing requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** URL signing, headers, content—normal SDK functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. No secrets or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment correctly states the code is a typical SDK component with minimal security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, correctly indicating the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation but generally low, reflecting the code's standard nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard SDK implementation for Alibaba Cloud API requests.\n- It manages parameters, headers, and signing processes using external, well-known cryptographic modules.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The request signing and URL generation follow typical patterns, with no suspicious data flows or behaviors.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (standard SDK risk level, minimal operational security concerns)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
