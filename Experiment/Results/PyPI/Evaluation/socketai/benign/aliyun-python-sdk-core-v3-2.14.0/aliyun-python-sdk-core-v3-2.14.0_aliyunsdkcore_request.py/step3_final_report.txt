{
  "purpose": "This code provides a framework for constructing, signing, and managing API requests to Alibaba Cloud services, supporting RPC, ROA, and common request styles.",
  "sources": "Parameters, headers, content, URI pattern, path parameters, query parameters, and external signing modules.",
  "sinks": "Generated request URLs, signed headers, and request content; no untrusted data directly leads to data leaks or system effects within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and headers flow into URL signing, header setting, and request URL generation via external cryptographic functions, with no suspicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code structure is standard for SDK implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate SDK component for Alibaba Cloud, utilizing external cryptographic modules for signing. It manages request parameters, headers, and URL construction in a typical manner. No malicious, backdoor, or obfuscated code is evident. The data flow is straightforward, and the external modules are presumed trustworthy. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK request framework with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
