  "purpose": "Utility functions for ensuring data is in bytes or string format, with compatibility support for Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version checks, and type checks within functions.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no data being sent to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (s) is checked and converted within ensure_bytes and ensure_string functions; no external data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses legacy Python 2 compatibility, which is common but not inherently malicious. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No risky operations such as code injection, data leakage, or insecure handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility functions for handling string and byte data across Python 2 and 3, importing appropriate base64 functions based on Python version. It performs type checks and converts data accordingly, raising errors on unexpected types. No external data input or network operations are present. The functions are standard utility implementations with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility utility code for string/byte handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.",
