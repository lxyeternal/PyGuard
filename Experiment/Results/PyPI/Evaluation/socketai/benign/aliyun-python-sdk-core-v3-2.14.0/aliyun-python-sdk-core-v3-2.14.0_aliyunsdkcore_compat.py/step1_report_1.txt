  "purpose": "Utility functions for ensuring byte and string conversions compatible with Python 2 and 3, along with base64 encoding/decoding.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, aliyunsdkcore.vendored.six, and base64 module functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the base64 encoding/decoding functions (b64_encode_bytes, b64_decode_bytes) could be misused if provided with malicious input data, but in this context, they are standard library functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings, bytes, bytearrays) processed through ensure_bytes or ensure_string, then potentially encoded/decoded via base64 functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code contains Python 2/3 compatibility logic, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing compatibility functions for string/byte conversions across Python versions and base64 encoding/decoding. It uses standard library functions appropriately. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard utility functions for string and byte handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
