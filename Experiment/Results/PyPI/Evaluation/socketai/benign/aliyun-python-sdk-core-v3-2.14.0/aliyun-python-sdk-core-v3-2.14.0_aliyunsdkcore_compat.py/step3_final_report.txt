{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility functions for string/byte conversions and base64 encoding/decoding across Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, six, and base64 modules; reads no external data or input.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard library functions; no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Defines conversion functions that process input data types; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for handling string and byte conversions with Python version compatibility. It employs standard library functions and performs type checks and conversions safely. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or external data interactions are present. The functions are well-structured, with appropriate error handling, and serve purely as helpers for data type consistency across Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for compatibility purposes, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as standard utility code with no suspicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
