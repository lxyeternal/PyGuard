{
  "purpose": "This code implements a standard Alibaba Cloud SDK client for managing credentials, signing requests, handling retries, and network communication. It is designed for legitimate interactions with Alibaba Cloud services.",
  "sources": "Credentials passed as parameters, request parameters, environment variables, configuration files, network endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Alibaba Cloud endpoints, logging outputs, JSON/XML request bodies.",
  "flows": "Credentials and request data flow into signing and request construction, then into network transmission, and response handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard SDK patterns, with proper handling of credentials, request signing, retries, and error management. It uses legitimate libraries and external dependencies without signs of tampering. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The network interactions are with official Alibaba Cloud endpoints. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure, indicating a benign, well-structured SDK client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Alibaba Cloud SDK client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the risk score appropriately reflects minimal security concern.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
