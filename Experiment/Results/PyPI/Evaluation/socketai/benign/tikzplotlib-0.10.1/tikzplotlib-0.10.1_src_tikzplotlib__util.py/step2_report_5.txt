  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides utility functions for matplotlib: checking for legends, retrieving legend text, and transforming coordinates.\n- Uses standard matplotlib and numpy functions.\n- No external I/O, network calls, or execution of untrusted code.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code appears straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for matplotlib.\n- Security analysis: No external calls, no data leaks, no malicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for matplotlib, legend retrieval, coordinate transformation.\n- Notes: Potential exploitation if input data is malicious, but no external I/O.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, perhaps due to the transformation functions processing untrusted data)\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Verdict:** The slight security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable, as coordinate transformations could be exploited with malicious data, but no external I/O occurs. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar functions, focusing on reading legend info and transforming coordinates.\n- No suspicious activity or code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar utility functions.\n- Notes: No external I/O, no malicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Utility functions, similar to others.\n- No malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (due to coordinate transformations, but no external I/O)\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with some reports assigning 0.1, reflecting minimal concern about the processing of potentially untrusted data during coordinate transformations. This is reasonable, given that transformations could be exploited if input data is malicious, but no external I/O or code execution occurs.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which matches the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign set of utility functions for matplotlib plotting.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The small security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is justified, as coordinate transformations could be misused if fed malicious data, but this does not constitute a security breach.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk due to potential misuse of coordinate data, but no real security threat)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code is safe, with negligible security risk.",
