{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for interacting with matplotlib plots, such as checking for legends, retrieving legend text, and transforming coordinates to data space.",
  "sources": "The code reads attributes from matplotlib axes and objects, including get_legend(), get_label(), and get_transform(). It also uses numpy arrays as input data for transformations.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects. No system or network calls, or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads plot object attributes (sources), performs coordinate transformations using numpy and matplotlib functions (potentially processing untrusted input data), but no data flows to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses matplotlib.transforms.composite_transform_factory, which is a complex transformation function. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code constructs are present. No obfuscation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to check for plot legends, retrieve legend labels, and transform coordinates between display and data coordinate systems. It relies on matplotlib's API and numpy for data manipulation. The functions do not execute any external or untrusted code, nor do they process external input sources such as user input or network data. The use of transformations appears standard, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation. There are no backdoors, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms present. The functions are utility-based and intended for plot manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of matplotlib utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply interacts with plotting objects and performs coordinate transformations. No malicious intent, data leakage, or sabotage is evident.",
