  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling matplotlib plot elements and coordinate transformations",
  "sources": "Inputs include matplotlib axes objects, line objects, and coordinate data (xdata, ydata)",
  "sinks": "Transform functions potentially process data for plotting but do not write to external systems or leak data",
  "flows": "Coordinate data flows through transformation functions, from input to transformed output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic; the code is straightforward and relies on matplotlib and numpy libraries",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for plotting: checking for legends, retrieving legend labels, and transforming coordinates. It uses numpy for array manipulations and matplotlib's transformation utilities to convert coordinate spaces. No external network access, data leakage, or malicious code execution mechanisms are present. The use of third-party libraries is appropriate and safe. No anomalies such as backdoors, hidden code, or suspicious behavior are observed. The functions perform typical plotting tasks with clear, safe logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for matplotlib plotting. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, and poses no significant security risks.",
