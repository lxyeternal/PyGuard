  "purpose": "Utility functions for interacting with matplotlib plot objects, specifically for legend retrieval and coordinate transformations.",
  "sources": "Reading from matplotlib axes and legend objects, and input data for coordinate transformations.",
  "sinks": "Potential transformation computations could be exploited if malicious input data is provided, but no external network or file I/O is involved.",
  "flows": "Input data (xdata, ydata) flows through transformation functions; legend labels and handle properties are read and processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for matplotlib objects: 'has_legend' checks for existing legends; 'get_legend_text' retrieves label text for legend handles; 'transform_to_data_coordinates' converts coordinate spaces using matplotlib's transformation pipeline. All operations involve standard matplotlib object properties and numpy array manipulations. No external I/O, network calls, or potentially malicious logic detected. The functions are safe and intended for plotting data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of benign utility functions for matplotlib plots with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles data and plot object properties securely and transparently.",
