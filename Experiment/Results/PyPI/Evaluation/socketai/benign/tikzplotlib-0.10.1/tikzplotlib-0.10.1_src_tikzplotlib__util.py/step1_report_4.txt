  "purpose": "Utility functions for interacting with matplotlib plot objects, including legend handling and coordinate transformation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'axes', 'obj', 'xdata', 'ydata' which are inputs to the functions.",
  "sinks": "Transformations and data retrievals that could potentially process untrusted data, particularly within 'transform_to_data_coordinates'.",
  "flows": "Input data or objects are processed within functions, especially 'transform_to_data_coordinates' which transforms coordinate data through matplotlib's transform chain.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Functions rely on standard matplotlib and numpy methods.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions for matplotlib plot objects: 'has_legend' checks for legend existence; 'get_legend_text' retrieves label text associated with plot handles; 'transform_to_data_coordinates' converts coordinate data from various coordinate systems to data coordinates using matplotlib transforms. All functions utilize standard matplotlib API calls and numpy for array handling. No obfuscated language features or suspicious code patterns are present. No external network calls, data leakage, or system modification code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, standard utility functions for matplotlib visualization handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified. It functions purely within visualization context.",
