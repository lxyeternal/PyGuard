{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for working with matplotlib axes and legends, specifically for extracting legend text and transforming coordinates to data space.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from matplotlib axes objects and their associated legend handles and texts.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that process untrusted data or could cause data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves legend information and transforms coordinate data based on matplotlib's transformation methods; no external data flows or untrusted input processing are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard plotting utility functions without any hidden or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform read-only operations on matplotlib axes objects and legend handles, extracting labels and texts, and transforming coordinate data using matplotlib's transformation methods. The code relies entirely on matplotlib's internal functions and data structures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no network operations, no file access, and no handling of untrusted input that could be exploited. The transformations and legend handling are standard procedures in plotting workflows. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for handling matplotlib legends and coordinate transformations. It contains no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated elements. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
