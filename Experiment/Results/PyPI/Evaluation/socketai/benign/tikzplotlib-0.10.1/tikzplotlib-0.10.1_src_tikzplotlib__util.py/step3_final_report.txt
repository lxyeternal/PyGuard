  "purpose": "Utility functions for matplotlib plots: checking for legends, retrieving legend text, and transforming coordinates to data space.",
  "sources": "Reads properties from matplotlib axes and plot objects, such as get_legend(), get_label(), and transformation matrices.",
  "sinks": "None; functions perform read-only operations without external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads from matplotlib objects; coordinate transformation involves internal matrix operations, no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard API usage, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard matplotlib and numpy functions to perform utility operations related to plot legends and coordinate transformations. It does not execute untrusted code, perform I/O, or contain malicious constructs. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports accounts for potential misuse if untrusted data is fed into coordinate transformations, but this is typical for plotting utilities and not indicative of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for matplotlib plotting. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The slight security risk score of 0.1 is justified due to the potential for misuse with untrusted data, but does not constitute a security concern in normal usage.",
