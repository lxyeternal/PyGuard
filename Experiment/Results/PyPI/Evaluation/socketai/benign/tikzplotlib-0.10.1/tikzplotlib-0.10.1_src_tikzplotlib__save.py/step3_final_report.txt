  "purpose": "This code converts matplotlib figures into LaTeX/TikZ code for high-quality figure export, involving code generation and file writing.",
  "sources": "Reads data from matplotlib figure and axes objects, including child artists and properties.",
  "sinks": "Generates LaTeX/TikZ code as strings, writes output to files, and optionally prints messages.",
  "flows": "Data flows from matplotlib objects through code generation functions into LaTeX strings, then to file or string output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity. Potential LaTeX injection if user inputs are malicious, but not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for exporting matplotlib figures to LaTeX/TikZ. It uses safe Python and matplotlib APIs, with no obfuscation or malicious logic. File I/O is straightforward, and no external network calls are present. The only security concern is LaTeX code injection if user inputs are malicious, which is a common and manageable risk in code that generates LaTeX strings. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and well-structured. The security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting the LaTeX injection potential but not actual malicious behavior. Overall, the code is a legitimate, safe utility for figure export with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured matplotlib to LaTeX/TikZ exporter. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The only minor security concern relates to LaTeX code injection potential if user inputs are malicious, but this does not constitute malware. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate and justified.",
