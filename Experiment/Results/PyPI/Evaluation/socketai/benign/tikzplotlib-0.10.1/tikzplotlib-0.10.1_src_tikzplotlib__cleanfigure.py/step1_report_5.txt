{
  "purpose": "The code is a collection of functions designed to clean and simplify matplotlib figures for TikZ export, handling both 2D and 3D plots, including lines and collections.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from matplotlib figure, axes, line, collection, and collection data objects; it retrieves data points, limits, scales, and projection matrices.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include setting data on line and collection objects, which could be exploited if malicious data is injected; however, the code primarily manipulates data internally and does not perform unsafe operations like executing external code or network activities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from figure/axes/line/collection objects into internal data processing functions, where data is pruned, simplified, and then written back to these objects, with no external network or file I/O observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous 'NotImplementedError' placeholders, warnings about unsupported features, and internal warnings; however, none indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic is present. The extensive mathematical and graphical data processing appears standard for figure manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs geometric and data processing on matplotlib plot objects, including data extraction, pruning outside visual bounds, simplifying line paths, and adjusting data precision. No network operations, system commands, or external code execution is present. The functions are consistent with figure preprocessing for export. The code does include warnings and placeholders indicating incomplete support for certain features but these are benign and related to functionality gaps, not malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate figure processing utility for matplotlib intended for TikZ export, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It manipulates plotting data internally without external communication or harmful operations. The overall security risk is minimal.",
