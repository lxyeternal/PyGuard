  "purpose": "This code provides functions to clean and simplify matplotlib figures, especially for exporting to TikZ. It handles 2D and 3D plots, including lines, collections, and axes transformations, aiming to reduce data points for efficient figure export.",
  "sources": "Data is read from matplotlib line objects (get_xdata, get_ydata, get_data_3d), collection objects (get_offsets, _offsets3d), axis limits (get_xlim, get_ylim, get_zlim), and figure properties (get_figwidth, get_figheight). It also reads plot styles and handle attributes (like get_linestyle, get_linewidth).",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous operations include data modifications such as replacing data points with NaNs, deleting data points, and updating line/collection data (set_data, set_xdata, set_ydata, set_data_3d, set_offsets). These could be used maliciously to alter plot data or mask data points.",
  "flows": "Data is retrieved from plot objects -> processed/filtered (e.g., removing outside points, simplifying paths) -> possibly replaced or NaN-inserted -> data is set back into plot objects via set_data / set_offsets functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains warnings for unsupported features (LineCollection, Poly3DCollection, BarContainer), but these are benign. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network actions are present. Functions are for figure manipulation; no obfuscated code is evident. Some functions raise NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete features but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive utility for cleaning and simplifying matplotlib figures, especially for export purposes. It reads data from plot objects, applies geometric transformations, pruning outside points, simplifying paths, and reducing data resolution. The functions modify plot data internally but do not include any network, system, or privacy-violating operations. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated language features are used. Warnings for unsupported features suggest incomplete implementation but not malicious intent. There are no signs of malware or sabotage. The overall purpose appears benign and technical, focused on figure data optimization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utilities for figure data simplification and cleaning, with no malicious behavior detected. It manipulates plot data for export purposes but does not perform any harmful actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity. The presence of warnings for unimplemented features indicates incomplete development but not malicious intent.",
