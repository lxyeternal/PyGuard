{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for cleaning, simplifying, and processing matplotlib figures and plots, particularly aimed at reducing data points for TikZ export and visualizing 3D plots.",
  "sources": "Input data from matplotlib line objects, collection objects, axes limits, projection matrices, and user parameters such as target resolution and scale precision.",
  "sinks": "Modifies matplotlib figure, axes, line, and collection objects by updating data points, replacing data with NaNs, or deleting data points.",
  "flows": "Data is read from plot objects, processed through various data manipulation functions, and then used to update the plot objects with simplified or NaN-filled data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains warnings about unimplemented features (e.g., cleaning containers), placeholder functions raising NotImplementedError, and no explicit data leak or external communication. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external calls are present. The functions perform geometric and data manipulation within the plotting context, with no signs of hidden backdoors, network activity, or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a comprehensive suite for plot data processing and visualization optimization, with functions for extracting, modifying, simplifying, and bounding plot data. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. Some functions are placeholders or warnings for unsupported features, which do not imply malicious intent. The code relies entirely on standard matplotlib and numpy functions, with no external or suspicious dependencies or operations. The primary focus is on visualization data manipulation, not on any covert or harmful activities.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign utility for processing matplotlib plots, mainly for reducing data points and preparing figures for export. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The presence of unimplemented functions and warnings indicates incomplete features but not malicious intent.",
