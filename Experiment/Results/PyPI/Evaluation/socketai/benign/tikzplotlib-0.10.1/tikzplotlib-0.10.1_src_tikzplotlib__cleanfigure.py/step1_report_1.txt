{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for cleaning and simplifying matplotlib figures, especially for export to TikZ, including recursive traversal of plot elements, data pruning, path simplification, and projection handling for 3D plots.",
  "sources": "Reads input from matplotlib figure, axes, lines, collections, and user-supplied parameters like figure handle, resolution, and scale.",
  "sinks": "Modifies matplotlib objects directly (e.g., set_data, set_offsets). No external data transmission or system commands are observed.",
  "flows": "Sources (input parameters, figure/axes/lines) pass through internal functions to manipulate or prune data; modifications are written back directly to plot objects. No external network, file, or system command flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code appears standard for plot cleaning and data reduction, with warnings for unsupported features. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation for cleaning matplotlib figures, including recursive traversal of plot elements, data pruning outside visual bounds, line simplification algorithms, and 3D projection calculations. Functions are well-documented, primarily manipulating plot data in-memory. No external network calls, file access, or system commands are invoked. Warnings are issued for features not yet supported, but these are benign. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of figure optimization without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for matplotlib figure processing, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or data exfiltration. It operates entirely within the matplotlib framework and does not perform any harmful actions.",
