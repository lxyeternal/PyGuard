{
  "purpose": "This code maps matplotlib marker styles to PGFPlots styles, facilitating style translation for plotting.",
  "sources": "Dictionary lookups for marker style mappings, input parameters 'mpl_marker' and 'is_filled', and the 'data' dictionary passed into the function.",
  "sinks": "The function modifies the 'data' dictionary by adding 'plotmarks' to 'tikz libs' and returns style identifiers; no external sinks or data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'mpl_marker' and 'is_filled' are used to lookup and modify style mappings; the 'data' dict is updated if needed; the function returns updated data and style info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. Exception handling for missing keys is standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static dictionary lookups to translate matplotlib markers to PGFPlots styles, with conditional modifications based on 'is_filled'. It handles missing keys gracefully via try-except blocks. No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The dictionaries are static, and the function's purpose is purely style translation, making it benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for style mapping with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
