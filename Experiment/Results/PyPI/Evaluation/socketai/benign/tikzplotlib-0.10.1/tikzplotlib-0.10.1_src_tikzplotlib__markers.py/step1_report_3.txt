{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions and mappings to translate matplotlib marker styles into PGFPlots styles for plotting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from predefined dictionaries (_MP_MARKER2PGF_MARKER, _MP_MARKER2PLOTMARKS) and input parameters (mpl_marker, is_filled). It also reads from the 'data' dictionary for 'tikz libs' set operations.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the return statement that outputs modified 'data' and marker style information; no external data or system effects occur.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through lookups in the dictionaries, with potential modifications based on conditions, and is returned. No untrusted input handling or external system interaction is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with dictionary lookups and conditionals. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes two dictionaries mapping matplotlib markers to PGFPlots equivalents. The function _mpl_marker2pgfp_marker attempts to convert a matplotlib marker to PGFPlots style, adding 'plotmarks' to 'tikz libs' if necessary. It handles special cases like filled markers and different marker styles. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or security-sensitive operations. The logic is contained and predictable, with no network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward translation utility for plotting markers, with no malicious or security concerns. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
