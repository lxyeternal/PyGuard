{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and mappings to translate matplotlib marker styles to PGFPlots styles for plotting purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; all data sources are predefined dictionaries and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The function manipulates the 'data' dictionary and marker style variables; no sinks related to network, file, or system actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input marker style and 'is_filled' flag are used to determine the output marker style; data dictionary may be modified by adding 'plotmarks' library.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code straightforwardly maps marker styles with conditional adjustments. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two dictionaries for marker mappings and a function to convert matplotlib markers to PGFPlots equivalents. The function attempts to map a given marker to the PGF style, first via a default dictionary, then via a secondary mapping, adding a library dependency if needed. The logic is clear, and no suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for marker style translation without malicious behavior. It performs mapping operations based on predefined dictionaries and simple conditional logic. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
