  "purpose": "Define mappings and translation functions for matplotlib markers to PGFPlots styles.",
  "sources": "Constants _MP_MARKER2PGF_MARKER, _MP_MARKER2PLOTMARKS, and function _mpl_marker2pgfp_marker.",
  "sinks": "None; no data outputs or external data reads beyond variable lookups.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink data flow or external command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes static mappings between matplotlib markers and PGFPlots equivalents. The function performs dictionary lookups, with handling for missing keys, and updates a 'tikz libs' set within the 'data' object. No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The logic is straightforward, involving lookups and conditional modifications based on parameters. No malicious intent or hidden backdoors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely utility mapping logic intended for graphical style translation. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a safe, purpose-specific implementation.",
