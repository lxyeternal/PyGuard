  "purpose": "Define functions and mappings to translate matplotlib marker styles to PGFPlots styles for plotting purposes.",
  "sources": "Mapping dictionaries (_MP_MARKER2PGF_MARKER, _MP_MARKER2PLOTMARKS), function _mpl_marker2pgfp_marker that reads the 'mpl_marker' parameter, and 'data' input for TikZ libraries.",
  "sinks": "Modification of 'data' dictionary and return values that influence plotting behavior, particularly adding 'plotmarks' to 'tikz libs'.",
  "flows": "Input 'mpl_marker' is used to retrieve corresponding PGF style from dictionaries; if filled marker and conditions match, 'plotmarks' is added to 'data'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code is present; standard mapping logic. No code injection, external calls, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mappings from matplotlib markers to PGFPlots styles, handling filled markers and special cases. The function attempts to translate marker styles using two dictionaries, adding 'plotmarks' library as needed. It manages key errors gracefully, returning default values when no match is found. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior. No external data access, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for style translation in plotting contexts. No malicious intent or security issues detected. It performs standard lookups and conditional modifications without side effects or vulnerabilities.",
