  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is simply importing functions and metadata from internal modules and exposing them via `__all__`.\n   - There are no indications of input/output handling, network activity, or data processing that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty in their assessments.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports justify a risk score above 0.5. They all conclude the code is benign, with scores of 0 or very close.\n   - This is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malware activity.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's structure and behavior.\n   - The assessments are cautious and justified.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- Based on the code snippet and the reports, I agree with the assessments:\n  - Malware score: **0**\n  - Obfuscated score: **0**\n  - Security risk score: **0**\n\n- No changes are necessary; the code appears entirely benign.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a straightforward module setup with no security concerns.",
