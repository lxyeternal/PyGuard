  "purpose": "This code module provides functions and metadata for converting Matplotlib figures into TikZ/PGFPlots format, intended for figure export and visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (__about__, _cleanfigure, _save) and the code's own definitions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external communication is evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable; the code mainly imports and exports functions and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports metadata and functions from internal modules and defines an export list. There is no dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data processing. No indicators of malicious activity, malware, or security risks are observed in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module for figure conversion with no signs of malicious intent or security threats. It functions as an interface for other components without any suspicious behavior.",
