  "purpose": "Module initializer importing version info and core functions for figure conversion, exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (__about__, _cleanfigure, _save).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports symbols; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export pattern with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup that imports internal functions and metadata, then exposes them via __all__. It contains no input/output operations, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is to define a package interface, and it does not perform any malicious or risky actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions solely as a module initializer for a Python package, and all evidence indicates it poses no security threat.",
