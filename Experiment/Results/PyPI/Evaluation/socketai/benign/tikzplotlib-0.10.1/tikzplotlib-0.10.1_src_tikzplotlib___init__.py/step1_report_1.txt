  "purpose": "Provide functions and metadata for converting Matplotlib figures into TikZ/PGFPlots format.",
  "sources": "Imports __version__ from __about__, clean_figure from _cleanfigure, get_tikz_code and save from _save.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing or output functions evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info and core functions from internal modules, then exposes them via __all__ for public use. It lacks any direct input/output, network activity, or data manipulation beyond module imports/exports. No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module that facilitates figure conversion, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
