{
  "purpose": "This code is a module for converting Matplotlib figures into TikZ/PGFPlots format, primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules __about__, _cleanfigure, and _save; no external data inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks, network connections, or external file writes are present in the visible code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input-to-output paths are evident in this snippet; the code mainly sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior are detected. The code appears standard for a Python package module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info and functions from local modules, then defines an __all__ list for exports. No runtime data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The structure and syntax are straightforward, typical for Python package modules. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup for a Python package focused on figure conversion. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
