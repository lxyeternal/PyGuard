{
  "purpose": "The code processes image data to generate image files and corresponding LaTeX/TikZ code for plotting.",
  "sources": "Reads image array data from objects via get_array(), get_clim(), get_cmap(), get_extent(), and data dictionary for format info.",
  "sinks": "Writes image files using PIL.Image and plt.imsave(), generates TikZ code with file paths.",
  "flows": "Image array data flows from object methods to file saving; file paths are inserted into TikZ code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code features or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads image data via standard library calls (matplotlib, numpy, PIL), processes images based on shape and dtype, saves images, and generates LaTeX code referencing these images. File paths are generated and used explicitly. No hidden or malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The code appears to perform legitimate image processing tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward image processing and code generation utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard libraries and functions without any anomalous patterns or hidden behaviors.",
