{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom Sphinx directive 'furo-demo' to generate tabbed code demonstrations in documentation, supporting MyST and reStructuredText formats.",
  "sources": "Input is from the directive's content (self.block_text), which is user-provided documentation content within Sphinx.",
  "sinks": "The code parses and processes the content into formatted nodes; no external sinks or untrusted data flows are evident. No external system calls or data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "User provides content to the directive → _translate_into_tab_demo splits and formats the content → _FuroDemoDirective parses and renders the content into the document nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed. The code appears standard for Sphinx directive implementation with proper error handling for content parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to split content by separator, generate Markdown and reStructuredText tabbed code blocks, and integrates these into a custom Sphinx directive. It uses safe string manipulation and standard Sphinx and docutils APIs. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or suspicious file operations. The setup function registers the directive safely. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Sphinx extension designed to facilitate documentation with tabbed code snippets. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on static analysis.",
