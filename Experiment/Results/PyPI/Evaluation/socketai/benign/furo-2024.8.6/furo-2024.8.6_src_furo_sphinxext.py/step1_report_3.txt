{
  "purpose": "Provide a custom Sphinx directive 'furo-demo' for rendering code examples in Markdown and reStructuredText within documentation.",
  "sources": "Input comes from the 'block_text' content of the directive, which is user-provided content within the documentation.",
  "sinks": "The code processes user input and generates nodes for the documentation rendering; potential sinks could include unescaped content rendered directly into output, but no external or system effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input (block_text) is split and transformed into formatted code block nodes, then parsed and inserted into the document structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code straightforwardly transforms input into documentation nodes. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to split input text by language, format code blocks for Markdown and reStructuredText, and combine them into tabbed content. The directive class 'FuroDemoDirective' parses the content, converts it into nodes, and inserts into the document. The setup function registers the directive with Sphinx. No code injection, malicious network activity, or secret handling is present. The code strictly manipulates documentation content without executing or evaluating untrusted code beyond formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx extension for documentation formatting with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely processes user input into documentation nodes without external effects or security vulnerabilities.",
