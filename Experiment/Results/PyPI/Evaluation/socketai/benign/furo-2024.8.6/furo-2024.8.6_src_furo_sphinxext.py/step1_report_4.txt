{
  "purpose": "The code provides a custom Sphinx directive 'furo-demo' to generate tabbed demo blocks for documentation, supporting Markdown and reStructuredText formats within Sphinx documentation.",
  "sources": "Input source is the content within the 'furo-demo' directive, which is provided as 'block_text' and processed through internal functions.",
  "sinks": "Processed content is parsed and inserted into a nodes container for documentation rendering; no untrusted data is written to files, sent over network, or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "The 'block_text' input is split into Markdown and reStructuredText parts, converted into tabbed demo sections, and parsed into docutils nodes for rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. Functions perform straightforward string manipulations and parsing. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is used.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to split input based on a separator, format Markdown and reStructuredText blocks into tabbed demo sections, and a Sphinx directive class that parses the content into documentation nodes. It appears to be a standard implementation without suspicious behaviors. The setup function registers the directive properly. No malicious or harmful code constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign Sphinx extension for documentation purposes, converting specified content into tabbed demo blocks. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
