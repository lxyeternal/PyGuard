{
  "purpose": "Provide a custom Sphinx directive 'furo-demo' to facilitate documentation with tabbed markdown and reStructuredText demos.",
  "sources": "Reading the directive content via self.block_text, input to _split_by_language, and contents processed by _md_demo and _rst_demo functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or external connections; no external resource access or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Directive content (self.block_text) is split into markdown and reStructuredText parts, then converted into tabbed content for rendering within documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code mainly transforms input into formatted documentation snippets. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions to split input based on a separator ('+++'), convert blocks into tabbed Markdown and reStructuredText formats, and a directive class that parses and adds this content to the document tree. No external calls, network activity, or data exfiltration observed. Functions are straightforward and focused solely on document formatting. No obfuscated or malicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Sphinx extension aimed at improving documentation formatting. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided implementation.",
