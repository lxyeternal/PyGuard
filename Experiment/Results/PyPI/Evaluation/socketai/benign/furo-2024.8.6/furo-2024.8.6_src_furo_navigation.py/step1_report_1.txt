{
  "purpose": "The code generates and modifies an HTML navigation tree, adding interactive elements such as checkboxes and labels for collapsible navigation.",
  "sources": "The function get_navigation_tree reads input from the parameter 'toctree_html', which is a string containing HTML markup.",
  "sinks": "The code creates and manipulates HTML tags and attributes, primarily inserting tags and modifying class and attribute values within the BeautifulSoup object.",
  "flows": "The HTML input string is parsed into a BeautifulSoup object; then, the code traverses 'li' elements, conditionally adding new tags and attributes, and finally outputs a modified HTML string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of functools.lru_cache to cache results, which could hide potential issues if input varies widely; no external or untrusted data sources are directly used beyond input parameter; no network or system calls are present; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs safe HTML parsing and manipulation using BeautifulSoup. It adds input form controls and labels to HTML list items that contain nested lists, for creating a collapsible sidebar. There are no reads from or writes to external systems, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no evident malicious patterns. The use of input parameters is controlled and contained within the function scope. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is observed. The caching mechanism is benign in this context. Overall, the code performs straightforward DOM manipulation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe utility for generating a collapsible navigation tree in HTML, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It manipulates HTML elements in a controlled manner, with no external dependencies or unsafe operations.",
