  "purpose": "The code modifies an HTML string representing a navigation tree to add collapsible functionality by inserting checkboxes, labels, classes, and icons for UI purposes.",
  "sources": "The input HTML string provided to get_navigation_tree; the DOM elements such as <li>, <ul>, <a> tags within the parsed HTML.",
  "sinks": "The insertion points for labels, checkboxes, and classes within <li> elements that contain nested <ul> tags; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code parses the input HTML, identifies <li> elements with children, adds checkboxes and labels as the first children, marks the current page, and appends classes; no external data flow or code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code performs straightforward DOM manipulation with static tags and attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code uses BeautifulSoup to parse the input HTML string and iterates over all <li> elements. For each <li> with nested <ul>, it adds a 'has-children' class, inserts a label with a toggle icon, and a checkbox input to control collapse/expand behavior. It also marks the last 'current' <li> with an additional class. The operations are static, safe, and intended solely for UI enhancement. No external calls, code injection, or malicious behavior are detected. The use of functools.lru_cache is benign, optimizing repeated calls with the same input. Overall, the code is a benign utility for static HTML DOM modification, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static HTML manipulation utility designed to enhance navigation trees with collapsible UI elements. It does not perform any malicious actions, external data handling, or code execution. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
