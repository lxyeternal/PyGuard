{
  "purpose": "The code generates a navigational tree HTML structure with collapsible elements for use in documentation sidebars, specifically with modifications for the Furo theme.",
  "sources": "The input source is the 'toctree_html' string parameter provided to the 'get_navigation_tree' function.",
  "sinks": "The function constructs and manipulates HTML tags using BeautifulSoup, and outputs the modified HTML string. No external sinks are explicitly used for data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input 'toctree_html' is parsed into BeautifulSoup object; the code traverses all 'li' elements, adds checkbox and label elements for collapsible behavior, and marks the current page. The flow is straightforward HTML manipulation without external data or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard HTML manipulation with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious modifications. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The function uses memoization but does not involve external data or secret handling.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by parsing input HTML and iterates over all 'li' elements to identify and mark the current page. For 'li's with nested 'ul', it adds a checkbox and label for collapsible navigation. It assigns unique IDs to checkboxes and marks the current page with a class. The helper function inserts SVG icons for expand arrows. The code operates purely on the provided HTML string, with no external network or system interaction. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate HTML manipulation script designed for UI enhancements in documentation navigation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply modifies static HTML for frontend interactivity.",
