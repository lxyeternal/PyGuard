  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, including extensions, theme options, environment-based resource loading, and static assets.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys; reads environment variables for conditional configuration; appends local path; defines static URLs and inline SVGs.",
  "sinks": "No execution of untrusted data; static configuration only; environment variables influence resource loading but do not execute code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables affect resource inclusion; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; static assets and URLs are used for documentation purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected; inline SVGs are benign; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard static configuration file for Sphinx, utilizing environment variables for conditional resource loading. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The use of environment variables is typical for configuration flexibility and does not introduce security risks. Inline SVG icons are used for documentation aesthetics and are harmless. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, static Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score (0.1) is appropriate, primarily due to environment variable usage, which is standard practice. All reports correctly identify the code as safe and free of malicious activity.",
