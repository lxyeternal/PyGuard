  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Sphinx configuration with no suspicious activity, no data flows from untrusted sources, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely configuration, with environment variables used for conditional resource loading, which is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — appropriate, given the minimal risk associated with environment-based configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The report's reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code reads environment variables but does not process untrusted input or execute malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The report accurately notes the absence of dynamic code execution or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correctly identified as safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code includes inline SVG icons and environment-based resource loading, but nothing malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The inline SVG is used for icons, not malicious code, and environment variables are used for configuration, which is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Environment variables influence configuration, no code execution vulnerabilities.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard for documentation setup; no untrusted data processing or code execution.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Environment variables and static resources are used for configuration, no suspicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The code is typical for a Sphinx setup, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Benign configuration.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected. The code is purely configuration.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated code:** None observed; all code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to environment variable handling, but this is standard and not risky.\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.05** — minimal, primarily due to environment-based configuration, which is standard practice.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical, benign Sphinx configuration script with no signs of supply chain or security threats.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.05** |\n\nThis reflects a safe, standard configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
