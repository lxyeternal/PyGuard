  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard automation script for Python package development.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- External commands are invoked in a controlled, parameterized manner.\n- Environment variables like 'CI' are used for conditional behavior, which is typical.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious network activity or data exfiltration.\n- The malware score assigned is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities based on the provided analysis.\n- **Error or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The version parsing and external command execution are standard and safe.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** Correctly assigned as 0, since no malicious activity is present.\n  - **Obfuscated:** Correctly assigned as 0; no obfuscation detected.\n  - **Risk score:** Assigned as 0.2, reflecting a low security risk, mainly due to reliance on external commands and environment variables, which is typical in CI/CD scripts but could be slightly exploitable if inputs are compromised.\n\n### Potential points of concern:\n- External command execution (`session.run()`) could be risky if inputs are untrusted. However, in this context, inputs are controlled (version files, fixed commands, environment variables), so the risk remains low.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads or behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- **Malware (0):** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk (0.2):** Slightly elevated due to external command execution, but standard for such scripts; the low score reflects minimal actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is legitimate automation for development workflows.\n- No changes needed to the scores based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports, considering external command execution is controlled and standard)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, low-risk development automation script with no malicious intent or security issues.",
