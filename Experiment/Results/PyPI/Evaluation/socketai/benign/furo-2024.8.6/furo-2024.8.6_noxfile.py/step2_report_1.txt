  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard automation script for Python package development, including version management, documentation, linting, testing, and release workflows.\n- All reports agree that the script uses external commands via `session.run()` for tasks like git operations, packaging, testing, and documentation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- Environment variables are used mainly for configuration (e.g., 'CI'), not sensitive data.\n- The version parsing and determination functions are straightforward.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident in the code or its flow.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Clear, no issues.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard for CI/CD scripts.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the script is typical automation with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard patterns and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the controlled nature of external command execution and standard CI/CD practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Highlights the same points: standard development automation, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar assessment, emphasizing the legitimacy of the external commands and version handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the automation nature, external command execution, and controlled inputs, a low risk score of 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard CI/CD automation risks, but no significant vulnerabilities or malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and well-justified. The scores reflect the low security risk and absence of malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No adjustments needed. The code is a legitimate, standard development automation script with minimal security concerns.",
