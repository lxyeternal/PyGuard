{
  "purpose": "This code provides a placeholder warning display function, a non-secure random number generator with a fixed seed, and trivial placeholder functions. It appears to be demonstrative or for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters and class properties; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external communications; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code does not contain data flows from sources to sinks; the functions operate on internal parameters only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a fixed seed in the RNG, deprecation warnings about security concerns, and placeholder functions with no real logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no external data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns. The RNG's fixed seed and deprecation comments indicate non-cryptographic use and acknowledged limitations, not malicious intent. The warning function and placeholder functions are trivial and do not process untrusted data or perform harmful actions. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The low security risk score reflects the minor concern about the RNG seed and comments, but no active vulnerabilities exist.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily demonstrative, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security concern regarding the RNG seed is acknowledged but does not constitute a security threat. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the analysis.",
