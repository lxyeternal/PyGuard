{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for warnings and random number generation, along with placeholder functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters and class attributes; no external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows that could cause security issues are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present; the code appears to be straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a warning display function, a random number generator class using a seed, and two simple placeholder functions for string concatenation. The RandomNumberGenerator class notes deprecation and security concerns about randomness but does not perform any insecure operations or external data transmission. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be documentation or placeholder code with no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
