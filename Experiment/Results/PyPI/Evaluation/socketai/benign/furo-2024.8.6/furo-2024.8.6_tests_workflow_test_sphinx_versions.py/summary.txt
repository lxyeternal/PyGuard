  "conclusion": "The script is a standard compatibility testing tool with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. The primary security risk stems from external dependencies and subprocess execution, which could be exploited if dependencies are malicious or the environment is compromised. No malicious activity is detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.2) due to supply chain considerations."
