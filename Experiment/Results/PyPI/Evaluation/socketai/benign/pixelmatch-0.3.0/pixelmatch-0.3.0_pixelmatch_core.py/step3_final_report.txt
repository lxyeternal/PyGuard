  "purpose": "A function to compare two images pixel-by-pixel, generate a diff image highlighting differences, and count mismatched pixels.",
  "sources": "Input image data arrays (img1, img2), optional output diff image, and parameters for thresholds and colors.",
  "sinks": "Drawing functions (`draw_pixel`, `draw_gray_pixel`) modify output image; color_delta and antialiased read pixel data.",
  "flows": "Source data (img1, img2) flows through comparison and delta calculation; differences are visualized via drawing functions; mismatches increment counter.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network/system interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image diff operations with proper validation, no malicious or obfuscated logic. It uses utility functions typical for image processing. No external or hidden behaviors are present. The logic is straightforward, and the scoring in reports aligns with its benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign image comparison utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score should be 0, and the obfuscated score should be 0. The security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by potential misuse of output images but not indicative of actual security threats.",
