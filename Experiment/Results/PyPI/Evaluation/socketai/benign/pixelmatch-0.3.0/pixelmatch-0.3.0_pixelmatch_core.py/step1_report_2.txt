{
  "purpose": "This function compares two images pixel-by-pixel to identify differences, generate a visual diff, and count mismatched pixels.",
  "sources": "Reads image data arrays (img1, img2, output), reads function parameters for threshold and options.",
  "sinks": "Calls drawing functions (draw_pixel, draw_gray_pixel) to modify output image data; raises ValueError on invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "Input image data -> color_delta calculation -> anti-aliasing checks -> drawing diff pixels to output -> counting differences.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. Usage of image processing functions appears standard. No external network connections or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a pixel comparison between two images, including optional anti-aliasing detection and diff visualization. It validates input sizes, compares pixel color differences, and conditionally draws diff pixels. Error handling is straightforward. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code behavior are present. Functions like color_delta, antialiased, draw_pixel, and draw_gray_pixel are imported and assumed to be standard utility functions. The overall structure and flow indicate typical image diff computation without suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image comparison function with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It operates purely on image data for visual diff generation and pixel mismatch counting, with appropriate input validation. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is detected.",
