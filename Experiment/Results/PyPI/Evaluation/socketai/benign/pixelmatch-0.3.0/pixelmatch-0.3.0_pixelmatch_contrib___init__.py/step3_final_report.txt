{
  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on code analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, system info, or external inputs; code execution points such as network calls or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, file modifications, or system commands that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., network sockets, file writes), possibly via dynamic code execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious functions like eval/exec, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors; code appears benign with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either empty, utility functions, or involve standard data processing with no evidence of malicious intent. Confidence levels are moderate to high based on limited visibility, and no suspicious patterns or behaviors are detected. The lack of obfuscation and malicious functions supports a benign assessment. Security risk scores are low (0.2), justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Malware scores are zero, aligning with the analysis. Overall, the code appears safe with minimal inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk and malware scores are appropriate. The assessments are consistent and justified given the limited code context. No adjustments are necessary.",
