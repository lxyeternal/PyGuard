{
  "purpose": "Importing local modules .core and .utils using wildcard imports, likely to include their contents into the current namespace.",
  "sources": "The import statements themselves, which read from local modules .core and .utils.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the code only imports modules without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports, which can obscure imported symbols and reduce code clarity, but do not inherently indicate malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. No external data, network activity, or malicious code is present. Wildcard imports are discouraged for maintainability but are not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet. The main concern is stylistic, not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious behavior. Wildcard imports pose a maintainability concern but do not constitute a security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no malicious activity is detected.",
