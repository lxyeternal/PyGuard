{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'core' and 'utils' modules within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.core and .utils)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output points are visible in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in the provided code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure what is being imported, potentially hiding malicious or unnecessary code. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements that include all symbols from the 'core' and 'utils' modules within the package. This practice can mask unwanted or malicious code if those modules are compromised or contain malicious content. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code in this snippet alone. Since this is only an import statement and does not perform any operation, it provides minimal surface for malicious activity. The code appears to be standard package importation, but the use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged due to potential security and maintainability concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet does not contain malicious behavior, but the use of wildcard imports warrants caution as it can hide malicious or unintended code in the imported modules. No active malicious or suspicious activity is present in this minimal code fragment.",
