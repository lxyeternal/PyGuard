  "purpose": "The code imports all functions, classes, or variables from the local modules 'core' and 'utils'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules ('core' and 'utils')",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could leak data",
  "flows": "Not applicable; simple import statements with no data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code only imports modules and does not contain malicious patterns or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules, which is common in Python packages. No evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The import pattern does not involve dynamic execution or hidden code. Since only imports are shown, no additional context suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements with no suspicious or malicious activity. There are no security concerns based on this snippet.",
