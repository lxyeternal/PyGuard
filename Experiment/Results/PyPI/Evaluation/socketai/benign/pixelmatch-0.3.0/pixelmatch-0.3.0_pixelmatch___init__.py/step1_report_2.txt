{
  "purpose": "This code imports all functions and classes from the modules 'core' and 'utils', likely for internal use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules; no input or external data sources are read directly.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here as there are only import statements; no execution logic or data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure the origin of imported functions and classes, potentially hiding malicious or unintended imports. However, this is a common pattern in some codebases and does not directly indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing everything from 'core' and 'utils' modules. There are no function calls, data handling, network operations, or other executable logic present. The use of wildcard imports can reduce code clarity and may be discouraged, but it does not imply malicious behavior on its own. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are detected in these statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and limited to import statements with no apparent malicious intent. While the use of wildcard imports can be considered a code quality concern, it does not indicate security risks or malware. Overall, the code is benign.",
