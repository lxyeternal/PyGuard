  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules using wildcard ('*') imports.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, external data handling, or obfuscated code is presented.\n- The main concern across reports is the use of wildcard imports, which are generally discouraged for clarity and maintainability, but do not inherently introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies local module imports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; wildcard imports are a concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The low security risk score reflects the minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; wildcard imports are a style concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. Slightly higher securityRisk score due to the stylistic concern.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; only import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned. The confidence is high, and the security risk is zero.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; use of wildcard imports is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The slight security concern is acknowledged.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; potential concern about hiding malicious code in modules, but no evidence here.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The caution about hiding malicious code in modules is valid, but since the snippet only shows import statements, no active threat is present.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation; generally low (0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given the context.\n\n**However,** the scores could be standardized further:\n\n- The **confidence** levels are mostly high (0.8-1), which is justified given the simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n- The **security risk** could be uniformly set at 0.1 or 0.2, considering the use of wildcard imports is a stylistic issue but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the consistent absence of malicious activity, I suggest standardizing the security risk at **0.1** for all reports, reflecting a minor concern primarily about code clarity rather than security.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** (wildcard imports are a style concern but not a security threat)\n\nThis balanced view recognizes the stylistic issues but confirms the benign nature of the code snippets.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which is a stylistic and maintainability issue rather than a security threat. The scores are reasonable, but I recommend uniformity with a security risk score of 0.1 across all reports.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set security risk score at **0.1** for consistency.",
