  "purpose": "This code imports all functions and variables from the 'core' and 'utils' modules within the same package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.core' and '.utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') which can obscure what is imported and may hide malicious or unwanted code, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code inclusion. The use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged due to clarity and potential for importing unwanted or malicious objects, but it does not inherently imply malicious intent. No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard in structure, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can impact code clarity but is not malicious. Overall, the snippet is benign.",
