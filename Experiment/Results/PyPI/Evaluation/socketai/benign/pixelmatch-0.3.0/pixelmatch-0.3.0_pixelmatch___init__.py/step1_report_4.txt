{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and variables from the 'core' and 'utils' modules within the same package, likely for setup or initialization purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.core and .utils)",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is evident in the snippet; it only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure which components are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code, but alone it is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with wildcard imports, which are generally discouraged due to lack of clarity and potential for importing unintended or malicious components. However, these lines alone do not perform any malicious actions or data handling. No external inputs, network connections, or data manipulations are present. The code appears to be standard module import statements within a package, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple import statements with no malicious intent or security risks evident from these lines. The use of wildcard imports is a stylistic concern but not a security threat.",
