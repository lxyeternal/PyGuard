  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code only contains import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. No malicious code, data flow, or external interactions are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report correctly notes that wildcard imports can obscure what is imported and are discouraged, but they do not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign analysis. Security risk is low (0.1). Confidence is high (0.8). No adjustments needed.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above—only import statements with wildcards.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report emphasizes the same points about wildcard imports, which is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, matching the benign assessment. Security risk is slightly higher at 0.2, which seems justified given the wildcard imports' potential to hide unwanted code, though not malicious per se.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Only import statements; no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report correctly states that no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, which is appropriate. Confidence is perfect at 1.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern—import statements only.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report mentions that wildcard imports can be a stylistic concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring and reasoning are sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others—import statements only.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report notes the potential for hiding malicious code via wildcard imports but finds no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable given the use of wildcard imports, which can be a concern but do not directly imply malicious intent.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippets and analysis.\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can be risky in larger, more complex codebases, but in this minimal context, it doesn't constitute a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to wildcard imports, which are a minor concern but not inherently dangerous)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign; the scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary based on these snippets.",
