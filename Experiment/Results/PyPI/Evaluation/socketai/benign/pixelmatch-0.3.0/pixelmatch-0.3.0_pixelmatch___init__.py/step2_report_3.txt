  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .core import *\nfrom .utils import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code only contains import statements with wildcard imports from local modules `.core` and `.utils`.\n- No other code, data flows, network activity, or suspicious operations are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo malicious behavior or active security issues are evident in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states that the code imports everything from local modules; no data flows or sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard imports are discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Risk & Malware scores:** Both set to 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8, appropriate given the minimal code.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the use of wildcard imports and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2 (some concern over code clarity), confidence 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Focuses on the benign nature of import statements; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the high confidence is justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar to previous reports, highlighting the use of wildcard imports and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1, confidence 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Notes the potential concern with wildcard imports possibly hiding malicious code but finds no evidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with the main concern being the use of wildcard imports.\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious intent, data leaks, or active security risks.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is correct given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the use of wildcard imports, which can impact maintainability and clarity, a small but non-zero risk score (e.g., 0.1) is justified. However, since no malicious activity is detected, it should not be higher than 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** High (around 0.8), as all reports agree on benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                       | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                       | Code is straightforward; no obfuscation detected.           |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1 - 0.2               | Minor concern over wildcard imports affecting clarity.     |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no active security threats.** The main concern remains the stylistic choice of wildcard imports, which should be avoided for clarity and maintainability but does not constitute a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nContinue monitoring for any malicious modifications to the imported modules themselves, but based solely on this snippet, there is no indication of malicious activity.",
