  "purpose": "Provides functions to compare two PIL.Image instances for differences using the pixelmatch algorithm, outputting diff images and returning mismatch counts.",
  "sources": "Reads image data from PIL.Image objects via from_PIL_to_raw_data, and optional output image data. No external untrusted data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "Writes diff image data back to the output PIL.Image object via putdata(). No external network or file system operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Image data is converted from PIL.Image to raw data format, processed by core.pixelmatch, and optionally written back to a PIL.Image via putdata() after conversion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code structures detected. The code uses standard image processing functions with no obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code converts PIL.Images to raw data format for comparison, leveraging an external core.pixelmatch function, then converts and writes back results. There are no external inputs other than the provided images and no external outputs or network communication. The functions appear straightforward and focused solely on image comparison without malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as an image comparison utility without any indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It operates solely on image data with no network, file system, or secret handling involved. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this module.",
