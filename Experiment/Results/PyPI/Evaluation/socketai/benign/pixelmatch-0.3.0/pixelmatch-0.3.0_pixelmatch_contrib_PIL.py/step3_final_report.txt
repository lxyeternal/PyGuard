{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to compare PIL.Image instances by converting them to raw data, invoking an external pixelmatch core function, and converting results back to PIL images.",
  "sources": "Reads input images via PIL.Image.convert() and getdata(); reads output image data if provided.",
  "sinks": "Writes diff image data back to a PIL.Image via putdata().",
  "flows": "Converts PIL images to raw data, passes data to core.pixelmatch, then converts diff data back to PIL format if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secret handling detected; straightforward data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image data conversions and calls an external pixelmatch function for comparison. No external network, file I/O beyond images, or malicious code observed. The data flow is transparent, and functions serve a benign utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for image comparison using PIL and an external core library. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks is present.",
