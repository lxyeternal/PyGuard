  "purpose": "Define type aliases for numeric sequences and color tuples in Python.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; type alias definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input to processing or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward type alias declarations with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing constructs and defines type aliases for sequences of numbers, mutable sequences, and RGB color tuples. The comment notes a workaround for type aliasing, but there are no input handling, data processing, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be purely for type hinting purposes without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only type alias definitions for clarity and type checking, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
