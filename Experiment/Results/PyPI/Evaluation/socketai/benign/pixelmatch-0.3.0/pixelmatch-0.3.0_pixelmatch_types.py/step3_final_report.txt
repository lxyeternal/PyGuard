  "purpose": "Define type aliases for numerical and sequence types used in image processing and data handling.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and comments within the code, specifically the import of typing modules and the alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code contains only type alias definitions with no data flow or runtime logic.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is purely type aliasing without data flow or executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with some comments indicating potential unnecessary aliasing, but these are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several type aliases for numbers, sequences, and tuples related to image data, using Python's typing module. It contains no executable logic, data input/output, or external interactions. Comments suggest some workaround or unnecessary aliasing, but these are benign and do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is purely for type hinting and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type alias definitions with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
