{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various numerical and sequence types used in image processing or data handling.",
  "sources": "No data input or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No data output or processing that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, source-to-sink, in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates some perceived necessity for the type alias 'Number', but this does not suggest malicious intent; it appears to be a workaround or clarification.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of type alias definitions using Python's typing module, establishing labels for complex data structures like sequences of numbers and RGB tuples. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are observed. The comment hints at some workaround but does not indicate malicious intent or malicious code. Overall, this code is purely definitional and does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely type alias definitions intended for type hinting. It contains no malicious behavior, no data processing, and no security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase for image or numerical data handling, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
