  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple type alias definitions using Python's typing module.\n- No data input/output, processing, or executable logic is present.\n- Comments suggest some workaround or perceived unnecessary definitions, but nothing malicious or suspicious.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The comments hint at some workaround or frustration but do not introduce security concerns.\n- The type aliases are standard and serve as helpful annotations in larger codebases.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, justified given the benign nature.\n- The confidence is 1 in all cases, which is reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security-related issues.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. They correctly identify that this is a benign, purely definitional snippet with no security concerns. The scoring reflects this understanding appropriately.",
