  "purpose": "Define type aliases for numerical and image-related data structures for type hinting.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading; only type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; purely type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; no runtime data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of type aliasing with no runtime impact; comment about unnecessary definitions suggests awareness of potential issues but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains type alias definitions using Python's typing module, with no functions, data processing, or input/output operations. No evidence of data leaks, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. The comment indicates some concern about necessity, but it does not impact security. The code is straightforward and does not introduce risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type hinting with no malicious intent or security risks present.",
