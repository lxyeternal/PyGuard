  "purpose": "Define type aliases for numerical and image data structures using Python typing hints.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs within the code.",
  "anomalies": "The comment suggests a workaround for a potential type hinting issue, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines type aliases using Python's typing module. It includes an import statement, type alias definitions for Number, ImageSequence, MutableImageSequence, and RGBTuple, and a comment about a workaround. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or any code execution. The comment indicates a possible compatibility or typing issue, but this does not introduce malicious behavior. No suspicious code, obfuscated elements, or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as type alias definitions for clearer code annotation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
