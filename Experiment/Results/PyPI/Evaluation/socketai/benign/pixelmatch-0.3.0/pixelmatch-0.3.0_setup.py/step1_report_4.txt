  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the pixelmatch Python package, including metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, package lists, and configuration parameters; does not read external input.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'setup' function to install the package; no untrusted data sinks or security-impacting operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Defines package data and metadata, then passes them to 'setup' for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. The code is straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and defines package information such as name, version, description, author, URL, and package data. It specifies dependencies, packages, and modules explicitly. No dynamic code execution, no external input processing, no code obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior are present. All functions and data are standard for Python package setup. The script does not contain any code that performs network connections, data leaks, or malicious actions. It appears to be a legitimate setup script for distributing the 'pixelmatch' package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines package metadata and configuration for installation.",
