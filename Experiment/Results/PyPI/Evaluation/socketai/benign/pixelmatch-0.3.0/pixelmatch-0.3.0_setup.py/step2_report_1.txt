  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, static setup script for packaging the 'pixelmatch' library.\n- No external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is purely declarative, defining package metadata and invoking `setup()`.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The reports correctly identify that the script is benign, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since the code is a standard setup script, the only possible concern could be if it was modified to include malicious code, but no such modifications are evident here.\n- The detailed documentation and metadata do not raise any security concerns.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final justification:**\n- The code is a typical setup.py for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- All reports' conclusions are accurate and justified.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, benign, and typical for open-source package distribution.",
