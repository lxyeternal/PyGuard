  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- It imports `setuptools`, defines package metadata, package data, modules, and invokes `setup()` with these parameters.\n- No dynamic code execution, external input handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The script appears to be static and solely intended for package configuration and distribution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:** None detected.\n- **Code obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Sensitive data or credentials:** None present.\n- **Dynamic or runtime operations beyond static configuration:** None.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All describe the code as a **standard, benign setup script**.\n- They note **no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external inputs, no malicious behavior**.\n- They assign **malware scores of 0** and **security risk scores of 0**.\n- Their confidence levels are high (1), which is justified given the code's simplicity and static nature.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is correct, as there's no indication of any security threat.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or anomalies?\n- No. All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- **Should be 0.** No malicious activity or code is present.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **Should be 0.** The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- **Should be 0.** No security risks identified.\n\n**Additional comments:**  \n- The reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all conclusions are based on static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Suggested Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                      | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                      | Code is clear, straightforward, and un-obfuscated.          |\n| Security Risk      | 0                      | No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or security issues.          |\n\n**This setup script is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code.**",
