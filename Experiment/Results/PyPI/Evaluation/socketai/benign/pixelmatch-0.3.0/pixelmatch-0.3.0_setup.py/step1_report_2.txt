  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pixelmatch' Python library, including metadata and configuration for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, package data, module list, and setup parameters; no input or untrusted data sources present.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup to process package installation; no dangerous sinks such as network connections, file modifications, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; data flows from static variables to the setup function, with no external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. No malicious behavior or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata, package data, and dependencies. It strictly follows typical packaging conventions without executing or importing untrusted code. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. All parts are static and intended for distribution purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code.",
