  "purpose": "Compute Levenshtein distance and ratio between two sequences for string similarity measurement.",
  "sources": "Input sequences 'seq1' and 'seq2' provided to 'distance' and 'ratio' methods.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally without external output or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input sequences are read in 'distance' and 'ratio' methods; results are computed internally without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Levenshtein distance algorithm using numpy for matrix operations. It calculates the distance matrix via dynamic programming, comparing characters of input sequences. The ratio function normalizes the distance by sequence length. No external data, network activity, or environment variables are used. The implementation is clear, correct, and aligns with typical algorithms. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is purely computational and self-contained.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Levenshtein distance and ratio calculation. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
