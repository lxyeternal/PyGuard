{
  "purpose": "This code implements the Levenshtein distance algorithm for string similarity measurement, providing methods to calculate distance and ratio scores.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all input data comes from function parameters (seq1, seq2).",
  "targets": "The primary data flow is from input parameters to calculations within the functions; no external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input sequences (seq1, seq2) are processed within the distance and ratio functions, with no external data flows or outputs directed elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Usage of numpy is standard for matrix operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static methods for calculating Levenshtein distance and ratio. It initializes a zero matrix for dynamic programming, populates it based on string comparisons, and returns the computed distance. The implementation follows standard algorithms without any dynamic code execution, external network activity, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of the Levenshtein distance algorithm with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It solely performs string similarity calculations as intended.",
