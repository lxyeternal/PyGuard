  "purpose": "Implement a Levenshtein distance calculation with ratio normalization for string similarity.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the ratio and distance methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> distance calculation -> ratio computation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Uses numpy for matrix operations, which is standard for such algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Levenshtein class with static methods for computing string distance and ratio. It uses numpy to create and manipulate a matrix for calculating edit distance, following the standard algorithm. No external data is fetched, and there are no network, file, or environment variable operations. The logic appears straightforward and consistent with typical implementations of Levenshtein distance. No obfuscation, suspicious behavior, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Levenshtein distance calculation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions solely as a string similarity utility.",
