{
  "purpose": "Implementing Levenshtein distance and similarity ratio calculations using numpy for string comparison.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy as np; no external input sources within the code snippet itself.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code performs purely computational operations without external data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "The functions use internal calculations based on input strings to produce a distance or ratio; no external flows or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. The only notable aspect is the use of numpy for matrix calculations, which is standard for such algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static methods to compute Levenshtein distance and ratio between two sequences. It uses numpy arrays to implement the distance matrix efficiently. No input validation, external input handling, or output beyond computational results is included. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The implementation is typical for string similarity calculations, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Levenshtein distance and ratio calculations with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs purely computational tasks without external interactions or suspicious behavior.",
