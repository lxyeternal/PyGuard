{
  "purpose": "This code implements a class for calculating the Levenshtein distance and similarity ratio between two sequences.",
  "sources": "The code reads input sequences through the methods 'ratio' and 'distance', which accept 'seq1' and 'seq2' as parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data for further effects; the code only performs calculations based on input sequences.",
  "flows": "Input sequences are passed to 'ratio' or 'distance', which compute distance matrices and return results. No untrusted data is sent to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses 'numpy' for matrix operations, which is standard for such algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Levenshtein class with methods to compute distance and ratio between sequences. It uses numpy to initialize and manipulate a distance matrix, following standard algorithmic approaches. No external data sources, network operations, or suspicious code constructs are present. The implementation appears straightforward and intended solely for string similarity calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard Levenshtein distance and similarity calculations without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It does not contain obfuscation or suspicious logic. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
