{
  "purpose": "This code implements Levenshtein distance and similarity ratio calculations for sequences (strings).",
  "sources": "Input sequences (seq1, seq2) provided to ratio and distance methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used in a way that can cause data leaks or effects; no output other than returning calculated values.",
  "flows": "Input sequences are read in the ratio and distance methods; calculations are performed, and results are returned without side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors. Use of numpy is standard for matrix operations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with static methods to compute Levenshtein distance and similarity ratios. It initializes a matrix for dynamic programming calculation, using numpy for array handling. The logic follows standard algorithms without any suspicious or malicious modifications. No input validation or sanitization issues, but also no malicious code is present. The code appears straightforward and purely mathematical.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Levenshtein distance and ratio calculation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs sequence similarity computations in a typical manner, with no malicious intent detected.",
