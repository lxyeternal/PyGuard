{
  "purpose": "The code performs keyword extraction from input text, utilizing stopword lists and similarity metrics to deduplicate candidates.",
  "sources": "Reads stopword files from local filesystem, processes input text via DataCore class, and uses external libraries (jellyfish, custom Levenshtein) for string similarity.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmission; primarily local file I/O and in-memory processing.",
  "flows": "Reads stopword files -> processes text with DataCore -> computes similarity between candidates -> deduplicates based on threshold -> returns keywords.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling that suppresses errors; reliance on local stopword files which could be manipulated if environment is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward keyword extraction utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or network behavior. External libraries are standard and trustworthy. Exception handling is broad but only logs warnings, not executing code or exfiltrating data. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard keyword extraction module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current security assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
