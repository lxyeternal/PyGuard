{
  "purpose": "The code defines a KeywordExtractor class for processing text to extract keywords, leveraging stopword lists and various similarity metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads input text in extract_keywords() method; reads stopword list files from the filesystem during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network or system modifications are present; no data leaks or sensitive data handling is observed.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into extract_keywords(), which uses stopword files and data processing classes; no external or untrusted data flows into or out of the code beyond file reading.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains broad exception handling that suppresses errors during stopword file reading and main processing, which may hide issues but does not suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious file paths are detected. No network activity or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads a stopword list from the filesystem, processes text using internal data structures, and performs similarity calculations. The use of jellyfish library for string similarity is standard. The exception handling may mask errors but does not indicate malicious behavior. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. The overall structure and functions align with standard keyword extraction implementations without suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign keyword extraction utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads stopword files, processes text, and performs similarity calculations. There is no evidence of malware, data leakage, or sabotage.",
