{
  "purpose": "This module is designed to extract keywords from input text, utilizing stopword lists and various string similarity metrics.",
  "sources": "The code reads stopword list files from the filesystem and processes input text passed to the extract_keywords method.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used insecurely, such as network or database operations. The only potential concern is reading stopword files, but this is standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Input text flows from the extract_keywords method into DataCore object creation, which processes text and generates candidates. These candidates are then deduplicated based on similarity functions before being returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or hidden backdoors. The code primarily performs standard file I/O, string processing, and similarity calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external libraries (string, os, jellyfish) and internal modules (Levenshtein, DataCore). It reads stopword lists from files, with fallback handling if files are missing or unreadable, printing warnings. The keyword extraction process involves creating a DataCore instance, generating features, and selecting top candidates based on heuristic scores and similarity measures. Similarity functions use external libraries and internal logic, with no user input or network interactions involved. Exception handling is present, but only logs warnings without executing risky operations. No evidence of malicious intent or security issues is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform intended keyword extraction with proper handling of files and data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall structure and logic are consistent with standard text processing routines.",
