{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for extracting keywords from a text, using various similarity functions and stopword lists, primarily for text processing and feature extraction.",
  "sources": "File system reads for stopword list files, reading stopword data, and input parameter 'text' in 'extract_keywords' method.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or network operations; no external data transmissions or untrusted data handling beyond file reading and processing.",
  "flows": "Reads stopword list files → processes input text in 'extract_keywords' → constructs DataCore object → filters and deduplicates keywords → returns keywords with scores.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard data processing logic with no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data flows are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and a third-party library 'jellyfish' for string similarity. It loads stopword files from local paths, with fallback encoding. The 'KeywordExtractor' class initializes with various parameters, selecting a similarity function. The main method 'extract_keywords' processes input text, creating a 'DataCore' object, building features, and selecting top keywords based on similarity thresholds. No external network calls, no command execution, and no sensitive data handling are evident. All file operations are confined to local stopword list files, and no user data or secrets are hardcoded.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate keyword extraction utility with no malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It performs local file I/O and in-memory processing without external communication. No malware signatures or obfuscated code are present.",
