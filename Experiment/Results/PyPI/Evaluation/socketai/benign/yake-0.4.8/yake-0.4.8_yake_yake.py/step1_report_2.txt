{
  "purpose": "This code defines a KeywordExtractor class designed to extract keywords from a given text, using stopwords and similarity functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input text in extract_keywords method; reads stopword list from a file based on language; uses external libraries jellyfish and custom Levenshtein for string similarity; reads files from the local filesystem for stopwords.",
  "sinks": "None detected that could lead to data leaks, code injection, or malicious data manipulation; no untrusted data outputs or external network calls present.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into extract_keywords, processed into DataCore object, which generates candidate terms; stopword list is read from files; similarity functions compare candidate strings to deduplicate.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. File reading operations with exception handling are standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input text, loads stopword lists from local files, and applies string similarity measures from external libraries for deduplication. The use of exception handling for file reading is safe; no use of user-supplied data for network operations or sensitive data. The only potential concern is reading stopword lists from files, which is standard practice. The external libraries used are common and trustworthy, and there are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate keyword extraction utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or supply chain sabotage indicators.",
