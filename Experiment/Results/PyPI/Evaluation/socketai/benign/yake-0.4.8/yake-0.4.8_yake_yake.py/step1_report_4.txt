{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a keyword extraction module that processes text data to identify and rank keywords based on various similarity measures and deduplication methods.",
  "sources": "Reads input text in the extract_keywords() method; reads stopword lists from files based on language settings; accesses file system to locate stopwords files.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external system calls. No network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input text -> DataCore processing -> keyword candidates -> similarity calculations (jaro, levenshtein, seqm) -> output of keywords.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except block with broad exception handling; fallback to printing warnings rather than proper logging; reliance on local file system for stopwords, which could be manipulated if file system is compromised. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs text processing and keyword extraction by reading stopword lists from files, applying similarity metrics, and filtering results. The similarity functions use the 'jellyfish' library and a custom Levenshtein ratio. The code structure is straightforward, and no obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors such as network connections, file modifications, or code injections are present. The broad exception handling and print statements are minor concerns but do not indicate malicious intent. No malware signatures or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard keyword extraction implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs text processing safely and locally. Minor concerns include broad exception handling and reliance on local files, which could be replaced or manipulated if the environment is compromised, but these do not constitute malicious activity.",
