  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation for the 'yake' project.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys', 'os', and 'yake' to determine version info and modify sys.path.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path; imports 'yake'; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Path modification and version import; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward configuration code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script. It adjusts sys.path to include the project root, imports 'yake' solely to access version info, and sets documentation parameters. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, handling of untrusted input, or obfuscated code. The import of 'yake' is benign and typical for version retrieval. No secrets, credentials, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard configuration file for documentation purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
