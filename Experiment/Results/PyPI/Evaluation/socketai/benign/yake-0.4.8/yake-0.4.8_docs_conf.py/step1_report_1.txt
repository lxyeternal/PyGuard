  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation using Sphinx for the 'yake' package.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys', 'os', and 'yake'; reads environment with 'os.getcwd()'; reads version from 'yake.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "None in this script; no untrusted data outputs or network communications.",
  "flows": "Imports 'yake' after modifying 'sys.path'; uses 'os.getcwd()' and 'os.path.dirname' to determine paths; reads version info from 'yake'.",
  "anomalies": "Commented out or benign code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no evident malicious behavior. It modifies 'sys.path' to include the project root directory, which is common for documentation generation. The code imports the 'yake' package to extract its version info, which is a typical practice. No network activity, no handling of untrusted input, no sensitive data access, or suspicious code patterns are present. All functions and operations are benign setup steps for documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard configuration file for generating project documentation with Sphinx. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this module.",
