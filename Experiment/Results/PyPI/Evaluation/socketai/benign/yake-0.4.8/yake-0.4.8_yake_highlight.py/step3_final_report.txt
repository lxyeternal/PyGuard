  "purpose": "A Python class for highlighting keywords and n-grams within text by wrapping them with customizable tags.",
  "sources": "Input text string; keywords list (including tuples for multi-word phrases).",
  "sinks": "Processed text string with highlighted keywords; no external data or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input text -> tokenization and regex cleaning -> keyword matching (single or n-grams) -> replacement with highlight tags -> output text.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try/except blocks masking errors; regex patterns are standard; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward string processing for keyword highlighting, supporting multi-word phrases. It uses regex for token cleaning, handles both unigrams and n-grams, and replaces matched tokens with highlighted versions. No external network, file, or system modifications are present. Exception handling is broad but not malicious. Regex patterns are standard for token cleaning. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The code's purpose is benign, and its logic is transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward text highlighter with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2) due to broad exception handling. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
