{
  "purpose": "The code implements a text highlighting utility that emphasizes specified keywords within input text, supporting n-gram matching and flexible highlighting formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text via the 'highlight' method parameter; keywords are provided as a list or list of tuples.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks for untrusted data such as network connections, file writes, or system commands within this code.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed and matched against keywords to produce highlighted output, with keyword matching guiding text modifications.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs broad exception handling without specific error management, which can obscure underlying issues. There are no evident hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The use of regex for token cleaning appears standard, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script provides functions for keyword highlighting within text, supporting both unigrams and n-grams. It converts keywords to lowercase, removes punctuation, and highlights matching tokens. No external data sources, network operations, or system modifications are present. Exception handling is overly broad, but this does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code's structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The core functionality is benign, focusing on text processing without harmful side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign text highlighter with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward keyword highlighting with no external dependencies or data leaks. The broad exception handling is a minor concern but not indicative of malicious intent.",
