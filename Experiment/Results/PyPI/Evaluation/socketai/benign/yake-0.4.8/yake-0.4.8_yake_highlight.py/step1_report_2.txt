{
  "purpose": "The code provides a text highlighting utility that wraps specified keywords within input text using custom or default highlight tags.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'text' (string), 'keywords' (list of strings or tuples), and class initialization parameters like 'max_ngram_size'.",
  "sinks": "The code manipulates strings locally; no untrusted data flows to external systems, network, or file I/O; no data leakage or network transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input text and keywords are processed within highlight functions; keywords are matched and wrapped with highlight tags, without external data transmission or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution present. The regex patterns are straightforward and used for string cleanup. No hidden or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs string manipulation and pattern matching to highlight keywords within a text. It accepts input data and processes it locally, using regex for token cleaning and comparison. There are no external network connections, no reading of environment variables, nor any data exfiltration mechanisms. The regex patterns and string replacements are safe and standard for text processing. No malicious or sabotage behavior, such as data theft, system commands execution, or backdoor creation, is evident. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not contain hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a text highlighter based on provided keywords. It processes data locally without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. No malware or security risks are present, and the overall security profile is safe.",
