  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's behavior, and evaluate the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a text highlighter, wrapping specified keywords with customizable tags.\n- It processes both single-word and n-gram keywords.\n- Uses regex for token cleaning.\n- No external network or file operations.\n- Exception handling is broad but not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- No dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or external dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; describes a safe text highlighter.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; broad exception handling noted but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious or suspicious features.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (very low)\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The scores seem appropriate. The low malware and obfuscated scores align with the code's behavior. The slight security risk score accounts for broad exception handling, which is a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; describes a benign highlighting utility.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or external interactions.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Valid; safe, straightforward code.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1\n  - Confidence: 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are reasonable. No malware or obfuscation indicated. Security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; standard highlighting.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; safe code.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher, but still low)\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The slightly higher security risk score (0.2) is acceptable, perhaps reflecting the broad exception handling, but overall, the code remains benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Valid.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1\n  - Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated (0.1-0.2) due to broad exception handling, but no real vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, as the analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n- The code appears safe, with no signs of supply chain or malicious compromise.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Metric             | Score  | Justification                                                                 |\n|--------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors detected.                |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Clear, readable code; no obfuscation patterns present.                     |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1-0.2 | Minor due to broad exception handling, but overall very low risk.          |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, straightforward text highlighter with no malicious or suspicious features.",
