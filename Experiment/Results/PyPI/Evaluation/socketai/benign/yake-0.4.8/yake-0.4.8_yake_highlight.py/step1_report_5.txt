{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to highlight specified keywords in a given text, supporting n-gram highlighting and customizable highlight tags.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'text' parameter of the 'highlight' method and from the 'keywords' parameter; it also accesses class attributes for configuration.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that output data to external systems, network, or files. It primarily processes and returns highlighted text.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' and 'keywords' flow through processing functions, leading to formatted and highlighted text output; no external or untrusted data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs regex substitutions to clean tokens, which is standard; no suspicious or obfuscated code structures, no hardcoded credentials or hidden functionalities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a text highlighter, processing input text and keywords to produce highlighted versions based on n-gram matching. It uses regex for token cleaning and contains complex logic for multi-word phrase matching. No external network, file access, or system manipulation is present. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions are straightforward, with error handling that does not introduce security concerns. The overall design focuses on text processing and highlighting, with no evident malicious or maliciously obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard text highlighting utility with no malicious intent. It contains no malicious behaviors such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors. The code structure is typical and does not exhibit obfuscation. The security risk score is low, and malware likelihood is negligible. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
