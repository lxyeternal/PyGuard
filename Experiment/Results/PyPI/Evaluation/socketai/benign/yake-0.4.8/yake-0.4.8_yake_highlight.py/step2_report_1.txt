  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a text highlighter, supporting n-gram and keyword highlighting.\n- No external network, file, or system interactions are described or evident.\n- Regex patterns are used for token cleaning, but these are standard and not suspicious.\n- Broad exception handling exists, which is a minor concern but not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are identified.\n- All reports assign very low security risk and malware scores (mostly 0).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n**Code functionality:**\n- The code processes input text, matches keywords (including multi-word phrases), and highlights them with customizable tags.\n- No external data sources or network calls.\n- No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic.\n- Regex patterns are used for token cleaning, but they are standard.\n\n**Malicious behaviors:**\n- No signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or system modification.\n- No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.\n- No suspicious code constructs.\n\n**Error handling:**\n- The code uses broad try/except blocks, which can mask errors but are not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Logical issues or potential concerns:\n\n- The broad exception handling could hide bugs, but this is a code quality concern, not security.\n- Regex patterns are somewhat inconsistent (e.g., in `format_one_gram_text` vs `find_more_relevant`), but not malicious.\n- The code operates purely locally on strings.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n| Aspect | Reported Score | Reasoning | Recommendation |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Malware | 0 | No malicious activity detected | Keep at 0 |\n| Obfuscated | 0 | No obfuscation observed | Keep at 0 |\n| Security Risk | 0.1 - 0.2 | Minor concern due to broad exception handling, but no real risk | Possibly increase slightly to 0.2 for transparency, but still very low |\n| Risk | 0.1 - 0.2 | No vulnerabilities or malicious features | Keep low |\n\nThe scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. No report suggests any malicious intent or dangerous behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malware behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minor concern due to broad exception handling, but overall very safe.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, mainly due to exception handling practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard text highlighter with no signs of malicious or supply chain attack behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's actual functionality.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe based on the provided analysis.",
