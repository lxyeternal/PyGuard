{
  "purpose": "A text highlighting utility that emphasizes specified keywords within a given text, supporting n-gram matching and customizable highlight tags.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods: 'text' and 'keywords'. No external data sources or network calls are present.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not write data to files, send data over network, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' and 'keywords' flow into highlight() -> format_n_gram_text() or format_one_gram_text(), where tokens are processed and modified for highlighting.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs string manipulation and regex-based replacements; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are detected. No use of eval, exec, or unsafe code execution. No external network activity or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a keyword highlighting mechanism, supporting single and multi-word (n-gram) keywords with customizable tags. It performs tokenization, regex cleaning, and replacement operations to wrap keywords with highlight tags. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or privilege escalation. The logic appears focused solely on text processing without side effects. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are evident. The regex patterns used are standard for token cleaning and do not suggest malicious intent. The code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious code paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign text highlighting utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply processes input text to emphasize certain keywords using specified tags, without performing any external operations or unsafe actions.",
