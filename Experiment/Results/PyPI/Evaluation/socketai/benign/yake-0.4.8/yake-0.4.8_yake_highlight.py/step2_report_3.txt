  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings from Reports:**\n\n- **Purpose & Functionality:** All reports agree that the code is a text highlighter that wraps specified keywords (including multi-word n-grams) with customizable tags. It performs string processing, tokenization, regex cleaning, and highlighting.\n\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or system modifications are present. The code operates solely on input parameters and returns processed text.\n\n- **Flows & Logic:** The text flows through functions that identify keywords, clean tokens with regex, and replace tokens with highlighted versions. It handles both unigrams and n-grams, with some complex logic for multi-word matching.\n\n- **Anomalies & Potential Risks:** \n  - Broad exception handling (`try/except`) without specific error management appears in the code, which could mask errors but is not malicious.\n  - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution.\n  - Regex patterns are standard for token cleaning and do not suggest malicious intent.\n  - No external communication, data exfiltration, or system modification behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risks:**\n  - All reports assign a malware score of 0.\n  - Security risk scores are very low (~0.1 to 0.2), indicating minimal concern.\n  - No signs of malicious payloads, sabotage, or supply chain attacks.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior?** No. The code is purely for text highlighting.\n- **Is there obfuscation?** No, the code is straightforward.\n- **Are the scores reasonable?** Yes, all reports assign malware scores of 0 and low security risks, consistent with their analysis.\n- **Any assumptions about vulnerabilities?** The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they only describe functionality.\n- **Any inconsistency?** No. The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and understandable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal security concern, mainly due to broad exception handling, which is not malicious.\n\n**My Overall Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — the code does not exhibit any malicious traits.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, mainly due to broad exception handling which could mask errors but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured text highlighting utility with no signs of malicious or supply chain risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
