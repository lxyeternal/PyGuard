  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import a keyword extraction class for a Python package named 'yake'.",
  "sources": "Package metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__), import statement for 'KeywordExtractor' from 'yake.yake'.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static metadata and import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The import appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata variables with static strings, which is typical for Python packages. It imports 'KeywordExtractor' from the internal module 'yake.yake'. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or external network activities are present. The structure and content are straightforward and consistent with normal package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization file containing metadata and a module import, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
