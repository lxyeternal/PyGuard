  "purpose": "Define package metadata and import the KeywordExtractor class from the yake.yake module.",
  "sources": "Package metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__), import statement (from yake.yake import KeywordExtractor).",
  "sinks": "Import statement could potentially import malicious or compromised code if the package or module is compromised, but this is a standard import.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class from an external module, which could lead to execution of external code during import if the module is malicious or compromised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this minimal setup code; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initialization file with metadata and an import statement. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The import statement is standard practice, and there is no indication of malicious intent. The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or other suspicious actions. It appears to be a typical setup for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package init file with metadata and an import statement. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
