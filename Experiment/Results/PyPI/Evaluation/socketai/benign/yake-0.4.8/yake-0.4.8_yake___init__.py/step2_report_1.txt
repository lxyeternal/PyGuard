  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a minimal, straightforward `__init__.py`-like file that sets package metadata and imports a class from the internal module.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or suspicious patterns are described.\n- The import statement is standard practice, assuming the module exists.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippet provided matches the described purpose: setting metadata and importing `KeywordExtractor` from `yake.yake`. No discrepancies or errors are evident.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports suggest any malicious behavior or code execution beyond a standard import.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; the code is a typical package initialization file.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-specific analysis:\n\n#### Malware score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious behavior is present.\n- Since the import is from an internal module, unless that module is compromised, there's no malware risk. The report correctly reflects this.\n\n#### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n#### Risk score:\n- All reports assign a score of 0 or 0.5, with some reports explicitly stating no risks detected.\n- Given the simplicity and the absence of suspicious activity, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- No justification exists for higher scores unless there are external factors not described here.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No assumptions are made beyond standard package structure.\n- No overestimation of risk or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- **Potential adjustments:** None necessary; the assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a typical, benign package initialization file with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code content.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's straightforward nature.",
