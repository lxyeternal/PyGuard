{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__) and imports the KeywordExtractor class from the internal yake.yake module.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata variables and imports from yake.yake.",
  "sinks": "The import statement loads a class from an internal module; no untrusted data handling or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Package metadata variables are set; the import statement loads internal code without executing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard __init__.py file for a Python package, setting metadata and importing a class from an internal module. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present. The import is from a local module, assuming the module exists and is safe. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices indicate a benign package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign package setup file with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. All signals and scores are consistent with this assessment, and no issues are identified.",
