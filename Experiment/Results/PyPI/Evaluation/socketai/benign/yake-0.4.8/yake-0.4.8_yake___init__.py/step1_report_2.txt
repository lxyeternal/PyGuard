{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the top-level package initialization for the 'yake' library, setting metadata and importing the main class.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__), import statement for 'KeywordExtractor' from 'yake.yake'",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines metadata and imports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials (besides author info), or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file, containing metadata and a single import statement. It does not include any user input handling, data processing, or network activity. The import statement simply makes 'KeywordExtractor' available at the package level. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. It primarily sets package metadata and imports a core class. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
