{
  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the 'yake' package and imports the KeywordExtractor class.",
  "sources": "Metadata definitions (__author__, __email__, __version__); import statement for 'KeywordExtractor'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data influences other parts of the code; no external data handling.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables are static; import statement loads a class from a package, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward package metadata and import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata such as author, email, and version. It imports a class 'KeywordExtractor' from a local package module. No user input, environment variables, or external data processing present. No suspicious or malicious constructs detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are evident. The import statement assumes the presence of 'yake.yake' module, which is typical for a package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package metadata and import statement with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears to be a typical package initialization file.",
