  "sinks": "There are no sinks or places where untrusted data could cause data leaks or other effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward, defining metadata and importing a single module.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__) and imports a core component from the 'yake' package. There are no suspicious functions, no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no network or file operations. It appears to be a standard package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple package metadata and import statement with no signs of malware or security issues.",
