  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines package metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__).\n- Imports `KeywordExtractor` from `yake.yake`.\n\n**Actual code behavior:**\n- Very minimal, standard package initialization.\n- No dynamic code, no user input, no network activity.\n- The import statement is standard, assuming the module exists and is safe.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  **No.** The code is straightforward and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The report's logic aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk)?**  \n  All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0, which is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Accurate; no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Correct; standard package init, no suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Same as above.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Accurate; straightforward, no anomalies.\n- **Score justification:** No issues.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Correct; no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Consistent with the code.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Correct; standard package setup.\n- **Score justification:** Consistent.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risk evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` style file for a Python package, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's simplicity.",
