{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of unit tests for the 'yake' keyword extraction library, verifying its functionality on sample texts in English and Portuguese, including keyword extraction and text highlighting.",
  "sources": "Static text samples embedded within test functions, used as input for keyword extraction.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data inputs; operations are confined to in-memory processing with static data.",
  "flows": "Input texts → 'yake' keyword extraction → TextHighlighter highlighting keywords → Assertions verifying output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscated code, secrets, or external interactions present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite performing in-memory keyword extraction and highlighting on static data. It contains no network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The code structure is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The test functions serve to verify the correctness of the 'yake' library's functionality. The print statements are for debugging purposes and do not pose security risks. The detailed review confirms that the code operates within a controlled environment, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for the 'yake' keyword extraction library. It processes static input data, performs safe in-memory operations, and includes no suspicious or malicious elements. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the analysis.",
