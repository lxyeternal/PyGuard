{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the 'yake' keyword extraction and text highlighting library, designed to validate its functionality on different texts and languages.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from string variables containing sample texts in English and Portuguese within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No data is passed to untrusted sources, nor are there any sinks that handle untrusted data that could lead to leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from predefined text variables into the 'extract_keywords' method, then into the 'highlight' method, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code strictly performs testing of a known library with no suspicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries and the 'yake' package, then defines several test functions that process static text samples. These functions perform keyword extraction and highlighting, then compare results to expected outputs. All data is hardcoded sample text; no external inputs, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code appears to be a straightforward test suite for the 'yake' library. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious code injections, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test script verifying the functionality of the 'yake' keyword extraction and text highlighting library. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or malware within this module.",
