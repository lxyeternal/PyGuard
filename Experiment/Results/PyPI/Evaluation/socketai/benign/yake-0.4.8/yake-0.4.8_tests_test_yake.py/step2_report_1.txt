  "review": "Let's analyze the code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of test functions for the 'yake' keyword extraction library.\n   - It imports standard testing libraries (`pytest`, `click.testing`) and the 'yake' package.\n   - The test functions process static, hardcoded text samples in English and Portuguese.\n   - There are no network operations, file I/O, or external data sources involved.\n   - The code only performs in-memory keyword extraction and text highlighting, with assertions to verify correctness.\n   - No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The print statements are used solely for debugging or verification, typical in test scripts.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as a benign, standard test suite.\n   - No mention of any malicious behavior, secrets, backdoors, or security risks.\n   - The detailed reasoning confirms that the code operates within a controlled environment, with no external threats or malicious intent.\n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis — no malware detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, as the code performs only testing on static data.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The code does not include any external inputs or untrusted data sources.\n   - The operations are safe, standard testing procedures.\n   - No signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious payloads.\n\n**Final Justification and Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard test suite for the 'yake' keyword extraction library. It only processes static data, performs in-memory operations, and includes no suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious behavior or payloads detected.                                 |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is clear, readable, and straightforward.                                |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 | No vulnerabilities, external data, or malicious activities involved.      |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
