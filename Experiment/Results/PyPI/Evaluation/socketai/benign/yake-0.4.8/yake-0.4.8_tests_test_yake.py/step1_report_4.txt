  "purpose": "Unit testing scripts for the 'yake' keyword extraction and highlighting library.",
  "sources": "Imports of pytest, click.testing, yake, and yake.highlight; usage of these modules to perform keyword extraction and highlighting.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or inputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input text contents are fed into 'extract_keywords' and 'highlight' functions, but these are controlled inputs within the test code. No untrusted data from external sources flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code strictly performs testing of the 'yake' library's functions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard testing libraries and the 'yake' keyword extraction library. It defines several test functions that process specific text contents for keyword extraction and highlighting. The tests verify the correctness of extracted keywords and their highlighting. All inputs are static and defined within the code. No external data sources or network calls are present, and the code does not execute any untrusted input or perform malicious actions. The structure and logic are typical of unit tests for a natural language processing library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of unit tests for the 'yake' keyword extraction library. It performs keyword extraction and highlighting on predefined texts and verifies correctness. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code. It appears safe and solely intended for testing purposes.",
