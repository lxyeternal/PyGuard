  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for the 'yake' Python package, including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package requirements, package metadata, and package structure definitions; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; no database or network operations are performed.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The script follows standard setup.py structure. No dynamic execution or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to configure package installation. It specifies requirements, package data, and entry points. No external inputs are processed at runtime; the script purely defines package metadata and dependencies. All dependencies are publicly available and well-known. No malicious or suspicious code, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any runtime data processing, network operations, or contain hidden backdoors. Overall, it appears safe.",
