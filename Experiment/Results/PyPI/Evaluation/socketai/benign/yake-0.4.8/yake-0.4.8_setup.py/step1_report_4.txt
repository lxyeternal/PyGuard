{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'yake', which is designed for keyword extraction in text processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings (like the README and requirements lists), imports from 'setuptools', and gathers package information from the environment.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function and its arguments, which handle package installation, metadata, and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Static data (package info and requirements) flows into setup() to configure package build and installation processes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. All imports and data are standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script utilizing setuptools to package the 'yake' keyword extraction library. It imports only necessary modules, defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration options. The long description is a static string with no dynamic or external data fetching. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. All dependencies are common Python packages, and there are no signs of hidden or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup file with no signs of malware, malicious activity, or security risks. It functions solely to configure package installation and distribution.",
