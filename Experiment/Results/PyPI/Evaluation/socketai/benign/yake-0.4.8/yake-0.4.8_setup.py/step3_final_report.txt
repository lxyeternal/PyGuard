  "purpose": "Standard setup.py configuration for packaging the 'yake' Python project, with no dynamic code or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, external communication, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging, containing no dynamic or malicious elements. External URLs are documentation and repository links, not embedded code or data sources. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors are present. All dependencies are standard, and the script is static. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The slight elevation to 0.1 in one report is a conservative estimate but not justified by actual code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scores should reflect zero malware, zero obfuscation, and minimal security risk. The minor risk score of 0.1 can be standardized to 0 for consistency.",
