  "purpose": "Setup script for the YAKE! keyword extraction Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads static metadata, dependencies, and package configuration data from code and variables; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no handling of untrusted data or external data sources that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the script only defines package configuration and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code is standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration using setuptools for a Python package. It defines package information, dependencies, entry points, classifiers, and other metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, or external data fetching that could introduce security risks. The code does not include any suspicious behaviors or malicious constructs. All elements are standard for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities. It is a typical configuration file for a Python package, with no anomalous or malicious code present.",
