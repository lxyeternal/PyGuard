  "purpose": "A command-line tool for extracting keywords from input text or files using the YAKE keyword extraction library.",
  "sources": "Input text from command-line option '--text_input' or from a file specified by '--input_file'.",
  "sinks": "Reading input file content, printing the results with tabulate.",
  "flows": "User provides input via command line options; the input is passed to the 'run_yake' function which processes it using the 'yake' library, then outputs the results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no network calls or system modifications. The code uses standard libraries and a well-known keyword extraction library.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a CLI with options for input text or file, language, and keyword extraction parameters. It verifies input validity, then processes the text through the 'yake' library's 'KeywordExtractor'. It outputs the results formatted as a table. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper for YAKE without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No external network activity, no data leakage, and no code obfuscation are present. It strictly performs text processing and displays the output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign command-line utility for keyword extraction. It does not contain any malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. It simply wraps an existing library for keyword extraction with input validation and formatted output.",
