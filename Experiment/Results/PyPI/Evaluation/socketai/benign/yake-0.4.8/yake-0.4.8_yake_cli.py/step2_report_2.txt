  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the associated code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It's a CLI tool that extracts keywords from input text or a file using the 'yake' library.\n- It performs input validation to ensure only one data source is used.\n- It reads the input, processes it with YAKE, and outputs the results formatted as a table.\n- Uses standard libraries ('click', 'tabulate', 'yake') with no suspicious patterns, code obfuscation, or external network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **No issues or malicious code are present.** The code is straightforward, safe, and intended for legitimate text processing.\n\n### Logical, Reasoning, or Summary Flaws:\n- **No flaws detected.** The reports correctly identify the script as a benign CLI utility with proper input validation and no suspicious behavior.\n\n### Score Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: Very low (0.1 to 0.2)\n- These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Risk Score Justification:\n- Since there's no malicious code, no external network activity, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious patterns, a **risk score of 0.0** is appropriate.\n- The only minor concern might be reading user-specified files, but this is standard for CLI tools and not inherently risky.\n\n### Malware Score:\n- Clearly, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score should be 0.0.**\n\n### Obfuscated Code:\n- The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Obfuscated score should be 0.0.**\n\n### Overall Security Assessment:\n- No vulnerabilities, no suspicious behavior, and no malicious intent are evident.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Adjust the scores to reflect the benign nature:**\n  - **Malware:** 0.0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n  - **Risk:** 0.0\n\n### Additional notes:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified.\n- The code is a standard CLI wrapper around a well-known library for keyword extraction.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type     | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0.0                 | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.0                 | Code is clear and straightforward.                            |\n| Security Risk  | 0.0                 | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.            |\n\nThis review confirms the code is safe and benign.",
