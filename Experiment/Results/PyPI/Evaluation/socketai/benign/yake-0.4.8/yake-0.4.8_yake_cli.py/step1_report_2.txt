{
  "purpose": "Command-line interface for extracting keywords from input text or files using the YAKE keyword extraction library.",
  "sources": "User input parameters, command-line options, input file reading",
  "sinks": "Reading from input file, printing output; no direct data leaks or insecure operations identified",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> run_yake() -> yake.KeywordExtractor -> extract_keywords() -> output display",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; input validation ensures only one data source is used",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard CLI tool utilizing the 'click' library for parameter parsing and 'yake' for keyword extraction. It performs input validation to prevent both input sources being specified simultaneously. The code reads input either from a string or a file and then processes it with YAKE. No external network connections, no data exfiltration, or suspicious code patterns are present. The functions and data flow are straightforward, with no obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign keyword extraction CLI utility with proper input validation. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It safely processes input data and outputs results without exposing or leaking sensitive information.",
