  "purpose": "A CLI utility for extracting keywords from input text or files using the 'yake' library.",
  "sources": "Input text provided via command-line option or input file read from disk.",
  "sinks": "Results are printed to the console; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input is read from user-specified source, processed by 'yake.KeywordExtractor', and output as a table.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around the 'yake' library, performing input validation, reading input safely, and outputting results. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. External libraries are standard and well-known. The input validation prevents misuse, and the code does not contain any suspicious patterns or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low risk) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI utility for keyword extraction with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
