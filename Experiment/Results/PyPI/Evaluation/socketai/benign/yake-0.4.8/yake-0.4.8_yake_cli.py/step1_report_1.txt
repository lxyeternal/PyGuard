{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract keywords from input text or a file using the YAKE keyword extraction library and display the results in a tabular format.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line options '--text_input' or '--input_file'.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is reading from a file specified by '--input_file'. The extracted keywords are printed to the console; no other data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input is obtained from user options, then passed to the 'run_yake' function, which processes the text and outputs the results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of external libraries (click, yake, tabulate) is standard and not suspicious. No unsafe data handling or code injection points are identified.",
  "analysis": "The script performs command-line parsing to accept user input or files. It conditionally reads data based on user options and processes the text through the YAKE library for keyword extraction. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. External libraries are used as intended. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are detected. The input handling is safe; no direct evaluation or injection points are present. The only potential concern is reading files directly specified by user input, but this is typical for such tools and not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard command-line utility for keyword extraction with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely reads user input or files, processes data with established libraries, and outputs results without suspicious activities.",
