  "purpose": "Command-line utility for extracting keywords from text or files using the YAKE algorithm.",
  "sources": "Input text from command-line option '--text_input' or file input from '--input_file'.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that handle untrusted data in a way that could cause harm or data leakage; only reading input and printing output.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user-supplied options into the 'run_yake' function and then to the 'extract_keywords' method, with results printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. No code injections, external network calls, or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI tool using 'click' that processes input text or files to extract keywords via the 'yake' library. It performs input validation, reads files safely, and outputs results with 'tabulate'. The 'yake' library itself is used for keyword extraction and does not contain malicious code. No external network calls or suspicious behaviors are present. The code adheres to typical CLI patterns and handles user input securely without executing untrusted code directly or leaking data.\n\nOverall, the code appears benign, focused on text processing, with no evident malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard CLI utility for keyword extraction, with no malicious or malicious-suspicious behaviors detected. It reads user input securely, processes it, and outputs results without risky operations.",
