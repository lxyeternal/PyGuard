{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for extracting keywords from text or files using the 'yake' library.",
  "sources": "Input is read from command-line options '--text_input' or from a specified file via '--input_file'.",
  "sinks": "The main data sink is the 'run_yake' function which processes the input text with 'yake.KeywordExtractor'. No untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input data (text_input or file content) flows into 'run_yake', where it is passed to 'yake.KeywordExtractor.extract_keywords'. No external or untrusted data flows beyond this processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code relies on external library 'yake' which is standard for keyword extraction.",
  "analysis": "The script defines command-line options, ensuring mutual exclusivity between text input and file input, and processes the text accordingly. No code injection, unsafe SQL, or suspicious activity is evident. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The use of external library 'yake' is legitimate and not suspicious. The script does not perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI tool for keyword extraction with standard usage patterns. No malicious or supply chain threats are detected.",
