{
  "purpose": "The code implements a text processing pipeline for keyword and phrase extraction, involving tokenization, candidate phrase generation, co-occurrence graph construction, and feature computation.",
  "sources": "Reads input text, tokenizes sentences and words, and processes tokens for candidate phrase generation and co-occurrence analysis.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or file I/O; operates entirely within memory and data structures.",
  "flows": "Input text -> tokenization and filtering -> candidate phrase creation -> co-occurrence graph updates -> feature calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of jellyfish for string similarity is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive NLP utility focused on phrase extraction and feature analysis. It uses standard libraries and techniques without network activity or system manipulation. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's complexity and external library use are typical for NLP tasks. The code does not perform any suspicious actions such as network communication, file writing, or code injection. The use of jellyfish for string similarity is common and not malicious. The logic and structure are clear, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate NLP processing component with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the absence of external threats or malicious activities.",
