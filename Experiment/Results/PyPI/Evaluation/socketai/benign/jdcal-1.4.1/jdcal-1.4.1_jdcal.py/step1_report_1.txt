{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for converting between Julian, Gregorian, and Julian calendar dates, including handling of proleptic calendars and Julian date calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input date parameters (year, month, day) and Julian date components (jd1, jd2).",
  "sinks": "Returns Julian date tuples; no sinks that process untrusted data directly or lead to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Input date parameters are used in conversion functions to compute Julian dates, which are then converted back to calendar dates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code performs straightforward date calculations with standard mathematical operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-documented algorithms for date conversions, including support for negative and out-of-range months/days. It uses mathematical functions from the standard library without dynamic code execution or obfuscation. No network activity, system modifications, or suspicious data handling is observed. The code does not contain any malicious logic such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. It appears to be a standard date calculation utility module based on established algorithms, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of calendar and Julian date conversion functions. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for date calculations without any suspicious or malicious actions.",
