{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for converting between Julian, Gregorian, and Julian calendar dates, supporting proleptic calendars for astronomical and calendrical calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as year, month, day, and internal math functions (math.modf, math.fmod). No external data sources or user input beyond parameters.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are tuples of floats representing Julian dates or calendar components; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (year, month, day) are processed through mathematical algorithms to produce Julian date components; no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard astronomical algorithms for date conversions, handling proleptic calendars, leap years, and date splitting for precision. It uses well-known formulas and math functions without external dependencies or dynamic code execution. The extensive comments and examples demonstrate correctness. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of calendar conversion functions, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safe, transparent, and well-understood algorithms suitable for scientific or calendrical applications.",
