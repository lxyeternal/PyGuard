{
  "purpose": "Provide functions for converting between Julian and Gregorian/Julian calendar dates, supporting proleptic calendar calculations with high precision splitting for date-time accuracy.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as year, month, day, and the combined Julian date inputs (jd1, jd2).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or external effects. The code performs pure calculations without network, file, or environment interactions.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves input parameters (year, month, day, jd1, jd2) being processed through date conversion algorithms, resulting in date components or Julian date tuples. There are no external or untrusted data flows beyond standard input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments identified. The code appears to implement standard astronomical date conversion algorithms based on well-known formulas. No obfuscated language features or unnecessary dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The module provides well-documented functions for converting between Gregorian and Julian calendar dates and their Julian date equivalents, supporting proleptic calendar calculations. Functions utilize mathematical operations typical for date conversions, with no external data sources or network communication. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection mechanisms. The code strictly adheres to standard algorithms for date calculations, with clear separation of concerns and no hidden behaviors. The use of floating-point splitting enhances date-time precision, but does not introduce security concerns. Overall, the code appears to serve a scientific purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of date conversion algorithms for astronomical or calendrical computations. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and benign, serving its intended purpose without security concerns.",
