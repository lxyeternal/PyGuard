  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' -> import 'jdcal' -> retrieve version -> setup with package info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of standard setup tools and straightforward package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools. It reads a description file, imports the package to get its version, and calls setup() with package metadata. No untrusted data handling, dynamic code execution, or external network activity. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. All elements are standard for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures the 'jdcal' package for distribution.",
