{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging the 'jdcal' Python module for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the long_description from 'README.rst' file; imports 'jdcal' to get version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from 'jdcal' module; reads description from a local file; passes data to 'setup()'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a local module 'jdcal' to retrieve its version and reads a local README file for description. The setup() function configures package metadata and does not execute any code beyond static data collection. There are no inputs from external sources at runtime, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity or data leaks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It only performs package configuration tasks typical for distributing Python modules.",
