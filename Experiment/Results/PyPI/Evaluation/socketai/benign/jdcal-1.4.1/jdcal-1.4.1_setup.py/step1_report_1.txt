{
  "purpose": "This script is used to package and distribute the Python module 'jdcal' via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from 'jdcal.__version__' and the long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'setup()' function which processes the package metadata and files.",
  "flows": "Reads version from module -> uses in setup() -> reads README file content -> passed to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no network connections, no suspicious file handling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and the 'jdcal' module to obtain version info. It reads the README file for long description and then calls 'setup()' with metadata. No user input, environment variables, or network activity observed. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Use of standard library and no obfuscated or unusual code structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply packages the 'jdcal' module for distribution.",
