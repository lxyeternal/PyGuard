  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate plugin management CLI with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the execution of package code during validation, which warrants a cautious malware score of 0.1 and a risk score of approximately 0.2–0.3. These scores are appropriate given the operational context and inherent risks, but no malicious intent or sabotage is detected."
