  "conclusion": "The core code is a standard, well-designed plugin management system with no embedded malicious or obfuscated code. The main security risk stems from the dynamic execution of plugin functions, which could be exploited if plugins are malicious. Ensuring plugin integrity and trust is essential. The malware score should be low (~0.2-0.3), obfuscation score zero, and overall security risk moderate (~0.4). The code itself is safe; risks are external and trust-dependent."
