  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring:\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a typical __init__.py or module setup file for a Python package.\n- It performs standard operations: fetching version info, setting metadata, importing internal modules/functions, and defining __all__.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted data are present.\n- The version retrieval uses importlib.metadata, which is a standard and safe approach.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as a package initialization script.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no security concerns.\n- **Notes:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states the code's purpose.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Notes:** The analysis emphasizes the safety and standard nature of the code.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code is standard for package setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Notes:** No issues.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Correct; straightforward package setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Notes:** No suspicious activity.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Correct; standard pattern.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Notes:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly interpret the code as a benign package initialization script.\n- **Malware risk:** All scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code content.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0, as no obfuscated or suspicious code is present.\n- **Security risk:** 0, no risky behaviors or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**  \nAll reports agree on the benign nature, and the code's simplicity supports that. No report suggests any malicious activity or suspicious patterns that warrant a higher score.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — standard package setup with no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe package initialization script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the evidence, I agree with the current scoring. No adjustments are necessary.",
