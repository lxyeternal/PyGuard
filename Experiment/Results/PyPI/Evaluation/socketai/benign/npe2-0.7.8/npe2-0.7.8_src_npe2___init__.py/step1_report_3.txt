{
  "purpose": "This code initializes module metadata and imports specific functions and classes from local submodules for package functionality.",
  "sources": "Reading package version using importlib.metadata; importing functions and classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow detected; the code only performs metadata retrieval and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The version detection is standard and does not involve user input.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to obtain the package version using importlib.metadata, which is standard for version retrieval. It sets author and email metadata as static strings. The imports are from local modules with no dynamic or external code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious logic. The overall structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, focusing on package metadata and standard imports. No malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
