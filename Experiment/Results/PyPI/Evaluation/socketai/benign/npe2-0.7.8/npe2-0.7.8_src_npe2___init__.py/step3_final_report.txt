  "purpose": "Initialize package metadata, retrieve version info, and expose internal modules/functions for external use.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() call, static module imports, setting __author__, __email__, __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Version retrieval from importlib.metadata -> setting __version__; static imports and metadata assignments -> exposing via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization tasks: safe version retrieval with exception handling, static imports of internal modules, setting author and email metadata, and defining __all__ for public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of importlib.metadata is a safe, standard practice. No untrusted data handling or network activity is present. The code structure is simple and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard package setup, and poses no security risks. All signals and scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are appropriately zero, consistent with the code content.",
