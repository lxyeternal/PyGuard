  "purpose": "A minimal CLI entry point that imports and executes the main function from npe2.cli.",
  "sources": "Import statement from npe2.cli and the __name__ check for script execution.",
  "sinks": "Execution of npe2.cli.main() when run as a script.",
  "flows": "Import npe2.cli.main -> call main() upon script execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Python CLI pattern. It imports a main function from an external module and executes it if the script is run directly. No data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation are evident. The security posture depends entirely on npe2.cli.main(), which is outside this snippet. The code itself is benign, with no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the external npe2.cli.main() implementation. Based solely on this snippet, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score can be set to 0.05 to reflect very low inherent risk.",
