  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the external npe2.cli.main() implementation. Based solely on this snippet, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score can be set to 0.05 to reflect very low inherent risk."
