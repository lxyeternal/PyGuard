  "purpose": "To invoke the main function from the npe2.cli module when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "Import statement for npe2.cli and the __main__ check triggering main()",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission",
  "flows": "Import statement to function call within the main check, but no data flow analysis applicable due to lack of data handling",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script that imports a main function from an external module npe2.cli and executes it if the script is run directly. No input/output handling, data processing, or network activity is present in this fragment. It appears to be a standard entry point setup without any suspicious constructs or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical script entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely delegates execution to an external main function. Based on this fragment alone, there are no indications of malware or security concerns.",
