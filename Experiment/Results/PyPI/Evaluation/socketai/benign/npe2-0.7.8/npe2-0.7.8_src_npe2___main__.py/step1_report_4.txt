  "purpose": "This code executes the main function from the npe2.cli module when run as a script.",
  "sources": "The import statement from npe2.cli and the __name__ check for the main script execution.",
  "sinks": "Calling the main() function, which may internally execute further code.",
  "flows": "Importing npe2.cli and executing main() when __name__ == '__main__'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the main function from the npe2.cli module and executes it if the script is run directly. It is a standard entry point pattern in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or external data leakage. The security depends on the internal implementation of npe2.cli.main, which is outside the scope of this snippet. The code itself is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical entry point for a command-line interface application, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
