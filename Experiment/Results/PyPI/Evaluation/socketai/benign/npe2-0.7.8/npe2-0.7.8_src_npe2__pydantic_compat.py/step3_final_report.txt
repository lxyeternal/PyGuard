{
  "purpose": "The code provides a compatibility layer to import specific components from the 'pydantic' library, supporting both version 1 and version 2 by attempting to import from 'pydantic.v1' first, then falling back to 'pydantic' if necessary.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statements from the 'pydantic' library, attempting to load specific modules and classes depending on the version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The flow involves attempting to import from 'pydantic.v1' (source), and if that fails, importing from 'pydantic' (fallback), with no further data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a straightforward compatibility import pattern with no suspicious or unusual code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard try-except import pattern to support multiple versions of the 'pydantic' library, with no data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. It does not handle untrusted input or execute external commands. The import logic is common and benign, and the code's purpose is solely to ensure compatibility across library versions. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is static and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, compatibility-focused import setup for the 'pydantic' library, with no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
