{
  "purpose": "This code manages conditional imports of the pydantic library, supporting both v1 and v2, and defines public API exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import source of pydantic modules, depending on the availability of pydantic v1 or v2.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations are present; the code solely manages module imports and exports.",
  "flows": "Imports flow from external packages (pydantic) into the namespace; no data flows from user input or external sources into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The conditional import pattern is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import pydantic v1 modules and, if that fails, falls back to pydantic v2 modules, ensuring compatibility. All imported names are standard pydantic components. The __all__ variable explicitly exports these components. There is no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no interaction with external untrusted inputs. The structure is clean, and the logic is simple, aimed at maintaining compatibility across different pydantic versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility layer for pydantic library imports and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs straightforward module management and export declarations.",
