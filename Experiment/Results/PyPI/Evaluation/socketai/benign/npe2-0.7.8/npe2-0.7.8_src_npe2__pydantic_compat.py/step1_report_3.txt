{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically imports components from the pydantic library, attempting to support both v1 and v2 versions, and then exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statements at the beginning, checking for the existence of pydantic v1 or v2 modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The import flow attempts to load modules based on availability, but no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "The conditional import structure to support multiple versions of pydantic is slightly unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to import specific classes and functions from the pydantic library, supporting both version 1 and 2 by checking for ImportError. This ensures compatibility across different environments. The code then defines __all__ to specify exported components. No user input, environment variables, or data sources are involved. No potential malicious behavior or security issues are detected in this static import setup. The structure is straightforward, with version compatibility handled cleanly. There are no suspicious code paths or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import compatibility layer for the pydantic library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and poses no security risks.",
