{
  "purpose": "The code defines imports from the pydantic library, supporting both version 1 and 2, to be used as a part of a larger Python module for data validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pydantic' package, including version-specific imports depending on availability.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code only imports modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows or processing paths are present; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; conditional import logic is standard practice for version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import various components from the 'pydantic' library, first trying version 1 submodules, and if that fails, importing from the main 'pydantic' namespace, which corresponds to version 2. It then defines __all__ to specify exported symbols. This pattern ensures compatibility across different library versions and is a common approach in maintaining backward compatibility. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors. The structure and content appear entirely benign and typical for a module that prepares dependencies for data validation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version-agnostic import setup for the 'pydantic' library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It serves as a compatibility layer and module setup without any indicators of malware, data leaks, or security risks.",
