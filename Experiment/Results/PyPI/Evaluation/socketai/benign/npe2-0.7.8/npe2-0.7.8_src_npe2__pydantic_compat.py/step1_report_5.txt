{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import various components from the pydantic library, handling different versions (v1 and v2) for compatibility, and then exposing selected imports via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from pydantic library, with version detection logic.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are assigned directly; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains conditional imports to support different library versions, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional imports based on the presence of pydantic v1 or v2, assigning the appropriate modules and components to local names. It then explicitly defines __all__ to control what is exposed when the module is imported. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as malicious code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a straightforward compatibility layer for the pydantic library, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility import block for pydantic library versions, with no malicious behavior detected. It simply manages imports and exposure of components, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
