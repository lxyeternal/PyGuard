{
  "purpose": "This code aims to conditionally import modules and classes from the pydantic library, supporting both version 1 and version 2, and then exports these symbols for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the system's Python environment to import specific modules and classes from the 'pydantic' library, depending on availability.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "The flow involves attempting to import from pydantic.v1, falling back to pydantic if ImportError occurs, then defining __all__ with the imported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The import logic is straightforward and version-aware.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a version check by trying to import from pydantic.v1 first; if it fails, it imports from pydantic, ensuring compatibility with different pydantic versions. It then defines __all__ for symbol exports. No user input handling, external data processing, or risky operations are observed. The code is purely for module setup and compatibility support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version-compatible import setup for the pydantic library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
