  "purpose": "A Python API client wrapper for managing Databricks clusters, constructing payloads from method parameters and sending them via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Method arguments such as cluster_id, worker, worker_type, cluster_name, spark_version, and other configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST and GET requests to API endpoints, sending constructed payloads; no direct data leaks or external data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into payload dictionaries, which are then transmitted via _post or _get methods to API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard for an API client.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API wrapper class for Databricks cluster management, with methods for creating, editing, starting, stopping, resizing, deleting, and listing clusters. It constructs payloads based on method parameters, with minimal validation (notably on worker_type). No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling is present. The methods rely on external _post and _get functions, assumed to be implemented securely. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are found. The flow from input to network request is direct and typical. Given the absence of malicious logic, obfuscation, or security flaws, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for managing Databricks clusters. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with a standard API wrapper. The provided reports are accurate and justified.",
