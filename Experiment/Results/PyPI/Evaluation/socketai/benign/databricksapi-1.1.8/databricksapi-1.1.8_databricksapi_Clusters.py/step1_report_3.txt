  "purpose": "A Python class for managing Databricks clusters via API calls, including creation, modification, control, and querying cluster information.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for methods such as worker, worker_type, cluster_name, spark_version, cluster_log_conf, node_type_id, driver_node_type_id, spark_conf, aws_attributes, ssh_public_keys, custom_tags, init_scripts, spark_env_vars, autotermination_minutes, enable_elastic_disk, cluster_id, start_time, end_time, event_types, offset, limit.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if input parameters contain sensitive information; data sent in API payloads; no evident data exfiltration or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Input data from method parameters flows into API payloads which are sent via self._post() or self._get() methods, likely over network to Databricks endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Use of dynamic URL construction and multiple conditional payload settings is standard. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. The code strictly performs cluster management via API calls with parameters; no suspicious data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass for interacting with Databricks clusters, with multiple methods for creating, editing, starting, stopping, resizing, deleting, and querying clusters. Each method constructs API endpoint URLs and payloads based on input parameters, then calls internal HTTP methods (_post and _get). No code injections, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident. Input parameters are used to build payloads for API calls; there are no operations that involve executing untrusted code, writing files, or network connections outside of API interactions. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data handling mechanisms are present. The class appears to be a straightforward API wrapper for cluster management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper for Databricks cluster management with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It performs expected operations securely, assuming proper API endpoint configuration and secure usage. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
