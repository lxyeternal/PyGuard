  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for managing Databricks clusters. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with a standard API wrapper. The provided reports are accurate and justified."
