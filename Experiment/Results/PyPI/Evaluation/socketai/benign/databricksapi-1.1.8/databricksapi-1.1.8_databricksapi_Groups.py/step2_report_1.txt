  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a class wrapping API calls for managing groups/members in Databricks.\n- It constructs URLs and payloads based on input parameters.\n- It performs HTTP requests via `_post` and `_get`.\n- It validates 'name_type' to be either 'user' or 'group'.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no evident malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code logic appears correct; no issues with the implementation or flow.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No injection, code execution, or data leaks are apparent.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** Low, assuming the underlying request methods are secure.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The code relies on external methods (`_set_url`, `_post`, `_get`) whose implementations are unknown. If these are secure, the overall security is maintained.\n- Payloads are constructed from input parameters, validated for 'name_type'.\n- Exception handling is appropriate for unsupported types.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \n- All conclude that the code is a standard API wrapper with no malicious intent, low security risk, and proper validation.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9), and the malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or concerns:\n- **API request methods (`_post`, `_get`)**: If these are insecure or improperly implemented, they could introduce risks. However, this is outside the provided code scope.\n- **Input validation**: Only 'name_type' and 'return_type' are validated; other parameters are directly used. This is typical for such wrappers but warrants caution if external inputs are not sanitized elsewhere.\n- **URL construction**: The `_set_url` method's implementation isn't shown; if insecure, it could be exploited. But based on the code, no direct issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 seems appropriate, considering it’s a straightforward API wrapper with minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### My recommendations:\n- The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No changes needed unless the underlying request methods are insecure.\n- The overall security posture is low risk, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper for managing groups/members in Databricks, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The reported scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect the code's straightforward nature and the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.",
