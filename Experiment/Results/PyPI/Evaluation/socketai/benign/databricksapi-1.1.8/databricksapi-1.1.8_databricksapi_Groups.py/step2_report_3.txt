  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code and potential security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a class wrapping API calls for managing groups and members in Databricks.\n- It constructs URLs and payloads from input parameters.\n- It performs HTTP requests via `_post` and `_get` methods.\n- It validates 'name_type' inputs, raising exceptions on invalid types.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no evident malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a standard API wrapper with no malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code. This aligns with the code's content.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No significant logical flaws are noted. The exception handling for unsupported 'name_type' and 'return_type' is appropriate. The code's structure is typical for such API wrappers.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). These seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated; score 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The overall security risk is low, given the code's purpose and implementation. The scores (~0.1-0.2) are reasonable.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The main concern could be if `_post`, `_get`, or `_set_url` are insecure or if the URLs are constructed insecurely. However, since these are external methods and their implementations are not provided, we assume they are standard HTTP request wrappers.\n\n- **Data leakage or misuse:**  \n  Payloads include user and group identifiers, but these are from trusted parameters, and the code does not process untrusted external data directly.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **The code is a typical API client wrapper for Databricks group management.**  \n- **No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident.**  \n- **Scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified.**\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent risk, assuming proper implementation of HTTP methods)  \n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward API wrapper with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
