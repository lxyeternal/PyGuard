  "purpose": "A class providing API wrapper methods for managing Databricks workspace resources, including delete, export, import, list, get status, and directory creation.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as 'path', 'export_format', 'content', 'overwrite', and class attributes '_url', '_api_type'.",
  "sinks": "External methods '_set_url', '_post', '_get' which perform network requests with constructed URLs and payloads.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into payload dictionaries, which are then used in HTTP request methods to interact with the API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and relies on external methods for HTTP operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client wrapper for Databricks workspace management. It constructs URLs and payloads from method parameters and calls external HTTP methods. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The parameters are directly passed into payloads, which could pose misuse risks if inputs are untrusted, but this is typical for API wrappers. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature. External method implementations are not shown, so potential vulnerabilities depend on those. Overall, the code appears safe, with low risk of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality. No modifications are necessary; the security posture is sound given the provided context.",
