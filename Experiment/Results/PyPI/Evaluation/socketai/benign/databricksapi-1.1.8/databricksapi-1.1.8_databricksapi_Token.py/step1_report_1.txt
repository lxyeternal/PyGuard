{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for managing tokens via Databricks API, including creating, listing, and revoking tokens.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'url', 'token', 'lifetime_seconds', 'comment', 'token_id'. These are used to configure API requests and manage tokens.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST and GET requests made through self._post and self._get functions, potentially sending sensitive data such as token IDs, comments, or tokens over the network.",
  "flows": "Constructor receives 'url' and optional 'token'; createToken constructs payload with 'lifetime_seconds' and 'comment' and sends via POST; listTokens performs GET request; revokeToken sends 'token_id' via POST to delete endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual logic. The code relies on inherited methods for HTTP requests; no signs of malicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The class appears to be a straightforward API client for managing tokens on Databricks. It constructs URLs dynamically based on input parameters and sends data via POST or GET requests. Sensitive data such as tokens, token IDs, comments, and URL are passed through parameters. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. The functionality is typical for API wrappers, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API client for token management in Databricks, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It appropriately handles input data and makes network requests. No security risks are evident from this fragment.",
