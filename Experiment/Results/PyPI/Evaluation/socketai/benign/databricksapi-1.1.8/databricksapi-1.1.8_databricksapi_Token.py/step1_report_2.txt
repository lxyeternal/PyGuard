  "purpose": "A class for managing tokens in a Databricks environment, including creating, listing, and revoking tokens via API calls.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'url', 'token', 'lifetime_seconds', 'comment', and 'token_id' for API requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST and GET requests to specified URLs with payloads containing token details.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL construction and payloads, which are then used in HTTP requests to the API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns detected. The class relies on external 'Databricks' module, but usage appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass 'Token' that interacts with Databricks API endpoints to create, list, and revoke tokens. It constructs URLs dynamically using class methods and sends HTTP requests with relevant data. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors, are present. The functions handle token management with straightforward parameter passing. The security relies on the underlying '_post' and '_get' methods, but within this code, there are no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intents.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for token management in Databricks. It performs standard operations without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No security threats or malware indicators are detected based on this fragment.",
