  "purpose": "API client for managing Databricks tokens: create, list, revoke.",
  "sources": "URL construction via _set_url; data passed as parameters; network requests via _post and _get.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external API endpoints; potential data transmission of tokens and IDs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (url, token, token_id, comment, lifetime_seconds) flow into URL and payload; then sent via _post/_get to API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. External methods assumed secure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper for token management, relying on inherited HTTP methods. No malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The security risk is low, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's simplicity and function. External method security is assumed but should be verified. Overall, the code appears benign and correctly implemented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious API client for token management in Databricks. No security threats or malware indicators are evident. The assigned scores are justified and appropriate.",
