  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward API wrapper for Databricks secrets and ACL management, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The minor typo should be corrected for code quality. The inherent security risk is low and typical for such API clients, primarily involving the transmission of secrets over network requests. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the typical operational risks associated with handling secrets."
