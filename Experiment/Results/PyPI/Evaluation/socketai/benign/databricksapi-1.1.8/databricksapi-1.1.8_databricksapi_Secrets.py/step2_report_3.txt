  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and applying critical thinking.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper for Databricks secrets and ACL management. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. It raises exceptions for unsupported value types.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code matches the description; it is a typical API client.\n  - No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.\n  - Sensitive data (secrets, scope, keys) are passed as parameters, which is standard.\n  - No anomalies or signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0.2 (low, typical for API wrappers)\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The report's assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the API wrapper nature, with no malicious behavior detected. Notes potential risks if malicious inputs are supplied, but this is typical.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code constructs payloads from user inputs, which could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is standard for such wrappers.\n  - No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n  - Proper exception handling for unsupported types.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0.2 (acceptable)\n\n**Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a standard API wrapper, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. Data flows are typical, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code handles secrets and ACLs via parameters, with no hardcoded secrets.\n  - No signs of malicious code or backdoors.\n  - The only concern is potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but that is outside the scope of the code itself.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0.2 (appropriate)\n\n**Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard API wrapper, no malicious intent, no obfuscation, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code is designed for legitimate secret management.\n  - No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n  - Proper handling of input parameters.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n\n**Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment—no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is a standard wrapper with low security risk.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No signs of malicious activity.\n  - No suspicious patterns.\n  - Proper use of parameters and exception handling.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Security risk: 0.2 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate. The code is a standard API wrapper, with no signs of malicious payloads or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.2, reflecting a low but inherent risk due to transmitting secrets over network requests. This is reasonable given the context.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — Slight inherent risk from transmitting secrets via API, but nothing unusual.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper for Databricks secrets management. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security issues beyond typical risks associated with API interactions involving sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2                    |\n\nThis assessment is consistent with all reports and the code review.",
