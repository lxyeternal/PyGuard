{
  "purpose": "The code manages secrets in a Databricks environment, providing functions to create, delete, list, and manage access control for secret scopes and secrets.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as scope, key, value, value_type, principal, and permission. It also uses class attributes for URL and token.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST and GET requests to the Databricks API endpoints for secret management and ACL control.",
  "flows": "User inputs (scope, key, values, permissions) are used to build API request payloads, which are sent via HTTP requests to Databricks endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated or malicious code structures. No dynamic code execution or suspicious data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a wrapper around Databricks API for secret management. It constructs payloads based on user inputs and sends them via HTTP methods. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The class methods handle various secret and ACL operations securely, with input validation for value types. The code appears straightforward and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior. The use of standard exception handling for unsupported value types is appropriate. There are no signs of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper for managing secrets in Databricks. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is low. There is no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage in this code.",
