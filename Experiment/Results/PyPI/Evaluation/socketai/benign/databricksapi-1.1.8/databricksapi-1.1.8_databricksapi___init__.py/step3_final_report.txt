  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string; no malicious intent or dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version string assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. No input, output, or dynamic code is present. The code is minimal, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the current scoring is appropriate.",
