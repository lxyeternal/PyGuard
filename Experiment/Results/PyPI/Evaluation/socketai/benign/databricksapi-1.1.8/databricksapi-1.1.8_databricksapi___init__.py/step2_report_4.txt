  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports describe the code as a straightforward assignment of the string `'1.1.7'` to the variable `__version__`. The original code snippet confirms this. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, input handling, external data interaction, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and standard for Python package version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this is a simple version assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; there's no malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is just a static version string assignment, the risk scores should remain at 0.5 or below. The current scores are consistent with this.\n\n5. **Malware Evaluation**  \nThere is no indication of malicious intent, hidden code, or suspicious behavior. The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports are based on straightforward observations without unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as a standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Score Consistency and Final Assessment**  \nThe scores are consistent and appropriate given the code's simplicity. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to acknowledge minimal risk inherent in any code snippet, but effectively negligible)\n\n**Overall, this code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.**",
