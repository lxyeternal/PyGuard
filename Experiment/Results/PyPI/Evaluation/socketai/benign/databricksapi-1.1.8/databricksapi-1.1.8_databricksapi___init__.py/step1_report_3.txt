  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as there are no inputs or data transformations.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no active behavior; only a version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string '1.1.7' to the variable __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages to specify the version number. There are no input sources, external data reads, or data processing. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is standard for a version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, typical version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
