  "purpose": "The code defines the version string of a Python package/module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as there are no processing or transfer statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a version assignment, which is standard practice and unremarkable.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '1.1.7' to the variable '__version__', a common convention for indicating package version. There are no suspicious patterns, no data input/output, no dynamic execution, or hidden behavior. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple version declaration with no malicious or security-related concerns. It poses no security risk or suspicious behavior.",
