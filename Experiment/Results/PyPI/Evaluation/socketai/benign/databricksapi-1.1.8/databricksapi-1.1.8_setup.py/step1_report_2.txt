  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package called 'databricksapi', including reading the README file and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file; package setup parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs found that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> setup configuration; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious code or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file for the long description and then configures the package setup with metadata such as name, version, description, author, URL, license, and classifiers. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network or system modification activities. The code appears standard for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It simply prepares the package for distribution.",
