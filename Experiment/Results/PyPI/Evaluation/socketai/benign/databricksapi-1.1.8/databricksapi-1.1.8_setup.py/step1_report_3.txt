  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Python package 'databricksapi' including reading a README file and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data processing; setup configuration and file reading are safe",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content flows into the 'long_description' parameter in setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads a README file with specified encoding, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata including name, version, description, author info, URL, license, and classifiers. The code is straightforward and follows standard packaging practices without any obfuscated or malicious elements. There are no input/output sources beyond reading a static file, and no suspicious sinks or flows present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
