  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'databricksapi' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, and static package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; package setup uses hardcoded strings and file input.",
  "flows": "File read for long_description -> setuptools.setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all code consists of standard setup procedures with no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated sections.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, reads 'README.md' content for the long description, and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with static metadata including package name, version, author info, URL, license, and classifiers. All inputs are static or from a file read, with no dynamic or untrusted data processing. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code follows standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely handles static data and a single file read, with no external untrusted inputs or suspicious actions.",
