  "purpose": "This code sets up the packaging configuration for a Python project named 'databricksapi', including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description, and defines package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute code dynamically.",
  "flows": "Reads file content as source, then uses it in package metadata. No data flows into insecure functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious patterns or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' to configure package metadata, reads a markdown file for the long description, and sets various package attributes. There are no indications of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The use of standard setup procedures and straightforward file reading presents no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe to use.",
