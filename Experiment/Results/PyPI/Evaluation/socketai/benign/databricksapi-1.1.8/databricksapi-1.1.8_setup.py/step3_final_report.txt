  "flows": "Reading README.md file and passing static data to setuptools.setup() without dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script that reads a local file and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input is present. All signals indicate a benign, standard package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Python packaging script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reviews correctly identify its benign nature, and scores are consistent with this assessment.",
