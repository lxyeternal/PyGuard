{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'databricksapi', including reading the README and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static data within the setup configuration (name, version, description, author, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data output or execution of external commands based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md (source) for long description, then passing static metadata to setuptools.setup() (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated structures. No hardcoded credentials or secrets present. Usage is typical for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a local README.md file for the package long description and uses setuptools to configure the package metadata. All data appears static or from a trusted local file. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, dynamic code execution, or credential handling. The setup configuration is straightforward and standard for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks. It reads local documentation and defines package metadata safely.",
