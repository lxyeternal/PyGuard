  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe provided code is a standard Python package setup script:\n- Imports `setuptools`.\n- Reads `README.md` for the long description.\n- Calls `setuptools.setup()` with static, trusted metadata (name, version, author, URL, license, classifiers).\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input processing.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hidden behaviors.\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n- The code does not contain any malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- It handles only static data and a simple file read.\n- The `README.md` file is a local file; assuming it's safe.\n- No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved.\n\n**Analysis of Reports:**\n- All five reports concur that the code is a straightforward setup script.\n- They identify no anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, because there's no security risk or vulnerability present.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The code's simplicity and static nature justify zero scores across malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the consensus in the reports.",
