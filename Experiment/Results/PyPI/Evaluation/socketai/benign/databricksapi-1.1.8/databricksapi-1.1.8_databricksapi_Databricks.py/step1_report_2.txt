{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class for interacting with Databricks API, managing tokens, and making HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'DATABRICKS_TOKEN' for authentication token; accepts token as constructor argument; reads URL inputs for API calls; reads request payloads and files for POST requests.",
  "sinks": "Uses requests library to send HTTP GET and POST requests with authentication headers; potentially exposes response content or errors.",
  "flows": "Token source (environment variable or constructor argument) flows into header construction; URL and payload inputs flow into HTTP request methods; responses are processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code. The token management appears standard. The request methods correctly handle JSON serialization and responses.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages tokens via environment variables or explicit parameters. HTTP request methods are implemented with proper headers and JSON handling. No suspicious or malicious code is evident; the methods are standard for API interaction. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The token handling uses environment variables or parameters, reducing risk. The request handling includes exception handling for JSON decode errors but no malicious data manipulation. Overall, the code appears legitimate and well-structured, with no malicious or malicious-suspected behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API client for Databricks with proper token handling and request management. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected. The overall security risk is low.",
