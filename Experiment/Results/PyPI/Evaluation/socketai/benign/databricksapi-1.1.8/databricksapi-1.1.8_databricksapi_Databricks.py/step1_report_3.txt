{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python class for interacting with Databricks API, including token management and HTTP request handling.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'DATABRICKS_TOKEN' for authentication token; accepts token as an argument during instantiation; reads URL parameters for API calls; reads request payloads and files for POST requests.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests to Databricks API endpoints with potentially untrusted payloads and files; uses environment variable and input parameters for authorization token.",
  "flows": "Token is set from environment variable or input; URL is sanitized and constructed; requests are made via _post and _get methods with data or files; responses are returned as JSON or raw content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual dynamic code execution; the token handling is appropriate but relies on environment variable presence; request methods correctly handle payloads and files; no suspicious URL patterns or data leaks evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement standard API interaction patterns with proper token handling. The token is fetched securely from environment variables or passed explicitly. Request methods use proper headers and handle JSON serialization carefully. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration routines are present. The code does not perform any dangerous operations beyond HTTP communication. The only potential concern is the reliance on environment variable 'DATABRICKS_TOKEN', which is a common practice but could be misused if the environment is compromised. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API wrapper for Databricks, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It securely manages tokens and handles HTTP requests appropriately. No security risks are identified beyond typical API client operations.",
