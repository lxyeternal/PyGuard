{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class for interacting with Databricks APIs, managing tokens, constructing URLs, and making HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DATABRICKS_TOKEN' for token retrieval, function parameters for token, URLs, payloads, and files for HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods (_post, _get) that send data over network, potential printing of response content in case of JSON decoding failure.",
  "flows": "Token retrieved from environment or input -> used in headers -> HTTP requests sent to URLs -> responses processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "The token is only sourced from environment or constructor parameter; no hardcoded secrets. Content-Type header misspelled as 'content_type' instead of 'Content-Type', potentially affecting HTTP requests but not inherently malicious. Response content printed upon JSON decode failure may expose sensitive info if server returns unexpected data. No suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves tokens from environment variables or explicit parameters, avoiding hardcoded credentials. HTTP requests are appropriately formed with headers and data payloads. The only notable issue is the misspelled 'content_type' header, which could cause request failures but does not introduce malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The response printing on JSON decode errors might expose data, but it appears intended for debugging rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client for Databricks with no evident malicious intent. The only minor concern is improper header naming which could lead to request failures, but this is not malicious. Overall, the code demonstrates legitimate functionality with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
