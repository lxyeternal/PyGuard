  "purpose": "A Python API client for Databricks, managing tokens, constructing URLs, and performing HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DATABRICKS_TOKEN' or explicit token parameter; URL parameters; request payloads and files.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request functions (requests.post, requests.get) that send data over the network; response parsing.",
  "flows": "Token retrieval from environment or parameter → URL construction → HTTP request → JSON parsing or content return.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in header 'content_type' instead of 'Content-Type'; response content printed on JSON decode error, potential info leak; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client class with token management, URL handling, and request methods. No malicious routines, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The only minor issues are the header typo and response print on decode failure, which are not malicious but could cause functional or informational concerns. The security risk is low, and the malware score is justified as zero. The code's structure and behavior are typical for such clients, with no signs of sabotage or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor header typo and response handling are non-security issues. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
