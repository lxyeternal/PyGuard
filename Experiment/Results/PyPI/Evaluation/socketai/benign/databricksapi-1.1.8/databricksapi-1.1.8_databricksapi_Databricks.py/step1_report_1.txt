{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python class for interacting with Databricks APIs, managing tokens, constructing URLs, and performing HTTP GET and POST requests.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'DATABRICKS_TOKEN' for authentication, input parameters for URLs, payloads, and files for requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests sent via 'requests.post' and 'requests.get', potentially transmitting untrusted or sensitive data over network.",
  "flows": "Token retrieved from environment or provided explicitly -> headers constructed -> URL generated -> HTTP request sent -> response processed (JSON or raw content).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code or unusual code structures observed. Usage of environment variable for token is standard. No evidence of malicious data exfiltration or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The class manages API interactions with proper token handling, URL sanitation, and flexible request methods. It includes error handling for missing tokens and JSON decoding errors. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors. The network requests are typical for API clients. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious obfuscation, or harmful behaviors. The code appears legitimate, with standard security considerations and no anomalies suggestive of supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client class for Databricks with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles tokens securely (via environment or explicit input), constructs requests properly, and does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
