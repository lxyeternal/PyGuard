  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a legitimate API wrapper for Databricks, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, aligning with the assessments.\n- Minor typos (e.g., \"email_notications\" and \"ClusterTypeNotSupportedExpcetion\") are noted but do not suggest malicious intent.\n- The code relies on external methods (_post, _get) whose implementations are not provided; the security of data transmission depends on these.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issues:\n- **Code presence:** All reports accurately describe the code structure and functions.\n- **Issues in logic or reasoning:** No report indicates that the code contains logic flaws that could lead to vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the misspelling of exception class names and parameter names, which does not impact security.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 across all reports, justified by the absence of malicious code.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n  - Security risk: 0.2, which is reasonable given the code's purpose and the reliance on external network methods.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code. The assessments correctly avoid speculative claims.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Risk scores > 0.5:** None assigned; appropriate.\n- **Malware scores:** Correctly set to 0, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly 0.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal concern about data transmission security depending on external methods, which is appropriate.\n\n### Challenges and Recommendations:\n- The reports could mention that the security of data in transit depends on the implementation of `_post` and `_get`. If these methods are insecure, that could introduce vulnerabilities, but based on the code provided, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- The typo in class names (\"Expcetion\") is minor but indicates potential code quality issues rather than maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (minimal, mostly due to external method dependencies and minor typos)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, standard API wrapper for managing Databricks jobs. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is low but slightly above zero due to external dependencies and minor code quality issues.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the assessments provided and is justified by the code's transparent and purpose-driven nature.",
