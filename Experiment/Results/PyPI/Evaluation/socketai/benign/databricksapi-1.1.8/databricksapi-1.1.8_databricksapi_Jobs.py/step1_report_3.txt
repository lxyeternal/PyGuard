  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface for managing Databricks jobs via API, including creating, listing, deleting, resetting, running, and retrieving job information.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as URL, token, job IDs, cluster configurations, task details, and optional parameters passed to various methods.",
  "sinks": "API request payloads sent via POST/GET methods, which include job configurations, IDs, and parameters, used to control and manage Databricks jobs.",
  "flows": "Input data from method parameters flows into payload dictionaries, which are then sent via network requests to Databricks API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code performs standard API interaction with no obfuscated or unusual constructs. Exception handling is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured API client for Databricks, handling job management tasks with clear input validation and parameter handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code does not execute untrusted data or perform dangerous system operations. All inputs are used to construct API payloads with no evident security issues or malicious intent. No obfuscated code or malware-like activities are present. The code appears to be a legitimate interface for interacting with Databricks, with proper exception handling for unsupported types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate API client for managing Databricks jobs. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The structure is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious behavior. It appears safe and purpose-driven for job management.",
