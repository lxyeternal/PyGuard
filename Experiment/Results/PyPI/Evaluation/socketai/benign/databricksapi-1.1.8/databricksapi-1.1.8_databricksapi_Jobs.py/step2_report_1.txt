  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard API client for Databricks job management.\n- No reports identify hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.\n- Minor typos (e.g., 'email_notications' and 'ClusterTypeNotSupportedExpcetion') are noted but do not suggest malicious intent.\n- The code relies on inherited methods (_post, _get) whose implementations are not provided; the security of data in transit depends on these.\n- No evidence of code injection, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity is found.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports or the code snippets suggest malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Input validation:** Proper validation of cluster_type, task_type, run_type, with exception handling for unsupported types.\n- **Potential misconfigurations:** Misspellings (e.g., 'email_notications') could lead to misbehavior but not malicious activity.\n- **Security concerns:** The code does not handle secrets internally; external methods (_post, _get) are not shown, which could be a risk if insecure.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscated patterns, or backdoors are present.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain **0**.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and readable.\n- Minor typos are present but do not constitute obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper with standard validation.\n- The main concern is the reliance on external methods (_post, _get) whose security depends on their implementation.\n- No hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n- Minor code quality issues (typos) do not increase risk.\n- **Conclusion:** The security risk is minimal; a score of **0.2** seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.2**\n\nThese scores are consistent with the reports' findings and the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports' confidence levels (0.9) are high, indicating a strong consensus that the code is benign.\n- The minimal security risk score reflects the need to trust the underlying network methods (_post, _get), but in the absence of evidence, the risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a legitimate, straightforward API client for Databricks with no malicious or obfuscated features.\n- The overall security posture is very low risk, with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a slight risk score of 0.2 for external dependencies and potential misconfigurations.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as is unless further internal method implementations reveal vulnerabilities.",
