  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a wrapper for Databricks API, managing jobs and runs.\n- Input data flows from method parameters into payloads, then sent via _post/_get.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code relies on inherited methods (_post, _get) whose implementations are not provided; their security is critical but cannot be assessed here.\n- Minor typos (e.g., 'email_notications', 'Expcetion') are present but do not impact security.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Concerns:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports primarily describe standard API wrapper behavior with no malicious activity. The only potential issues are minor typos and reliance on external methods.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic?**  \n  - Typo in class name: `ClusterTypeNotSupportedExpcetion` should be `ClusterTypeNotSupportedException`. This is a minor code quality issue, not a security flaw.\n  - Typo in 'email_notications'—should be 'email_notifications'. This could cause misconfiguration but not a security risk.\n  - The methods `deleteAllJobs` and `mapJobNames` are unimplemented; not a security concern but indicates incomplete code.\n\n- **Scores and their reasonableness:**\n  - All reports assign malware score = 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n  - Obfuscated score = 0, which is correct.\n  - Security risk scores are around 0.2, reflecting minimal concerns about API misuse or data handling, which is reasonable.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which aligns with the code's apparent benign nature.\n\n- **Malware scores?**  \n  Correctly set to 0 across reports; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports avoid assumptions about the behavior of `_post` and `_get`. They acknowledge that security depends on their implementation, which is prudent.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The code does not execute untrusted code, perform system operations, or handle secrets internally.\n- The only potential concern is the external HTTP methods, but without their implementation, we cannot conclude any malicious activity.\n- The minor typos do not impact security but suggest a need for code quality improvements.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested value |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| malware            | 0               |\n| obfuscated         | 0               |\n| securityRisk       | 0.2             |\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- No malware or obfuscation detected.\n- The code is a straightforward API wrapper with standard validation.\n- The minimal security risk score accounts for the reliance on external HTTP methods and minor code quality issues, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code appears legitimate, purpose-driven, and free of malicious behavior.\n- The main security considerations depend on the implementation of `_post` and `_get`, which are not shown.\n- Minor typos should be corrected for code quality but do not pose security issues.\n- No changes are necessary to the reported scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores, with an emphasis on reviewing the implementation of `_post` and `_get` for any security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the underlying HTTP methods are secure, handle data appropriately, and do not introduce vulnerabilities.",
