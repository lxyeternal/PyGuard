  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a wrapper for Databricks API, handling job management functions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code relies on inherited methods (_post, _get) whose implementations are not provided; security of network communication depends on those.\n- Minor typos (e.g., 'email_notications' and 'Expcetion') are present but do not imply malicious intent.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious data flow is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues such as code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident.\n- **Error in logic or reasoning:** Minor typos are present but are not critical security flaws.\n- **Underlying methods (_post, _get):** Since their implementation is unknown, the security depends on their correctness. If these methods are secure, the overall code is likely safe.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- No evidence suggests malicious activity, so a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- No obfuscation detected.\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- The reports assign a low risk score (~0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's purpose and the lack of malicious activity.\n- The only concern is the reliance on external methods (_post, _get). If these are insecure, risks could increase, but based on the code provided, this is speculative.\n- Therefore, a risk score of around 0.2–0.3 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- **The core logic is sound and aligns with standard API wrapper patterns.**\n- **No malicious intent or suspicious activity is evident.**\n- **Potential vulnerabilities depend on external method implementations, which are not part of this code snippet.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 (low, based on code quality and validation)\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Ensure that the inherited methods (_post, _get) are implemented securely.\n- Correct minor typos to improve code quality.\n- Consider adding input validation or sanitization if user inputs are untrusted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears legitimate, purpose-driven, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores are appropriate, but if external methods are insecure, the risk could be higher. Given the information, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.",
