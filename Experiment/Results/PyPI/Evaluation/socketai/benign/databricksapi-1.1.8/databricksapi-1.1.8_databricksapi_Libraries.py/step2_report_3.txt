  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward API wrapper class for Databricks, handling cluster status and library management via HTTP GET and POST requests.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- Input parameters are passed externally, and the code constructs URLs and payloads accordingly.\n- The code does not perform any data processing beyond request formation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected.\n- The code relies on inherited methods (_get, _post, _set_url) whose implementations are not shown but are presumed standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code issues:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. The code appears correct and standard for an API client wrapper. No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or anomalies are evident.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n\n- The reports are consistent; they recognize the code as a standard API wrapper with no malicious intent.\n- They correctly identify the absence of obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behavior.\n- No logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.2 or 0, which is low and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The security risk scores are slightly above zero (0.2). Given the code's benign nature, these could be lowered to 0 unless other context (not provided) suggests risk.\n- The malware scores should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- If any were, we would need to justify based on malicious activity, secrets, or vulnerabilities, which are absent here.\n\n### Consistency with malware score:\n\n- All reports correctly assign malware as 0, matching the code's harmless appearance.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper for Databricks with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
