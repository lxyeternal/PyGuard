  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the associated code carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward API wrapper class for Databricks, handling cluster statuses and library management.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are mentioned.\n- The code appears to be a standard implementation, with input parameters used to construct URLs and payloads for HTTP requests.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution are detected.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.2), which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical assessments:\n\n**1. Code presence of malicious activity?**  \n- The code is a typical API client wrapper, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious URL patterns are present.\n- The methods simply prepare and send requests based on provided parameters.\n\n**2. Are the reported issues present?**  \n- The reports do not identify any issues or vulnerabilities.  \n- They correctly conclude the code is benign and straightforward.\n\n**3. Are the scores appropriate?**  \n- Malware score: 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated: 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n- Security risk: 0.2, a cautious but reasonable score for code that handles potentially sensitive data (like tokens and cluster IDs) but does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n\n**4. Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?**  \n- The scores seem consistent with the reports' assessments.  \n- The risk score of 0.2 is slightly conservative but acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- **No actual vulnerabilities or malicious code are detected.**  \n- The code relies on external inputs for URL, token, cluster IDs, and libraries, which should be validated elsewhere, but that is outside the scope of this review.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected, no malicious activity suspected).  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present).  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is appropriate given the potential exposure of sensitive parameters, but the code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with reports and analysis)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent. The current scores are reasonable and justified.",
