{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for managing Databricks libraries and cluster statuses via API calls.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'url', 'token', 'cluster_id', and 'libraries'.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods '_get' and '_post' which send data to external endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input data (url, token, cluster_id, libraries) flows into URL construction and payloads, which are then sent via network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The class inherits from a Databricks base class and constructs API URLs for various library management functions. It properly encapsulates parameters and makes standard API calls with payloads. No hardcoded credentials are visible; input parameters are passed externally. The code does not include any data processing beyond request formation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The methods are straightforward wrappers around API endpoints.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client wrapper for Databricks library management without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It functions as expected for its purpose. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling detected.",
