  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a class `Libraries` inheriting from a base `Databricks` class.\n- It provides methods to:\n  - Retrieve all cluster statuses (`allClusterStatuses`)\n  - Retrieve specific cluster status (`clusterStatus`)\n  - Install libraries (`installLibrary`)\n  - Uninstall libraries (`uninstallLibrary`)\n- It constructs URLs dynamically, passes parameters via payloads, and makes HTTP requests using inherited methods `_get` and `_post`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are visible.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward API wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Concerns:\n\n**Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code appears correct and functional; no signs of bugs, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The URL construction and payload formation follow standard practices.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is a legitimate API wrapper with no malicious intent.\n- They do not identify any logical errors or security flaws.\n- They correctly note the absence of obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Scores Review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0.2 or 0, indicating low risk\n- These scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2.\n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n**Malware Score Justification:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n**Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n- The code relies on external inputs (`url`, `token`, `cluster_id`, `libraries`, `status`) which, if maliciously crafted, could cause issues, but this is typical for API wrappers.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities like injection or data exfiltration is present.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable assignments are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, standard API wrapper)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured API client for managing Databricks libraries and cluster statuses.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe based on the provided analysis.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- Always ensure input validation at higher levels.\n- Confirm that the parent `Databricks` class handles secure URL and token management properly.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scoring accurately reflects this.",
