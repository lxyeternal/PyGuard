  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward API wrapper class for Databricks, inheriting from a base class, with methods to get cluster statuses, install, and uninstall libraries.\n- All reports agree that the code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The inputs are parameters passed externally, and the methods form URLs and payloads for API calls.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration is detected.\n- The code's purpose appears to be legitimate and standard for API interaction.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n**Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n\n- The code appears syntactically correct and logically consistent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution.\n- The API calls seem standard; the class simply wraps API endpoints with provided parameters.\n\n**Errors or flaws:**\n\n- The report mentions that the code \"does not include any data processing beyond request formation,\" which is accurate.\n- No issues are evident in the code logic or structure.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n\n**Malware score:**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n\n- All reports assign 0, which is justified; no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Security risk score:**\n\n- The reports assign a low risk (~0.2), which seems reasonable.\n- The code handles sensitive parameters like tokens and URLs, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The risk arises from external inputs, but this is typical for such API wrappers.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities without evidence. They note that the code relies on external inputs and standard API calls, which is expected.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is justified.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Consistently 0, justified by the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (as per reports, justified by external input handling and API interaction)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a legitimate API wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is appropriate, considering the reliance on external inputs but no evident malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2            |\n\nThis aligns with the consensus that the code is benign, well-structured, and intended for legitimate API interaction.",
