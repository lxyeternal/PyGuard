{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class for interacting with Databricks libraries API, enabling installation, uninstallation, and status checks of libraries on clusters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as url, token, cluster_id, libraries, and status; class instantiation; method parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET and POST requests to specified URLs with payloads containing cluster IDs and libraries.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct URLs and payloads, which are then sent via HTTP methods to remote endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code constructs; straightforward API wrapper implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of a Databricks API wrapper with methods to fetch cluster statuses, install, and uninstall libraries. It constructs URLs and payloads based on input parameters and makes HTTP requests via inherited methods. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious data handling observed. The code appears to serve as a simple API client for managing Databricks clusters and libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard API client wrapper for Databricks library management. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or malicious code. It is a legitimate implementation of an API interaction class with no apparent security risks or malware indicators.",
