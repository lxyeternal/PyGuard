{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for managing Databricks libraries and cluster statuses via API calls.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as url, token, cluster_id, libraries, and status; data from API responses",
  "sinks": "Potential API request URLs, payloads containing sensitive information, and responses from API calls",
  "flows": "Initialization takes URL and token; methods construct API URLs and send GET/POST requests with parameters; data flows from input parameters to API calls",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code uses straightforward API interactions. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The class extends a Databricks base class, defining methods to interact with Databricks APIs for cluster status and library management. It constructs URLs using provided parameters, assembles payloads with cluster IDs and libraries, and performs GET or POST requests. There are no indications of malicious payloads, hidden code, or suspicious behaviors. All code appears to be standard API wrapper logic, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious data flows. The code is well-structured and lacks anomalies such as dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper for Databricks cluster and library management. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. No malware or security concerns are evident.",
