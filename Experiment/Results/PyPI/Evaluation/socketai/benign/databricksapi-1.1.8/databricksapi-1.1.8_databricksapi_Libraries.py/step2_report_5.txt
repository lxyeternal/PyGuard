  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code snippets are consistent across reports: a class wrapping API calls to Databricks for cluster and library management.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs are identified.\n- The methods are straightforward wrappers, with URL construction and HTTP requests.\n- The inputs are parameters, and the code relies on inherited methods `_get`, `_post`, and `_set_url`, which are presumed standard.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malware or obfuscation. Security risk is low, given the code's purpose and structure.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a simple API wrapper, with no malicious indicators.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior. Security risk is low; the code handles potentially sensitive data but does so in a standard manner.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malware or obfuscation; the code is a straightforward API client.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Score: malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0**\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior. The security risk is low, assuming proper input validation elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: Adjustments and Justification\n- All reports have malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are consistently low (0.2), justified by the fact that the code handles external inputs and performs network requests, but nothing suspicious is present.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity or code obfuscation is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minimal security concerns primarily due to external data handling, but no significant vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's analysis.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, straightforward API wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The overall assessment aligns with a very low security risk, no malware, and no obfuscation.",
