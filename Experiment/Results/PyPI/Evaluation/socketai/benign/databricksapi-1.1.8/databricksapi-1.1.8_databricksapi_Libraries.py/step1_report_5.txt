{
  "purpose": "A wrapper class for interacting with Databricks libraries API to manage cluster libraries.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'url', 'token', 'cluster_id', and 'libraries' parameters supplied to class methods.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET and POST requests constructed with URL and payload; potentially sensitive data could be included in these requests.",
  "flows": "Constructor receives URL and token; methods build URLs and send requests with cluster IDs, library data, or status info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or unusual code structures detected. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The class extends a Databricks module, providing methods to retrieve cluster statuses and install/uninstall libraries via API calls. Inputs are provided through method parameters, and requests are formed accordingly. The code appears straightforward, using standard API request patterns. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is evident. The class depends on the parent Databricks class for HTTP methods and URL setup, which is not shown but presumed standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard API wrapper for Databricks library management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles data and URL construction securely, assuming proper implementation of parent class methods.",
