  "purpose": "API wrapper class for managing Databricks cluster statuses and libraries, providing methods to retrieve statuses, install, and uninstall libraries via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as url, token, cluster_id, libraries, status; URL construction via _set_url; payloads for _get and _post methods.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods (_get, _post) sending data to external API endpoints; no direct untrusted data sinks within the code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL construction and payloads, which are then sent via HTTP requests to the API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution; straightforward API wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client class that constructs URLs and payloads based on input parameters and makes HTTP requests. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The methods are simple wrappers around API endpoints, relying on inherited request methods. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The security implications are minimal, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper for Databricks cluster and library management, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The low security risk score is appropriate given its functionality. The assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
