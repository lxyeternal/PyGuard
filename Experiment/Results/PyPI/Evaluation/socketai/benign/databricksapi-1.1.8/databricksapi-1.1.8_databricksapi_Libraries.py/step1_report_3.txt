{
  "purpose": "A class that manages Databricks library operations such as retrieving cluster statuses and installing or uninstalling libraries via API calls.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'url', 'token', 'cluster_id', and 'libraries'; method parameters for API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET and POST requests to constructed URLs with payloads containing potentially untrusted data.",
  "flows": "User-supplied 'cluster_id', 'libraries', 'url', and 'token' are used in constructing API request URLs and payloads for network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that extends a Databricks class, providing methods for cluster status retrieval and library management via API requests. It constructs URLs dynamically and sends HTTP requests with supplied parameters. No untrusted data handling issues or malicious behaviors are evident. The use of parameters for API interaction appears standard and expected. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious payloads. The code structure is straightforward and functional, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper for Databricks library management. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is low, assuming the inputs are validated appropriately elsewhere.",
