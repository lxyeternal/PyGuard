  "sinks": "Logging output to the console via StreamHandler",
  "flows": "Logger initialization -> Handler creation -> Formatter setup -> Handler addition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears standard for logging setup",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger based on the module name, checks if handlers exist, and if not, creates a StreamHandler with DEBUG level and a simple formatter. This is typical for setting up logging in Python applications. No untrusted input is processed, and no suspicious behavior or malicious code is present. The code does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or sensitive data access. It is a standard logging configuration snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logger setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions to ensure logging output is configured properly.",
