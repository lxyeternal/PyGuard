{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a logger and defines a function to set up a console log handler if none exists.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name via __name__ to configure the logger.",
  "sinks": "The logger outputs to the console through a StreamHandler; no untrusted input is directly processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to dangerous sinks. The function sets up logging configuration internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The logger setup is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module and creates a logger based on the module name prefix. The function _check_log_handler() checks if handlers are attached to this logger; if not, it creates a console handler with DEBUG level, sets a formatter, and attaches it to the logger. The code is straightforward, with no external input processing or risky operations. It appears to be a typical logging setup without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging configuration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up console logging if not already configured.",
