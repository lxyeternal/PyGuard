  "purpose": "Configure a logger with a console handler if none exists",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's __name__ to set up the logger, and creates a StreamHandler for logging output",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or inputs are used that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "The logger is configured to output messages to the console, but no external input or data flows are involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard logging setup procedures without suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger based on the module name and defines a function to add a console handler if none exist. The function is straightforward, creating a StreamHandler with DEBUG level and a simple formatter, then attaches it to the logger. No user input, external data, or dynamic execution is present. The logic is typical for setting up logging in a Python application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks.",
