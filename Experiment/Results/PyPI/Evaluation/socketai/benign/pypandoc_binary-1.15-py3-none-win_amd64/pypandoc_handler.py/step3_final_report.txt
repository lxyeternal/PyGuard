  "purpose": "Configure a logger with a console handler if none exists to facilitate debugging and informational output.",
  "sources": "The code reads the logger's existing handlers via 'logger.handlers'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Checks 'logger.handlers' as source; if empty, adds a StreamHandler as sink, configuring it with a formatter.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard logging setup patterns. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger based on '__name__', checks if handlers are attached, and adds a console StreamHandler with a formatter if none exist. It involves no external inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive operations. The code is a typical logging setup snippet, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe logging configuration snippet with no malicious or security concerns. The reports accurately assess its benign nature, and the scores are justified. No further action is required.",
