  "purpose": "A utility wrapper for Pandoc, managing version detection, path resolution, subprocess execution, and format validation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for locating Pandoc, file paths, user input strings, and subprocess outputs.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing Pandoc with user-controlled arguments, environment variables, and file paths.",
  "flows": "User inputs and environment variables influence subprocess invocation; subprocess output is processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Environment variables are manipulated in a standard manner.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured utility for managing Pandoc invocation, including version checks, environment setup, and format validation. It handles subprocess execution responsibly with error handling and validation. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or network activity are present. The environment variable manipulations and subprocess calls are standard for such utilities, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard wrapper for Pandoc, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It follows best practices for subprocess management and environment handling, and no obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
