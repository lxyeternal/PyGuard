  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding, decoding, and URL/path conversions with compatibility across Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Locale settings, sys module, and URL/path functions that process file paths and strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential string conversions and URL/path parsing functions which could handle untrusted input if misused.",
  "flows": "Input data from locale, sys, and URL functions pass through encoding/decoding and path/url conversion functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard library functions for encoding and URL handling without any obfuscated or malicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides compatibility wrappers for string encoding, decoding, and URL/path conversions across Python versions. It uses standard library functions and handles exceptions carefully. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and appears to be intended for safe utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of compatibility and utility functions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks, and it appears safe for use.",
