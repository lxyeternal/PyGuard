  "sources": "locale.getpreferredencoding(), sys.getdefaultencoding(), standard library modules (urllib, urlparse, urllib.pathname2url, url2pathname)",
  "sinks": "Encoding and decoding functions, URL/path conversion functions",
  "flows": "Input data (system locale, sys default encoding) -> encoding/decoding functions -> URL/path functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, licensed, and standard for compatibility purposes",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility utility for string encoding/decoding and URL/path conversions across Python versions. It uses standard library modules with exception handling for locale encoding. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The functions handle data safely, relying on well-known modules. No external network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are detected. The code is licensed under BSD, indicating permissive use. Overall, it is benign, utility-focused code with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks and is safe for use.",
