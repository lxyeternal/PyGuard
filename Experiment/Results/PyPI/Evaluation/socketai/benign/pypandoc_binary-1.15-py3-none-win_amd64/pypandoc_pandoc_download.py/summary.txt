  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate installer utility for Pandoc binaries, with no evidence of malicious intent. The primary security risk stems from missing validation of downloads and lack of input sanitization, which could be exploited in supply chain attacks. Overall, the code is safe but would benefit from implementing checksum verification and input validation."
