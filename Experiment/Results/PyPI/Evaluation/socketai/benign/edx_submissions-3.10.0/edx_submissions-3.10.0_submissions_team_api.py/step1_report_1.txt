{
  "purpose": "Provides an API interface for creating and managing team submissions, including individual submission creation, scoring, and data retrieval in a course assessment system.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters, database queries (Submission and TeamSubmission models), and external API calls (_api.create_submission, _api.set_score, _api.reset_score).",
  "sinks": "Database writes (creating submissions, updating scores, soft-deleting submissions), external API calls for creating submissions and setting/resetting scores.",
  "flows": "Input data (parameters, database query results) flow into database and API functions which create or modify submission records, then serialize and return data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious dynamic code execution, and no hidden backdoors observed. The code mainly performs CRUD operations with validation and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code manages team submission creation, individual submission generation, and score setting with proper validation, error handling, and logging. It interacts with the database for retrieving submissions and teams, and calls external API functions for creating individual submissions and scoring. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious external domain access, or malicious logic like data exfiltration, reverse shells, or unauthorized system modifications are present. The functions appear to be straightforward API handlers for a course management system, with a focus on data integrity and proper error handling. Overall, the code performs expected functions in a secure manner without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API for managing team and individual submissions within an educational platform. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It relies on external API calls for submission creation and scoring, which should be verified separately for security. Overall, the code maintains data integrity and security best practices without any malicious or suspicious activity.",
