{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API for creating and managing team submissions, including creating submissions, retrieving submissions, setting scores, and resetting scores, primarily in an educational context.",
  "sources": "Input data includes function parameters such as course_id, item_id, team_id, submitting_user_id, team_member_ids, answer, submitted_at, attempt_number, item_type, and UUIDs from database queries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include database operations (creating and updating submission records), API calls (_api.create_submission, _api.set_score, _api.reset_score), and logging functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs through validation, database queries, and serializer operations, then to API calls that could modify system state or data, and finally to logging. For example, create_submission_for_team takes parameters, validates via serializer, creates team submission, and creates individual submissions via API; set_score retrieves a team submission, then calls _api.set_score on its child submissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URL connections are present. The code appears standard for a Django-based system. The only notable comment is the placeholder logic regarding attempt_number, but this is benign. There is exception handling for database errors and general exceptions during submission creation, which is typical and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django API implementation for handling team submissions, with operations for creation, retrieval, scoring, and resetting scores. It utilizes serializers and models appropriately, with exception handling for database errors. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The API functions rely on existing system components (_api, models, serializers) and perform expected data operations. The only minor concern is the comment about attempt_number being fixed to 1, but this does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code performs expected functionality for a team submission system without malicious behaviors or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a team submission API in a Django application, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles submissions and scores securely and efficiently, with appropriate error handling and logging. No suspicious or malicious actions are evident.",
