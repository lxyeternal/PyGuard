  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details, potential issues, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes an API for team submissions, reads data from parameters, models, and external API calls.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. It performs CRUD operations with validation and error handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard, secure-looking code with high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0 aligns with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, and no malicious activity is evident. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, describes submission management.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation. Exception handling is standard. Slight concern about reliance on external APIs, but no malicious intent observed.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid implementation, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar API functions with database and external API interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** Broad exception handling could mask errors but not malicious activity. External API reliance is noted, which could be risky if those APIs are malicious, but within this code, no malicious code is present.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of sabotage or malicious code; reliance on external APIs is a potential risk vector but not malicious per se.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, which seems appropriate given external API dependency.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are reasonable; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions for submission and scoring.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation. No backdoors. External API calls are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; scores are consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard submission management.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. External API calls are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; scores are consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify actual code issues or malicious activity.\n- **Logical Flaws or Mistakes:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Scores Justification:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code. Security risk scores are low, reflecting reliance on external APIs but no direct malicious activity.\n- **Potential Assumptions:** Some reports mention external API reliance as a potential risk, which is valid, but not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent across reports; no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, mainly due to external API reliance, but not malicious)\n\n**My Reasoned Conclusion:**\n\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a team submission API within an educational platform.\n- No malicious activity, sabotage, or backdoors are evident.\n- The reliance on external APIs warrants attention but does not constitute malware.\n- The overall security posture is high, with minimal risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- Maintain current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1–0.2.\n- Continue monitoring external API trustworthiness.\n- No immediate security concerns based on this code segment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** ~0.15 (average of the reports)  \n\nThe code is safe, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated activity.",
