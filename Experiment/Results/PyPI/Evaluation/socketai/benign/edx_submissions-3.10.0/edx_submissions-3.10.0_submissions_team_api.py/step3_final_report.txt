{
  "purpose": "Provides an API for managing team submissions, including creation, retrieval, scoring, and resetting scores within an educational platform.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters, database models (Submission, TeamSubmission), and external API calls (_api.* functions).",
  "sinks": "External API functions (_api.create_submission, _api.set_score, _api.reset_score) that could potentially send data externally or perform actions affecting system state.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and data from models flow into API functions and serializers; external API calls are invoked with relevant identifiers; data is serialized and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed. Exception handling is broad but standard; reliance on external APIs is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a submission management API with proper validation, error handling, and database interactions. No malicious logic or backdoors are present. External API calls are potential points of concern if those dependencies are compromised, but within this code, they are used appropriately. No obfuscation or suspicious activity detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API for handling team submissions with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. External API reliance warrants trust but does not constitute malicious intent. The low risk scores are justified, and malware/obfuscation scores are accurate.",
