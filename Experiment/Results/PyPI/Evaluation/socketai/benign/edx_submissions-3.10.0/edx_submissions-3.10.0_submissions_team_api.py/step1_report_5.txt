{
  "purpose": "The code provides an API interface for managing team submissions, including creation, retrieval, scoring, and resetting scores within a learning management system or assessment platform.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (e.g., course_id, item_id, team_id, submitting_user_id, team_member_ids, answer, submitted_at, attempt_number, item_type, team_submission_uuid, points_earned, points_possible, annotation_creator, annotation_type, annotation_reason). Data retrieval from database queries (e.g., Submission.objects.filter, TeamSubmission.get_team_submission_by_uuid).",
  "sinks": "Database write operations (saving TeamSubmission, Submission records, updating status). External API calls (_api.create_submission, _api.set_score, _api.reset_score) which may modify system or user data. Logging functions for audit purposes.",
  "flows": "Input data (sources) flow into validation and serialization steps, then into database creation or retrieval, followed by external API calls for individual submission creation and score setting. Data retrieval functions extract data from the database to inform logic. External API functions modify system data, potentially affecting user or system state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs observed. No backdoors or hidden behaviors detected. The code appears to follow typical patterns for database and API interaction. Exception handling is present for database errors and exceptions from external API calls, with logging for auditing.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically manages team submission data, validating input, creating records, and updating scores. It interfaces with external APIs for submission creation and scoring, which could potentially be malicious if those APIs are compromised, but within this code, calls appear legitimate. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. External API calls are properly encapsulated and exceptions are handled. The code does not include any obfuscated logic or suspicious behaviors; it appears to be a standard implementation for an LMS assessment module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API implementation for managing team submissions and scores. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks is present within this code segment. It relies on external APIs and database models that, if compromised, could pose risks, but the code itself appears safe and legitimate.",
