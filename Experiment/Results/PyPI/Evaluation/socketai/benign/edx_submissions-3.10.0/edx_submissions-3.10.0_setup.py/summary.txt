  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup utility with minimal security concerns. The primary potential issue is the use of os.system() for tagging based on command-line input, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. However, in controlled environments, this risk is negligible. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The overall security risk is low, and the code is safe for use with standard precautions."
