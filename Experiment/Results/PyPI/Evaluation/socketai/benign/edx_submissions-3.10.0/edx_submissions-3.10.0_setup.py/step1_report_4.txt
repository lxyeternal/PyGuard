  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package named 'edx-submissions', managing requirements, version extraction, and package configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package requirement files ('requirements/base.in', 'requirements/test.in'), version file ('submissions/__init__.py'), and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system to run git commands for tagging and pushing versions.",
  "flows": "Requirement files -> load_requirements() -> setup() configuration; Version file -> get_version() -> setup(); Command-line args -> os.system calls for git tagging.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system for git tagging could be exploited if the command-line arguments are manipulated, but it is a standard practice for release automation. No other anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup activities, including loading requirements, extracting version info, and optionally tagging a git release. Requirements are loaded with checks to prevent inconsistent package naming. The version is parsed from a specific file. The use of os.system for git tagging is a potential risk if command-line input is manipulated, but it appears to be straightforward and controlled within the script. No malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation is detected. Overall, the script functions as a typical setup script with no evident security threats.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with routine requirement handling and version management. The use of os.system for git commands warrants caution but is not inherently malicious. No malware or malicious behaviors are identified. The overall security risk is very low.",
