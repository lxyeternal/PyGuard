  "purpose": "The script is a setup utility for the 'edx-submissions' Python package, handling dependency parsing, version extraction, and optional git tagging.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for 'tag' command, reads requirements files, reads version info from a source file.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system() to execute 'git tag' and 'git push' commands based on command-line input.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument 'tag' triggers os.system() calls; version info is used in tagging commands; requirements are parsed from files.",
  "anomalies": "Potential command injection risk via os.system() if command-line arguments are manipulated, but inputs are limited and controlled in typical usage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: dependency parsing, version extraction, and optional tagging. The only noteworthy risk is the use of os.system() with command-line arguments, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The version info is sourced internally, and requirements are parsed with validation. The risk scores assigned in the reports (around 0.2) are appropriate given the minimal exposure. The malware score remains 0, as no malicious payloads or behaviors are detected. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward and well-commented.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup utility with minimal security concerns. The primary potential issue is the use of os.system() for tagging based on command-line input, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. However, in controlled environments, this risk is negligible. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The overall security risk is low, and the code is safe for use with standard precautions.",
