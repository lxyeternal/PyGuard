  "purpose": "Define Django database migrations for creating the TeamSubmission model and adding a foreign key to Submission.",
  "sources": "Import statements for uuid, django models, utils, and settings; model field definitions; migration dependencies and operations.",
  "sinks": "Database schema creation and modification; no direct data sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "Migration code defines data flow from model definitions to database schema changes; no untrusted input flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The use of standard Django and model_utils fields appears normal. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django migration script generating models and fields for managing team submissions. It uses common practices such as UUIDs, timezone-aware timestamps, foreign keys with SET_NULL on delete, and choices for status. No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors is present. The code appears to be part of a typical web application backend, with no suspicious logic or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate Django migration defining data models for submissions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard practices without any malicious or anomalous elements.",
