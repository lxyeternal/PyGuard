{
  "purpose": "This migration code defines database models and relationships for managing team submissions within a Django application.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration settings (settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL), generates UUIDs, timestamps (django.utils.timezone.now), and reads migration dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent externally or stored insecurely; the code primarily creates database models and fields.",
  "flows": "Input from settings and timezone functions are used to set default values; no untrusted data flows directly from external sources or into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials or hidden code present. The code uses standard Django and third-party libraries for ORM modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django migration script that creates a model 'TeamSubmission' with various fields including UUID, timestamps, and foreign keys to user models. It defines field defaults, indexes, and choices with no indication of malicious or unusual behavior. No external data input is processed dynamically at runtime; all defaults are safe, standard, and statically defined. Relationships and options follow common patterns for Django ORM models. No suspicious code, data leakage, or malicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django migration script for database schema definition. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
