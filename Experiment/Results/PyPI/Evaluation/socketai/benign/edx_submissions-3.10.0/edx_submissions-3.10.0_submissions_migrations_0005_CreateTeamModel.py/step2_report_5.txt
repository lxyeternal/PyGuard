  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Creates a `TeamSubmission` model with fields: `id`, `created`, `modified`, `uuid`, `attempt_number`, `submitted_at`, `course_id`, `item_id`, `team_id`, `status`, `submitted_by`.\n- Uses standard Django ORM features, including `UUIDField`, timestamp fields with default `django.utils.timezone.now`, foreign keys with `SET_NULL` on delete, and choices for `status`.\n- Adds a foreign key `team_submission` to an existing `Submission` model.\n- No external data input, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All consistently describe the code as a standard Django migration script.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n- The code relies solely on standard Django practices, third-party libraries (`model_utils`), and safe defaults.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The code matches the description: standard Django migration creating models with typical fields, no suspicious logic, no external data flows, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and safe.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  - `malware`: all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n  - `securityRisk`: all 0, appropriate given the benign nature.\n  - `obfuscated`: all 0, matches the code's clarity.\n  - `risk`: all 0 or very low, appropriate.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  None of the reports justify higher scores; they correctly assign zero risk.\n\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  Correctly 0, no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their conclusions on code inspection, with no unwarranted assumptions.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with content:**  \n  Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions: **the code is a typical, safe Django migration script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.** \n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, since it's just a migration script, but I keep it slightly above zero for completeness)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.**",
