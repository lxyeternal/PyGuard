{
  "purpose": "This code defines Django migration for creating a 'TeamSubmission' model and linking it to an existing 'Submission' model, primarily for database schema setup.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data read sources; relies on Django ORM and migration framework, using model fields and default functions.",
  "sinks": "Database operations and model field defaults, no untrusted data handling or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A — purely schema definition; no data flow or user input processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors; standard Django migration code structure with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up Django models and migration operations. It uses UUIDs, timezone-aware timestamps, foreign keys, and choices for status. All practices align with normal Django schema migrations; no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django migration script for database schema creation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It primarily manages database models and fields with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
