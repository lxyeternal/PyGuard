  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports systematically.\n\n**1. Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a Django migration script creating a `TeamSubmission` model and linking it to an existing `Submission` model.\n- It uses standard Django ORM features: UUIDs, timestamps, foreign keys, choices, and default values.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- No external data sources or user inputs are processed at runtime; defaults are static or generated via standard functions (`uuid.uuid4`, `django.utils.timezone.now`).\n- The migration dependencies and operations follow typical Django practices.\n\n**2. Issues and Risks:**\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected. The code is standard for Django schema migrations.\n- **Security Risks:** None apparent. No hardcoded secrets, no external data handling, no code injection points.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** None identified. The code does not process untrusted input, nor does it perform any runtime logic beyond schema definition.\n- **Malware or Obfuscation:** The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard libraries. No obfuscation or malware signatures are evident.\n\n**3. Scores Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the absence of malicious behavior, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is not obfuscated; score of 0 is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is a standard migration script with no security flaws, a low risk score (around 0) is justified.\n\n**4. Critical Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- No claims are based on assumptions; the analysis is consistent with standard Django practices.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, external data handling, or dynamic execution.\n\n**5. Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**6. Additional Considerations:**\n\n- Even though the code is safe, always ensure that the migration files are from trusted sources.\n- The use of `uuid.uuid4()` and timezone-aware timestamps is standard and safe.\n- Foreign keys with `SET_NULL` on delete are common patterns; no issues there.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Code safety:** Confirmed, standard Django migration code.\n- **Malware:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risk:** Minimal, standard schema setup.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**This aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.**",
