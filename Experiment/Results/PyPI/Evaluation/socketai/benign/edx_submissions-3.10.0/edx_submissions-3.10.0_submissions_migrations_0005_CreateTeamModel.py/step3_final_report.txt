  "purpose": "Create a new, comprehensive summary of the code's security assessment, consolidating insights from all reports.",
  "sources": "Django migration script creating 'TeamSubmission' model, using standard libraries (uuid, timezone), and linking to existing models via foreign keys.",
  "sinks": "Database schema creation and foreign key relationships; no runtime data processing or external data inputs.",
  "flows": "Schema definition flows from static code to database; no untrusted data sources or dynamic execution involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django migration script that defines a new model with UUIDs, timestamps, status choices, and foreign keys. It uses standard practices without dynamic code execution, external inputs, or obfuscation. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and a security risk score of 0. The code's clarity and adherence to best practices further confirm its safety. No logical errors or vulnerabilities are evident. The overall assessment aligns with the consensus that this is a safe, standard schema migration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django migration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the appropriate scores are zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code can be confidently considered safe for use.",
