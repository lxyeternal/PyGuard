{
  "purpose": "Define database migration for creating the TeamSubmission model and linking it to Submission",
  "sources": "Code reads data from model definitions, default values, and settings for AUTH_USER_MODEL",
  "sinks": "Database schema creation and foreign key constraints, no external data sinks detected",
  "flows": "Migration script defines flow from model definition to database schema; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic; standard Django migration code",
  "analysis": "The code is a Django migration script that creates a new model 'TeamSubmission' with fields for UUID, timestamps, status, and foreign key to user model. It links 'Submission' to 'TeamSubmission' via a foreign key. All fields use standard Django and third-party libraries, with typical default values and options. No data is fetched from external sources, nor does the code contain any malicious or suspicious logic, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The use of 'uuid.uuid4' is standard for unique identifiers, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code primarily concerns schema definitions and migration operations, which are safe and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django migration script for creating database models without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. Overall, the script appears safe.",
