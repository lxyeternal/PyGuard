{
  "purpose": "Define Django database migrations for creating the TeamSubmission model and linking it to existing Submission model.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from Django settings, UUID generation, and Django ORM fields; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Database operations (model creation, foreign key constraints); no direct data leaks or malicious actions present.",
  "flows": "Migration code flows from model definitions to database schema updates; no user input or external data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns identified. Use of standard Django migration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django migration script that creates a new model 'TeamSubmission' with various fields, including UUIDs, timestamps, and foreign keys. It also adds a foreign key to an existing 'Submission' model. All fields use standard Django ORM features, and the code relies on standard Django settings and third-party libraries like 'model_utils'. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies are properly managed, and the overall structure appears normal for a Django project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django migration script for setting up database models. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
