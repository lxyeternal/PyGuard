  "purpose": "Minimal module header or metadata marker indicating API version.",
  "sources": "No data input, external data, or environment variables; only a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; code contains only static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of functions, logic, or data handling; trivial code with no suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple docstring and a version string assignment, indicating minimal metadata. No operational logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. All reports correctly identify the benign, non-malicious nature of this snippet. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is effectively 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving as metadata or placeholder. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
