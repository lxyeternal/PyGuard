  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only version string declaration with no functional logic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a comment and a version string declaration. There are no functions, input handling, external calls, or data processing present. This indicates either a fragment or an initial part of a module with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the minimal code provided, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a simple, non-functional snippet possibly part of a larger module. No malicious intent or security concerns are evident.",
