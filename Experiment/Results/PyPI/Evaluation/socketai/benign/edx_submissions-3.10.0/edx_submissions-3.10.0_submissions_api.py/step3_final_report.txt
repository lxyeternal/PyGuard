  "purpose": "API for managing submissions, scores, and related data within a learning management system.",
  "sources": "User input via function arguments, database queries (ORM), cache retrievals, and signals.",
  "sinks": "Database writes, cache updates, and signal emissions; no external network activity or code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters to database models and cache; signals are emitted after data modifications; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; use of raw SQL in _get_submission_model for UUID fallback is justified and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard CRUD operations with exception handling, caching, and signaling. The raw SQL used for UUID hyphenation fallback is a controlled, safe workaround. No suspicious patterns, external network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's structure and behavior, reflecting minor concerns about raw SQL and cache exception handling but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The minor security concerns are justified and do not elevate the overall risk. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
