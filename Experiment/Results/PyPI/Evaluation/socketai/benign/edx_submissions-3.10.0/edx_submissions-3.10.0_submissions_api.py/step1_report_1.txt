  "purpose": "This code provides an API for managing submissions, scores, and related data in an educational assessment system, including creation, retrieval, updating, and caching of submission and score data.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user inputs (e.g., function parameters), external systems (e.g., database queries), and cache lookups.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to the database via ORM methods, cache storage, and external services via signals; responses include serialized data outputs. Notably, the code writes to the database and cache, and logs information.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (function arguments, user data) flows into database and cache operations via ORM queries and serializers. Data retrieved from cache or database is serialized and returned, with some flows involving signals that could trigger external handlers. No direct execution of untrusted code or command injection is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code handles potential exceptions gracefully, with logging. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. Use of warnings.filterwarnings('error') in get_submission may escalate runtime warnings to exceptions but is a standard approach. No backdoors, hidden behaviors, or privacy violations are identified.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an API for creating, retrieving, and managing submission data with appropriate exception handling and logging. The functions interact with the database using ORM queries, use caching for efficiency, and send signals for scoring events. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, reverse shells, or covert channels are evident. The use of raw SQL queries appears safe as they are parameterized and limited to internal logic. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or secrets. Exception handling and warnings are managed properly, and third-party libraries are standard. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured application layer without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code review indicates no malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage within this module. It is a standard implementation of a submissions API with secure data handling, proper exception management, and no suspicious or malicious code detected. The malware score is 0, and security risks are minimal with a score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
