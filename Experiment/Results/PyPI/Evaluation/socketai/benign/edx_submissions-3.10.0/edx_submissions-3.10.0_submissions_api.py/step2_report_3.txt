  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine whether the findings and scores are reasonable based on the code provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and assigns malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward API with ORM interactions, caching, and signals. No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code. Use of raw SQL in `_get_submission_model` is justified for UUID hyphenation fallback and is safe in context.\n- **Verdict:** The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are justified.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (correct)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard CRUD, caching, and signals. Notes use of raw SQL but no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no secrets. The mention of raw SQL is a minor concern but used for UUID fallback, which is acceptable.\n- **Verdict:** The malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9 seem reasonable.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 is acceptable given the raw SQL, but perhaps slightly high; still, acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with standard CRUD, cache, signals, and no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and the use of raw SQL is justified.\n- **Verdict:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9 are appropriate.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (acceptable)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no malicious behavior, standard operations, and careful exception handling.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or obfuscation. The raw SQL for UUID fallback is acceptable.\n- **Verdict:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9 seem justified.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard API with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and proper validation.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation. The code is consistent with secure API practices.\n- **Verdict:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9 are appropriate.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the minimal security concerns primarily around the raw SQL for UUID fallback, which is justified and not malicious.\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (consistent with minor concerns about raw SQL, but not malicious)\n\n**Confidence in these assessments is high (around 1.0),** given the code's clarity, standard practices, and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and reasonable. No malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the low security risk scores reflect minor, justifiable concerns rather than actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
