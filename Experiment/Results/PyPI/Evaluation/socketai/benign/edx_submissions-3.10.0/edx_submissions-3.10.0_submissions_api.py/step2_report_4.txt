  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard data flow involving user input, database, cache, and signals. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Use of raw SQL is safe in context; no external network activity or code injection.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected. Malware score: **0**. Confidence: **1.0**.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard CRUD with cache and database, no suspicious external calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Raw SQL in `_get_submission_model` for UUID hyphenation is justified and safe.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity. Malware score: **0**. Confidence: **0.9**.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar CRUD operations, cache, signals, no suspicious external activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets or obfuscation. Use of raw SQL for UUID fallback is transparent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior. Malware score: **0**. Confidence: **0.9**.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard submission and score management, signals, cache, ORM. No external malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets or obfuscation. The raw SQL for UUID hyphenation is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity. Malware score: **0**. Confidence: **0.9**.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Typical data flow with validation, cache, database, signals. No suspicious external connections.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is standard and secure.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity. Malware score: **0**. Confidence: **0.9**.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured API for submission and score management.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The only minor point is the use of raw SQL for UUID hyphenation fallback, which is justified and safe in context.\n- **Scores Justification:** All malware scores are 0, aligning with the analysis. Security risk scores are minimal (0.1-0.2), reflecting typical concerns about cache exposure or raw SQL but no active threats.\n- **Potential Malicious Behavior:** None detected. No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious payloads.\n- **Assumptions & Claims:** All claims about security are reasonable; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are based on weak evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1** — typical minimal risks related to cache exposure and raw SQL usage, but no active threats.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall security posture of this code is very strong. It functions as a standard, secure API with no malicious intent or supply chain sabotage evident.",
