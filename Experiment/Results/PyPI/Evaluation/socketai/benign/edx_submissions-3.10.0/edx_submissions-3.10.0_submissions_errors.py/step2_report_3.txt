  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of class definitions for custom exceptions related to a submission API.\n- The code is static, with no runtime data processing, external input, or dynamic behavior beyond class instantiation.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning**\n\n- All reports correctly note that the only dynamic element is the use of `copy.deepcopy()` in `SubmissionRequestError`'s constructor, which is standard practice to prevent shared mutable state.\n- The use of `self.args += (self.field_errors,)` in `SubmissionRequestError` is slightly unconventional but not problematic; it appends additional info to the exception's args tuple, which is acceptable in Python.\n- No logical errors, security flaws, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores and suggest changes**\n\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code is purely class definitions for error handling with no runtime data handling, no external communication, and no malicious logic, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score is 0, and the security risk is 0, which is consistent.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports assume the code is safe, which is correct.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made or need to be challenged.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure consistency of scores**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence in safety)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of custom exception classes for an API. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further action is necessary; the code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
