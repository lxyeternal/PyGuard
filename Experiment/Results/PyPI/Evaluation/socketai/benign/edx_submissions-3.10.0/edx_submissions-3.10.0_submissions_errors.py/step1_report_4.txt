  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various submission-related errors in an API.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, __init__ methods, copy.deepcopy, self.args, __repr__ method",
  "sinks": "Potentially in the __repr__ method where message and error details are formatted; copy.deepcopy usage",
  "flows": "Error instantiation -> storing deep copies of field_errors -> string representation via __repr__",
  "anomalies": "Use of self.args += (self.field_errors,) in __init__, which modifies the Exception args tuple; no apparent handling of untrusted data or external inputs",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception classes, inheriting from built-in and custom base exceptions. The SubmissionRequestError class uses copy.deepcopy to safely store field_errors, preventing external modifications. The __repr__ method formats class information for debugging purposes. No user input is processed or executed dynamically, and no network or system interactions occur within these classes. The use of self.args += might be unconventional but is not inherently malicious. Overall, this code appears to be standard exception handling with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines exception classes for error handling and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior. No evidence of malware, data leaks, or supply chain attacks is present.",
