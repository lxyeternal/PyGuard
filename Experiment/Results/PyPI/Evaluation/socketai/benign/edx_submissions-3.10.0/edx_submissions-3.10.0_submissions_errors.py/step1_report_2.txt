{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to submission actions in an API context.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data pertains to internal error handling and message formatting.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow involving untrusted data; errors are raised and formatted internally.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; error objects are instantiated and raised within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; use of deepcopy on error fields is standard for copying mutable data.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for custom exceptions with inheritance hierarchies. The SubmissionRequestError class deep copies a provided dictionary to avoid shared references, which is standard practice. There is no user input processing, network communication, or file I/O. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The code structure and formatting are straightforward and conventional for defining exception classes. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical set of custom exception class definitions for an API error handling module. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. The code is safe and intentionally designed for error reporting without external data handling or covert operations.",
