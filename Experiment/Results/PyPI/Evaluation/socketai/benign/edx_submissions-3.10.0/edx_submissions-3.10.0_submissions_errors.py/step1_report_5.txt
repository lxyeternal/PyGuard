  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for submission-related errors in an API.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads; exception classes are static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or processing occurs within these class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; these are purely class declarations for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward exception class definitions without dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from base exceptions, primarily to handle various error conditions related to submission processes. The only method with logic is the __init__ method of SubmissionRequestError, which deep copies a provided dictionary to avoid shared references and appends it to the exception args. No external data handling, network calls, or code execution occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception handling code.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard custom exception class definitions for managing errors in an API context. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears safe and typical for application error handling.",
