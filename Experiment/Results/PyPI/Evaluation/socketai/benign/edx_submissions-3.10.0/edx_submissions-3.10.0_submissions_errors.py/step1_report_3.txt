{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling submission-related errors in an API, including internal errors, not found errors, request errors, and specific errors for team submissions.",
  "sources": "Code explicitly creates exception objects and uses deep copy for field_errors; no external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not process untrusted input, execute system commands, or handle sensitive data beyond exception message storage.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and propagation, mainly for error handling; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs identified. The deep copy of field_errors is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for specific submission error scenarios, with a specialized constructor in SubmissionRequestError to handle message and field_errors. It utilizes copy.deepcopy to safely copy error details, and includes a __repr__ method for debugging. No external input reading, network calls, or system modifications are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. The structure is typical for exception handling in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling with no malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and does not pose any supply chain or runtime security risks.",
