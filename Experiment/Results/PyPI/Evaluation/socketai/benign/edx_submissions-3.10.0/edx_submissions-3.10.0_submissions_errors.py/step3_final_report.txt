  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for submission-related errors, including specific cases for team submissions and request errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with no external data input or output; only internal exception handling logic.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static class definitions with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'self.args += (self.field_errors,)' is slightly unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions, with the only dynamic operation being a deepcopy of 'field_errors' to prevent shared mutable state. No external data, network activity, or code execution occurs. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and follows standard Python exception patterns. No malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The unconventional use of extending 'self.args' does not introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for an API. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
