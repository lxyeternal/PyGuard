{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling submission-related errors in an API, including internal, not found, request errors, and duplicate submissions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; exception class definitions are static and do not read input or data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication occurs within these class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input, as the code only defines exception classes without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior present; the code appears to be straightforward class definitions for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a hierarchy of custom exceptions for a submission API, with detailed documentation and a constructor that deep-copies error details. The only dynamic element is copying 'field_errors' in SubmissionRequestError, which is standard practice and does not pose security risks. No external input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code does not include any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions for error handling in an API. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
