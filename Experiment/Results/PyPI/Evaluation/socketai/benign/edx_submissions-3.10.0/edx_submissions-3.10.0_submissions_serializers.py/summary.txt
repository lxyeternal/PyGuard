  "conclusion": "The code is well-structured, with appropriate validation and no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of RawField introduces a minor potential risk if external data is untrusted, but validation mitigates this. Overall, the serializers are safe for supply chain use, with scores accurately reflecting the low risk."
