  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code models submissions, scores, team submissions, and external grading queues. It emphasizes data integrity, proper use of signals, and security tokens ('pullkey') for external interactions. No malicious code or backdoors are identified.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justification: No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. The 'pullkey' is a security token, but its management is external to this code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  Justification: The code is clear, standard Django ORM, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1  \n  Justification: Slight concern about 'pullkey' being a secret token, but no evident vulnerability.\n\n**Assessment:** This report is reasonable. The code appears secure and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on data flow, standard Django practices, and queue management. No suspicious code or secrets.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justification: No malicious activity or code injection.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  Justification: Clear, standard code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1  \n  Justification: Similar minor concern about 'pullkey' scope, but no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard models, queue management, and signal handling. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justification: No malware, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  Justification: Clear code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n  Slightly higher, but still justified as the 'pullkey' is a token for queue security, which should be managed securely outside this code.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on data flow, standard practices, no malicious code, and proper handling of tokens.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justification: No malware or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  Justification: Clear code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n  Same reasoning as before.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with emphasis on data flow, no backdoors, and standard security practices.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  Justification: No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  Justification: Clear code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n  Same reasoning.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.1-0.2 in reports, justified by the presence of 'pullkey' which is a security token. This token should be managed securely outside of this code, but within this code, it is handled appropriately.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n  The code is standard, with no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n  The code is clear, well-structured, and readable.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2**  \n  The only minor concern is the 'pullkey' field, which is a security token. Its security depends on external management, but no vulnerabilities are evident here.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a well-implemented, standard Django-based system for managing submissions, scores, and external grading queues. No malicious activity, sabotage, or backdoors are present. The only aspect to monitor is the secure handling of 'pullkey' outside of this codebase.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0.2**",
