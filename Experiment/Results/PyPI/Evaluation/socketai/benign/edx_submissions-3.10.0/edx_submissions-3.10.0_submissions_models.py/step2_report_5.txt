  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, focusing on the evidence provided and the logic behind the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes models managing student responses, scores, team submissions, and external grading queues.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. The 'pullkey' is a secret token for external grader interactions but is managed outside this code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious code or backdoors. The code is standard, with a high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The only potential concern is the 'pullkey', but since it's a token managed externally, its presence isn't inherently malicious. The score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard models and logic for handling submissions, scores, and queues.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, credentials, or obfuscation. Environment variables are used for timing, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity. Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies no malicious behavior. The reasoning is consistent, and the low risk score reflects that.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar models and logic, with standard data flows.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The 'pullkey' is a security token but stored as plain text, which is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious intent. Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough. The slightly higher risk score (0.2) accounts for the 'pullkey' being a security token stored in plain text, but this is standard practice, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages submissions, scores, queues, with data flows from user input and external systems.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code or backdoors. 'Pullkey' is a security token, properly scoped.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior. Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The presence of 'pullkey' as a token is normal, and no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar data management for submissions and external queues.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. 'Pullkey' is a security token, but its handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity. Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the previous reports. The 'pullkey' is a security measure, not a malicious backdoor.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, citing no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), primarily due to the 'pullkey' field, which is a security token stored as plain text. This is a common pattern but should be protected in practice.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No evidence of malicious code, sabotage, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** Given the handling of 'pullkey' as a security token, I would assign a **risk score of 0.2**. While it's standard to store tokens as plain text in the database, this should be protected via proper access controls outside of code, which is not evident here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Risk           | 0.2            |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an educational submission system. No malicious activity or sabotage is detected. The only minor concern relates to token handling, which is a common practice but should be secured outside of code.",
