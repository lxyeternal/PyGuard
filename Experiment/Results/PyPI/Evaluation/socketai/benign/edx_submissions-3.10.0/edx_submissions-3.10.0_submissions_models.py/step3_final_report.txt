  "purpose": "Models and logic for managing student responses, scores, team submissions, and external grading queues in an educational platform.",
  "sources": "Database fields for user IDs, course and item identifiers, external queue status, and secret tokens ('pullkey') used for external grader interactions.",
  "sinks": "Database storage of sensitive tokens, external system interactions via 'pullkey', and signal handlers updating scores and submissions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input and external systems into models; signals trigger score updates; 'pullkey' used for external grading communication; no dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. 'pullkey' stored as plain text, but managed externally; no internal verification or secret handling shown.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django ORM models, signal handlers, and transaction management. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The 'pullkey' is a security token, but its management is outside this code scope. The code's structure and practices are sound, with no signs of sabotage or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation for submission and scoring management. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident. The only minor concern is the external handling of 'pullkey', which is typical for security tokens but should be protected outside this code. Overall, the supply chain security posture is solid.",
