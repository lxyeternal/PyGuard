      "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup utility with minimal security concerns. The primary potential issue is the use of os.system() for tagging based on command-line input, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. However, in controlled environments, this risk is negligible. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The overall security risk is low, and the code is safe for use with standard precautions."

      "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation for submission and scoring management. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident. The only minor concern is the external handling of 'pullkey', which is typical for security tokens but should be protected outside this code. Overall, the supply chain security posture is solid."

External API reliance warrants trust but does not constitute malicious intent. The low risk scores are justified, and malware/obfuscation scores are accurate."

The use of RawField introduces a minor potential risk if external data is untrusted, but validation mitigates this. Overall, the serializers are safe for supply chain use, with scores accurately reflecting the low risk."

The security posture relies on the external get_submissions() function, which appears to be used normally. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is 0.2, reflecting low but present external dependency risk. No further issues are identified."
