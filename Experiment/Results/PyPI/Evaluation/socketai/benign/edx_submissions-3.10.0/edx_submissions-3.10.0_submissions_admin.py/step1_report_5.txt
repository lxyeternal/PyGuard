{
  "purpose": "This code defines Django admin interfaces for managing submissions, scores, and related models in an educational platform.",
  "sources": "User inputs via the Django admin interface; URL reversing functions; database queries for scores and submissions.",
  "sinks": "Format HTML for admin links; potentially expose model IDs or URLs in admin views.",
  "flows": "User inputs in admin interface -> URL reversal and HTML formatting functions -> display in admin views.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. Use of URL reversal and HTML formatting appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected. No external network connections or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up Django admin views for models related to submissions and scores, with standard patterns such as search fields, readonly fields, URL reversing, and HTML formatting for links. The usage of format_html and reverse functions is consistent with normal Django practices. There are no signs of malicious code such as dynamic code execution, hidden network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code does not handle untrusted inputs directly from external sources, only within Django admin context. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible. Overall, the implementation appears to be straightforward and aligned with typical Django admin customization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django admin configuration for educational submission models without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The security risk score is low, with no apparent vulnerabilities.",
