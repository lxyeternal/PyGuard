  "purpose": "The code defines Django admin interfaces for managing submissions, scores, and related models within an educational platform.",
  "sources": "URL reversal for admin change pages, model fields used for display, and data retrieval from database queries.",
  "sinks": "HTML formatting of links for admin pages, potential exposure of model IDs, and data retrieved from database queries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database models through admin display methods and URL construction to generate clickable admin links.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or obfuscated code, and no indication of data leaks or backdoors. Use of format_html is standard for admin link creation. No dynamic code execution or suspicious URL patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides admin interfaces for models related to submissions and scores. It uses Django's admin features such as search_fields, list_display, and URL reverse for linking to model change pages. The code filters and displays model fields, constructs URLs safely using reverse, and formats links with format_html for admin UI. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. It appears to be standard Django admin customization without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django admin configuration for managing submission-related models with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. Security risks are minimal and typical of Django admin customizations.",
