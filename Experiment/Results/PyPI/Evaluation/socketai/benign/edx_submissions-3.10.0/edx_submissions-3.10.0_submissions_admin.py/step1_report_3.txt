  "purpose": "Admin interface for managing submissions, scores, and related data models in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reads from Django models (Score, ScoreSummary, StudentItem, Submission, TeamSubmission), reverse URL lookups, and HTML formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "Generates HTML links with format_html, possibly to external admin pages or internal links. No direct data sinks to network or filesystem are present.",
  "flows": "Data is retrieved from models, displayed in admin interface, with URL generation for object editing links, and formatted for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. Use of reverse and format_html is standard for Django admin. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. Search fields and display methods are straightforward. No external network calls or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Django admin classes for various models with standard practices, including search, list display, read-only fields, and URL link generation via reverse and format_html. No input/output operations suggest external data manipulation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected. The use of format_html and reverse functions is typical for Django admin link creation. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling are apparent. The code functions solely for administrative data presentation and management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django admin module for managing submission and scoring models with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious code elements identified.",
