{
  "purpose": "This code defines Django admin views for managing submissions, scores, and related models within an educational platform.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Django models such as Score, ScoreSummary, StudentItem, Submission, and TeamSubmission. It also constructs URLs via Django's reverse function and formats HTML for admin links.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe HTML links generated with format_html. Use of reverse to generate URLs, but no user input directly influences URL parameters. No external data writes or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Model data is accessed through model instances; URLs are generated with static IDs or model instance attributes; HTML links are formatted for admin interface display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code mainly involves standard Django admin configurations. No indication of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly manages admin views and displays related model data with no external data handling beyond URL generation. The use of format_html for safe HTML formatting within Django admin is standard practice. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or system compromise. No suspicious external connections or dynamic code execution are present. The code relies on Django’s secure URL reversing and standard admin practices, with no apparent security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django admin configuration for educational submission management, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any external network operations, data exfiltration, or contain obfuscated/malicious code.",
