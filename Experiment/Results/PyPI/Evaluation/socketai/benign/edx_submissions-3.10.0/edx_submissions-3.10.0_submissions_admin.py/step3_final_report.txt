{
  "purpose": "The code provides Django admin customizations for models related to submissions, scores, and student items, primarily for display and management within the Django admin interface.",
  "sources": "URL reversal via 'reverse()' for generating links, data retrieval from model fields such as 'student_item', 'score', 'score_summary', and 'submission' objects.",
  "sinks": "HTML output via 'format_html()' which renders links to admin change pages, and URL generation for internal admin navigation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model instances through display methods ('course_id', 'item_id', etc.) to HTML links generated with 'reverse()' and 'format_html()' for admin interface display.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard Django admin features is appropriate and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard Django admin configuration for managing models related to submissions and scores. It employs safe practices such as 'reverse()' for URL generation and 'format_html()' for HTML output, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external network activity. The search fields, readonly fields, and display methods are straightforward and do not introduce security vulnerabilities. The code does not process untrusted user input directly in a dangerous way, nor does it contain dynamic code execution or external data leaks. The overall structure and logic follow best practices for Django admin customization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threats. It is a standard implementation for Django admin interfaces managing internal data models. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk. No modifications are necessary.",
