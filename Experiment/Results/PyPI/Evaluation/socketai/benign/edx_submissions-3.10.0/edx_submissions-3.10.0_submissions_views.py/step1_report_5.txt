{
  "purpose": "To retrieve and display all submissions associated with a specific student item in a Django web application.",
  "sources": "Request data is indirectly passed via URL parameters (course_id, student_id, item_id); get_submissions function retrieves submissions based on the student_item_dict.",
  "sinks": "The get_submissions function is called with user-controlled data; the data is included in the context and rendered in a template.",
  "flows": "URL parameters (course_id, student_id, item_id) flow into student_item_dict, which is passed to get_submissions; the submissions or error message are then included in the context for rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious code patterns. Error handling captures exceptions without exposing sensitive info. No external or suspicious network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django view protected by login_required, ensuring only authenticated users access it. It constructs a dictionary with URL parameters and uses it to call get_submissions. Error handling is limited to setting an error message. The data flow appears standard for a web app retrieving data based on URL parameters. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The function relies on an external API, which appears to be legitimate, with no apparent malicious intent. The code structure and logic are typical for a Django view and do not indicate obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django view for fetching and displaying submissions related to a student item. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe, with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
