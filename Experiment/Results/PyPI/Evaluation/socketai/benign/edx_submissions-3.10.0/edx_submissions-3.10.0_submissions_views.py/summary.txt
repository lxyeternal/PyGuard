  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure Django view with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security posture relies on the external get_submissions() function, which appears to be used normally. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is 0.2, reflecting low but present external dependency risk. No further issues are identified."
