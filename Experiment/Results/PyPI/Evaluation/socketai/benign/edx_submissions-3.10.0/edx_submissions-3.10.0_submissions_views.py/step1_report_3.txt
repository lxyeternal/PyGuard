  "purpose": "The code provides a Django view for retrieving and displaying submissions associated with a specific student item within a course, intended for developer use.",
  "sources": "Request parameters: course_id, student_id, item_id; Function call: get_submissions(student_item_dict)",
  "sinks": "Rendering the 'submissions.html' template with context data; potential exposure if context contains sensitive data",
  "flows": "Request parameters → student_item_dict → get_submissions() → context dictionary → render() with template",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behavior observed; standard use of Django and API functions.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Django patterns for authenticated views, retrieving data via an API call, and rendering a template. It captures input parameters, constructs a data dictionary, and calls get_submissions() without sanitization. Errors are caught and relayed via context. No suspicious data handling or malicious code is present. The flow is straightforward, with no evidence of code injection, data leaks, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Django view for displaying submission data. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
