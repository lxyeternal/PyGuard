  "purpose": "Retrieve and display submissions associated with a specific student item in a Django web application.",
  "sources": "URL parameters (course_id, student_id, item_id); get_submissions() API call",
  "sinks": "Rendering the submissions in a template; potential data exposure if get_submissions() returns sensitive data",
  "flows": "URL parameters → dictionary (student_item_dict) → get_submissions() API → context → template rendering",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; exception handling limited to SubmissionRequestError; external API behavior unknown",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django view that constructs a data dictionary from URL parameters, calls an external API function, and renders a template with the results. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The security of the data depends on the implementation of get_submissions(), which is outside this snippet. Exception handling is minimal but appropriate. The data flow is standard, and no untrusted code execution occurs. External dependency risk is minimal but should be monitored. Overall, the code is safe, with low security risk, and no malware or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure Django view with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security posture relies on the external get_submissions() function, which appears to be used normally. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is 0.2, reflecting low but present external dependency risk. No further issues are identified.",
