{
  "purpose": "Provide a Django view to retrieve and display submissions associated with a student item in an educational platform.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: request, course_id, student_id, item_id; get_submissions function call",
  "sinks": "Rendering of 'submissions.html' with context data; potential data leakage if sensitive info is included in submissions",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to create student_item_dict, passed to get_submissions, and results are rendered in the response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code, no unusual or malicious code patterns observed. The get_submissions function call's behavior depends on its implementation, but here it appears to be a standard API call.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a secure view that requires login, accepts input parameters, and calls an external API to retrieve data. It handles exceptions properly by catching SubmissionRequestError. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The context passed to the template appears straightforward, with no indication of sensitive data exposure beyond what is intended. The security of the data depends on the implementation of get_submissions, which is not provided, but the usage here is standard and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard secure Django view with no detected malicious behavior. It handles input and output appropriately without suspicious activity or backdoors. The primary risk depends on the external get_submissions implementation, but based on this code alone, there are no security concerns.",
