{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Django view to retrieve and display submissions related to a specific student item in an educational platform.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: course_id, student_id, item_id from the URL; get_submissions() call which retrieves submission data based on student_item_dict.",
  "sinks": "Rendering the 'submissions.html' template with the context data, including submissions or error message.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct student_item_dict, which is passed to get_submissions(); the retrieved submissions are added to the context; the context is rendered in a template.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard use of Django decorators and functions; get_submissions() source not shown, but called with a constructed dictionary; no evident malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django view function that constructs a dictionary from URL parameters, calls a presumably safe API function to get submissions, and renders a template with the results. No user input is directly executed or injected into code; the data flow appears straightforward. The get_submissions() function's internals are not provided, but its usage here is standard. Exception handling is limited to SubmissionRequestError, with no suspicious fallback behaviors. Overall, no signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django view for displaying submissions with no signs of malicious intent or security issues based on the provided code. It safely handles input parameters and does not perform any risky operations.",
