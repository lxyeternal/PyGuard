{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and display submissions related to a specific student item in a Django web application.",
  "sources": "Request parameters: course_id, student_id, item_id; Function get_submissions() which fetches submission data.",
  "sinks": "Rendering the 'submissions.html' page with submissions data or error message; get_submissions() which may query external resources or databases.",
  "flows": "Request parameters (sources) are used to build student_item_dict, passed to get_submissions (potential data source), results are included in context and rendered in the response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated code, no use of insecure functions. Exception handling is specific to SubmissionRequestError, no broad exception catching. No untrusted input processing beyond parameter passing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django view function designed for data retrieval and display. It accepts request parameters, constructs a data dictionary, calls an external API function get_submissions, and handles specific errors. No evidence of malicious code, data leakage, or backdoors. The get_submissions function's implementation is unknown, but based on usage, it appears to be a standard data access function. The code does not execute untrusted code, nor does it leak sensitive info directly. It simply fetches data based on input parameters and renders a template.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward view for displaying submissions related to a student item. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. Its security depends largely on the implementation of get_submissions, which is not shown. Overall, no malicious intent or security threats are evident from this code.",
