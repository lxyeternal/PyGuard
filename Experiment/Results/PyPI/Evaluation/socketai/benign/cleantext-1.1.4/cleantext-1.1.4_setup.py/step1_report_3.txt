  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'cleantext' Python package, used to specify package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static assignment of version and maintainer info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output or external calls are made.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only reading a local file and static assignments are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed. Use of standard setup tools and straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads the README file for the long description and defines package metadata, including name, version, author info, URL, license, and dependencies. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
