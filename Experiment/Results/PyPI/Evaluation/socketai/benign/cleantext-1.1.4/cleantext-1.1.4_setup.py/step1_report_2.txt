  "purpose": "This code is for setting up and installing the 'cleantext' Python package, providing metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing pathlib and setuptools modules for setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "None that directly process untrusted data; setup functions do not handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. Use of standard setup procedures with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for package setup, reads a markdown file for long description, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with this information. No untrusted data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious dependencies or code patterns. The dependencies and metadata appear typical for a public Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
