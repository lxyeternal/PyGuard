{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package named 'cleantext' for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and package configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; imports from pathlib and setuptools for setup process.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input or external data sources are used at runtime; no network or data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup process uses static package information.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a local README file for the description, defines package metadata, and specifies dependencies. There are no dynamic or external inputs influencing behavior, nor any code execution beyond standard setup functions. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or anomalous activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. It simply prepares the package for distribution.",
