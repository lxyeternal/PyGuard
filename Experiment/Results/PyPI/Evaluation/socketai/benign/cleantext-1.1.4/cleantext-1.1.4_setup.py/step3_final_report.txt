{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, static metadata definitions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or sinks; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Static data assignment; no dynamic or untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, reads a local README file, and calls setup() with static metadata. It does not execute untrusted input, perform network operations, or include obfuscated code. All dependencies are common, and no malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
