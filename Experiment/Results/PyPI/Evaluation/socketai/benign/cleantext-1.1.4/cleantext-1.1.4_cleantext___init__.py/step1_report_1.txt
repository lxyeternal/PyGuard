  "purpose": "Define module metadata and export specific functions from the cleantext package",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cleantext, module metadata variables",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; module imports internal components and sets metadata",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module 'cleantext', sets version and maintainer metadata, and defines an export list. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The import is from a relative module, indicating internal package structure, and no external communication or risky operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an initialization module for a package, setting metadata and importing functions, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
