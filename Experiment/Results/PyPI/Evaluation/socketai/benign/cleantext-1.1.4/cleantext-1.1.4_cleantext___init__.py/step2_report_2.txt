  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content:**\n```python\n\"\"\"__init__\"\"\"\nfrom .cleantext import *\n\n__version__ = '1.1.4'\n__maintainer__ = 'Prasanth Gudiwada'\n\n__all__ = ['clean', 'clean_words']\n```\nThis code is a typical `__init__.py` file for a Python package, importing all functions from a local module `cleantext`, setting package metadata, and defining the public API.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Security Risks:**\n- The import statement `from .cleantext import *` imports all symbols from the `cleantext` module. While using `*` is generally discouraged for clarity, it is not inherently malicious.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network communication, or handle untrusted data.\n- There are no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The metadata variables are static and do not indicate any suspicious activity.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks.\n- They correctly identify that the code serves as a package initializer, setting metadata and importing functions.\n- No anomalies, data flows, or external communications are detected.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of risky operations.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code itself does not warrant a higher risk score; it appears benign.\n- The use of `import *` is not ideal but is common in package `__init__.py` files and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard package initialization script with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action is needed.",
