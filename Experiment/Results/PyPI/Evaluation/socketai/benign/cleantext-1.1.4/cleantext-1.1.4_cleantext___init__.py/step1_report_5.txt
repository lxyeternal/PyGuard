  "purpose": "Initialize module with imports and metadata for the package",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cleantext, module metadata (__version__, __maintainer__, __all__)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely metadata and import setup",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module 'cleantext', sets version and maintainer metadata, and defines the public interface. It lacks any dynamic execution, network calls, or data handling that could suggest malicious activity. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module initialization file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
