  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets module metadata",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or suspicious activity; just metadata and import",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module 'cleantext', sets version and maintainer metadata, and defines exported symbols. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns. The import statement is standard for Python packages, and no other malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
