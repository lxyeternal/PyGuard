  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard module metadata and import statement",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains metadata (__version__, __maintainer__, __all__) and a single import from a local module (.cleantext). There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The import is relative, indicating it is part of a larger package, and no malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving to set module metadata and import necessary functions. There is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
