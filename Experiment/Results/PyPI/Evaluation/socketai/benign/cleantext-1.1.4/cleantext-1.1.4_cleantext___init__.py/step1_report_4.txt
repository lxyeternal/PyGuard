  "purpose": "Initialize module and import all functions from the cleantext submodule",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cleantext",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static assignments and import",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; version and maintainer info are static; no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code sets metadata variables (__version__, __maintainer__) and imports everything from a local module. There are no runtime inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The import is a typical package structure pattern; no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
