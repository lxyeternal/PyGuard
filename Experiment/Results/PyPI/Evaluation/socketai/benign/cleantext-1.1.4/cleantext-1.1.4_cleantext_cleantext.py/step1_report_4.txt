{
  "purpose": "Provides text cleaning and preprocessing functions for natural language processing tasks, including tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from function parameters; retrieves stopwords from NLTK corpus; downloads stopwords if not available.",
  "sinks": "Uses regex substitution on input text; potentially manipulates data; no data is sent externally or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input text -> regex replacement (if specified) -> cleaning operations (whitespace, case, digits, punctuation, stopwords, stemming) -> output text or list of words.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; dynamic download of NLTK stopwords only occurs if missing, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard NLP preprocessing functions with optional parameters controlling behavior. It employs NLTK for stopword management, including fallback download. No malicious code, external data exfiltration, or suspicious activity is present. The regex and string manipulations are safe and typical for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate NLP preprocessing code with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. It does not perform any harmful operations such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious network activity.",
