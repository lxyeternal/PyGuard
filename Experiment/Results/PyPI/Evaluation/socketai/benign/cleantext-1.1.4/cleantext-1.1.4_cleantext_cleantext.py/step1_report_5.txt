{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to clean and process text data with various options for normalization, tokenization, and stemming.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from function arguments; loads stopwords from nltk.corpus; may download 'stopwords' dataset if not available.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leaks, system modification, or malicious network activity.",
  "flows": "Input text flows through cleaning functions, with optional modifications based on parameters. No external or untrusted data is injected beyond initial input.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic download of nltk stopwords, which can cause network requests during runtime if stopwords are not available locally. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or malicious pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard text cleaning utility. It loads stopwords from nltk, with a fallback download if needed, which is common in NLP workflows. The cleaning operations include regex replacements, whitespace normalization, case conversion, digit removal, punctuation removal, stopword removal, and stemming. These are all standard operations without malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code is detected; no network connections or data exfiltration code present. The use of nltk.download could be considered an external dependency load but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate text cleaning operations commonly used in NLP pipelines. No malicious behavior or malware is present. The only noteworthy point is runtime dependency download of stopwords, which is standard in NLP but could be optimized. Overall, the code appears safe.",
