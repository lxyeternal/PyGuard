{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to clean and preprocess text data, including removing punctuation, stopwords, stemming, and applying custom regex replacements.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from function parameters; loads stopwords from nltk.corpus; downloads stopwords if not present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted external data or perform external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed locally through regex replacements, string manipulations, and nltk stopword removal and stemming without external communications or sensitive data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Use of nltk.download() could be misused if exploited to download malicious packages, but within context, it is a benign dependency download. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform standard text cleaning operations using common libraries like re, string, and nltk. It dynamically downloads stopwords if missing, which is typical in NLP workflows. No external network connections are initiated during execution besides the nltk download, which is standard. No suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors are present. The functions are straightforward, with no code injection or data leakage mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard NLP text preprocessing utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on well-known libraries and performs expected operations without external harmful interactions.",
