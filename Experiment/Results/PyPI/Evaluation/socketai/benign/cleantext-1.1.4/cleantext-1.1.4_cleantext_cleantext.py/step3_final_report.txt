{
  "purpose": "The code provides NLP text cleaning functions, including whitespace normalization, punctuation removal, digit removal, stopword removal, stemming, and regex-based replacements, for preprocessing text data.",
  "sources": "Reads input text parameter; dynamically loads stopwords from nltk during execution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data exfiltration, network activity, or external data writes detected.",
  "flows": "Input text -> regex substitution (if any) -> whitespace normalization -> case folding -> removal of digits/punctuation/stopwords (if enabled) -> stemming (if enabled) -> output cleaned text or tokens.",
  "anomalies": "Uses nltk.download() at runtime for stopwords, which could trigger network requests; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard NLP preprocessing with optional steps controlled by parameters. It relies on nltk resources, downloading them if missing, which is typical but could be exploited if environment is compromised. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The dynamic download is a minor concern but common in NLP pipelines. No obfuscation detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to dependency download. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign NLP utility performing common text cleaning tasks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low risk score reflects the dependency download but does not indicate malicious intent.",
