{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to clean and preprocess text data by removing or transforming specific elements such as spaces, stopwords, punctuation, digits, and applying stemming or lowercasing, primarily for NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameter 'text' passed to 'clean' and 'clean_words' functions. It also reads stop words from the NLTK corpus, which may be downloaded if not available.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources, make network calls, or perform system modifications. It processes and returns cleaned text or lists of words.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed through various cleaning steps, including regex replacements, removal of whitespace, punctuation, digits, stopwords, and stemming. The flow involves applying these transformations sequentially based on parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The only dynamic operation is downloading stopwords if not available, which is standard in NLP pipelines.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward text preprocessing utility using common NLP techniques. It includes error handling for missing stopwords data, which involves downloading resources. No suspicious or malicious activities are evident. The download operation occurs only if needed and is a typical practice for resource-dependent NLP preprocessing. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard text cleaning operations without any malicious intent or security risks. It handles dependencies and resource management properly, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected.",
