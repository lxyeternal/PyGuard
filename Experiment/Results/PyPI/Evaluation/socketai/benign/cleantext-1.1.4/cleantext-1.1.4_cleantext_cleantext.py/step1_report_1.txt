{
  "purpose": "The code provides text cleaning functions to preprocess raw textual data by removing or transforming specific elements like stopwords, punctuation, numbers, and applying stemming, among other operations.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from function parameters; loads stopwords from nltk.corpus, which fetches stopwords based on language",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no output is written to network, files, or environment variables",
  "flows": "Input text is processed through various cleaning steps based on function arguments, with optional regular expression replacements and stemming",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. The code dynamically downloads stopwords if not available, which is standard practice; no hidden or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard text preprocessing with optional operations such as removing extra spaces, lowercasing, removing digits and punctuation, stopword removal, and stemming. It uses nltk's stopwords and stemmer, which are typical dependencies. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. The only dynamic behavior is the conditional download of stopwords from nltk, which is common in NLP pipelines. No network activity outside the nltk download occurs, and no sensitive data handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard text cleaning utility with no malicious intent. It uses common NLP libraries for stopword removal and stemming, with no suspicious or harmful behaviors identified.",
