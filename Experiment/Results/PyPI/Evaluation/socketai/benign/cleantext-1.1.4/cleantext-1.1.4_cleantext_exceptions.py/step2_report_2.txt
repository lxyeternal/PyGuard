  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception inheriting from `ValueError`. There are no data inputs, outputs, external dependencies, or complex logic involved. The class is intended solely for use as a specific exception in the `cleantext` context.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.\n   - No external data reading or writing.\n   - The only minor issue is a typo in one of the docstrings (\"Vlaue\" instead of \"Value\"), which is benign and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Risk Score Analysis**:\n   - The risk score is not explicitly provided in the reports, but since the code is benign, it should be very low, close to 0.\n   - No reasons to assign a higher score, as there's no vulnerability or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions & Claims**:\n   - All reports correctly state that the code is benign and contains no malicious features.\n   - The purpose is clearly defined and limited to exception handling.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the assessments are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (appropriate given the benign, straightforward class definition)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\nGiven the simplicity and benign intent, I agree with the reports' conclusions. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I concur with the assessments. The code is harmless, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.**",
