  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code is a straightforward Python class definition:\n```python\n\"\"\" Exceptions for cleantext\"\"\"\n\nclass CleanTextEmptyString(ValueError):\n    \"\"\"Vlaue error for cleantext\"\"\"\n```\n- It defines a custom exception inheriting from `ValueError`.\n- The class has a docstring with a minor typo (\"Vlaue\" instead of \"Value\"), but this is benign.\n- There are no data flows, external inputs, or suspicious code constructs.\n- The code is minimal, clear, and serves a specific purpose: signaling an error when an empty string is encountered in \"cleantext\" processing.\n\n**Assessment of the Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The analysis notes the absence of data flows, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- The typo in the docstring (Report 3) is benign and does not impact security.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign, simple class definition.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very close to 0, which is reasonable since there's no security risk.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Issues:**\n- The reports are consistent; no adjustments needed.\n- The only minor note is that the code itself is very simple and unlikely to be malicious or obfuscated.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. The code is harmless, and the scores reflect that well.",
