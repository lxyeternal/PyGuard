  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling empty string errors in the cleantext module",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definition does not read external data",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output present",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this is only a class definition for an exception",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple class extending built-in exception without unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from ValueError with a docstring. It appears to serve as a specific error type for the cleantext library. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and standard for Python exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard exception class definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
