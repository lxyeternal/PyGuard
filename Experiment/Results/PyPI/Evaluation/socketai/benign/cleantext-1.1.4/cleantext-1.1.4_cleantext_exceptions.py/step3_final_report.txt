  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling empty string errors in cleantext processing.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is a class definition with a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is used as an exception, not involving data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in docstring ('Vlaue' instead of 'Value'), but this is benign and non-security related.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python class defining a custom exception inheriting from ValueError. It contains no data flows, external inputs, or malicious constructs. The only issue is a minor typo in the docstring, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score should be near 0, reflecting the harmless nature of the code. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign intent and security safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate; the only adjustment needed is to set the risk score to 0.0 to accurately reflect the negligible security risk.",
