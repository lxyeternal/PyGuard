  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a single custom exception class `CleanTextEmptyString` inheriting from `ValueError`.\n   - The class has a docstring, with a minor typo (\"Vlaue\" instead of \"Value\") in one report, but this is benign.\n   - The class contains no additional logic, no data handling, no external calls, and no data flow.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there are no data sources, sinks, or flows.\n   - No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.\n   - The code does not read external data, write data, or perform any operations beyond class definition.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n   - The only minor issue is the typo in one report's docstring, which is not malicious or suspicious.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), reflecting the clear, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is only a class definition, there's no basis for any malicious activity.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior or obfuscation are warranted here.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Recommendations:**\n   - The code is a simple, harmless exception class.\n   - The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n   - No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard Python exception class with no security concerns. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
