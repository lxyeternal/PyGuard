  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to cleantext processing",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present in the code",
  "sinks": "No output or data handling points, especially untrusted data outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data propagation in the code",
  "anomalies": "The class appears to be a straightforward custom exception without additional logic; minor typo in the docstring ('Vlaue' instead of 'Value') but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from ValueError, intended for use in cleantext operations. It contains only a docstring and an empty class body, with no external dependencies, no data handling, and no suspicious constructs. The typo in the docstring is benign and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of a custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
