  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling empty string errors in a cleantext processing context.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points present; no untrusted data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features; simple class definition with a docstring.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from ValueError, intended to be used when a cleantext operation encounters an empty string. There are no external inputs, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious code constructs present. The class is straightforward and serves a specific, benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless class definition for a specific exception type. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
