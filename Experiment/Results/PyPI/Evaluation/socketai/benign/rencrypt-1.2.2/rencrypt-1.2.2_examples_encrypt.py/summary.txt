  "conclusion": "The code is a security-conscious cryptographic routine that employs best practices for in-memory data protection. There is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score of 0.2 reflects the use of system API calls for memory management but does not indicate danger."
