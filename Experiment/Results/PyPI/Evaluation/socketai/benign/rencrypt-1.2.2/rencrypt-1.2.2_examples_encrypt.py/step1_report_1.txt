{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform cryptographic operations such as key generation, encryption, and decryption using a specific cipher (AES256-GCM), with memory locking for security and system-specific memory management.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment variables (platform.system), reads from os.urandom for generating plaintext, and reads user/system data when setting memory limits on Windows.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'rencrypt' library's Cipher methods for encryption/decryption, and system API calls to adjust process working set size; also involves memory locking functions.",
  "flows": "Generates cryptographic key → locks memory → copies key into cipher object → encrypts plaintext into buffer → decrypts ciphertext from buffer → zeroizes sensitive data after use.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials are detected. Usage of memory locking and zeroization indicates security-conscious design. No obfuscated code or unexpected network activity. No external data exfiltration or system damage routines are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs secure cryptographic operations using well-defined memory management practices like locking and zeroization. It interfaces with Windows API to limit process memory usage, and uses standard cryptography procedures. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. The code relies on external libraries (rencrypt, zeroize, numpy) for cryptographic and memory functions. The code appears to be designed for secure in-memory encryption/decryption without persistent storage or external communication, aligning with security best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script implements cryptographic procedures with memory security considerations and system-specific optimizations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code is security-focused and appears to be a legitimate implementation for secure memory handling during cryptographic operations.",
