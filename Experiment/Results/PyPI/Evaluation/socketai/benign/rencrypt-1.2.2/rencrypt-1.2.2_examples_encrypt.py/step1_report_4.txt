  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the setup and usage of encryption and memory management for secure data handling using the 'rencrypt' library and system calls for memory locking and process memory limits.",
  "sources": "os.urandom() for generating plaintext; platform.system() for environment detection; imported modules for system and cryptography functions.",
  "sinks": "cipher.seal_in_place() and cipher.open_in_place() for encryption/decryption; zeroize1() and munlock() for secure memory erasure and unlocking; print statements for status updates.",
  "flows": "plaintext generated by os.urandom() -> locked in memory -> copied into cipher buffer -> encrypted in-place -> decrypted back into buffer -> plaintext comparison; key generated and zeroized; memory locked/unlocked around sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of system-specific API calls to manipulate process working set size and memory locking indicates an emphasis on secure memory handling. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. No external network activity or data exfiltration is observed. The code locks memory and zeroizes data, aligning with security best practices, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs cryptographic operations with explicit memory locking and zeroization, indicating a focus on secure memory management. It uses platform-specific API calls to limit process memory usage on Windows, which is common for security-sensitive applications. The cryptography appears to be implemented via the 'rencrypt' library, with key generation, encryption, and decryption handled correctly. No data leaks, malicious commands, or suspicious network activity are present. All operations are consistent with legitimate cryptographic procedures aimed at securing in-memory data. The code structure and variable naming are clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code insertion.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates secure cryptographic practices, including memory locking and zeroization, with no indications of malicious behavior or security sabotage. It is aligned with security standards for handling sensitive data in memory. The overall risk level is low, and no malware or malicious intent is detected.",
