  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, security-conscious cryptographic test suite designed for validation and correctness checks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1-0.2) are accurate and justified based on the analysis."
