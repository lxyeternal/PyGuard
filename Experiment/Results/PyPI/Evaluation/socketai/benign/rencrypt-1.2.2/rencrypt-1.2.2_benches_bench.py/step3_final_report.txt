  "purpose": "This code provides cryptographic benchmarking and file management utilities, including encryption, decryption, hashing, and performance measurement functions.",
  "sources": "File reads for hashing, encryption, decryption; random data generation for keys and IVs; directory and file creation/deletion functions.",
  "sinks": "File output during encryption/decryption; temporary files used for intermediate storage; print statements for performance metrics.",
  "flows": "Source data (file contents, random bytes) flows into cryptographic functions; encrypted/decrypted data flows into files; timing data flows into console output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; no network activity; standard cryptographic practices; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic operations with secure randomness, manages files and directories appropriately, and measures performance metrics. No external inputs influence critical operations maliciously. Temporary files are cleaned up properly. The cryptographic practices (AES-GCM, secure key generation) are sound. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The repeated key generation per operation is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate benchmarking utility with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, standard cryptographic benchmarking and file utility script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It employs secure practices and poses minimal security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, which is appropriate given its benchmarking purpose.",
