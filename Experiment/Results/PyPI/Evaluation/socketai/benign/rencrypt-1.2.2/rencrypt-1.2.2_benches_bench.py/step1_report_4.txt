    "Input files are read in chunks, encrypted, and written to output files.",
    "Random data is generated for keys, plaintext, and additional authenticated data (AAD).",
    "Timing measurements are taken around cryptographic operations and output via print statements.",
    "File hashes are compared to verify correctness after decryption.",
    "Temporary files are created and deleted during encrypt/decrypt operations."

  "anomalies": [
    "Repeated generation of new cryptographic keys for each encryption/decryption operation, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
    "Use of os.urandom for generating random keys and AAD, which is standard but could be misused if secret keys are leaked or hardcoded.",
    "No hardcoded credentials, URLs, or sensitive secrets are present.",
    "No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious variable names.",
    "The code performs cryptographic benchmarking without any network activity or system modifications."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs file handling, cryptographic operations, and benchmarking. It generates random keys and data using secure methods, manages files and directories safely, and avoids any network or system modifications. All cryptographic keys are generated dynamically and not hardcoded. The encryption/decryption functions include timing measurements but do not send data externally or contain backdoors. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The code is well-structured for testing cryptographic performance without suspicious behaviors. Overall, no malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is focused on cryptographic benchmarking and file management, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It uses standard secure practices for randomness and file handling, and there are no network or privacy violations. The code appears safe and intended for performance testing.",
