{
  "purpose": "The code performs secure file encryption and decryption using AES-GCM, manages system memory settings (notably on Windows), handles temporary directories and files, and verifies file integrity via hashing. It emphasizes security best practices such as memory locking, zeroization, and cleanup.",
  "sources": "Reads input files in chunks for encryption/decryption, generates cryptographic keys, reads system info, and creates temporary files/directories.",
  "sinks": "Writes encrypted/decrypted data to files, hashes files for verification, and manages temporary directories/files.",
  "flows": "Source data (file input, random bytes, system info) flows through cryptographic operations (seal/open), memory locking, and file I/O, with cleanup and zeroization at the end.",
  "anomalies": "Uses memory locking (`mlock`, `munlock`) on keys and buffers, zeroizes sensitive data, manages system-specific memory settings, and handles temporary files securely. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script encrypts and decrypts files securely with AES-GCM, manages system memory settings on Windows, handles temporary files/directories, and verifies integrity via hashing. It employs proper cryptographic practices, memory locking, and zeroization, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Minor implementation details such as buffer management and error handling are acceptable and do not impact security. The code is straightforward, purpose-driven, and aligns with security best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, security-conscious cryptographic utility performing secure file encryption/decryption. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain issues are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
