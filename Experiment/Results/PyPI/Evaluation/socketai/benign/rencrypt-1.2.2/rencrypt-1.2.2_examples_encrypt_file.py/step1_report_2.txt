{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for file encryption and decryption using the Cipher module with secure memory handling, temporary directory management, and file hashing for verification.",
  "sources": "Reads include file reads in chunks, reading from the temporary input file, and reading/writing files for encryption and decryption. Inputs also include generated keys and random data (os.urandom).",
  "sinks": "Writes to encrypted output files, decrypted output files, and temporary files. Uses os.remove for cleanup.",
  "flows": "Reads from input files and generates keys, then encrypts data block-by-block, storing ciphertext; then reads ciphertext, decrypts, and writes plaintext; finally compares hashes for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity; secure memory locking used; no obfuscated code or unusual control flow; proper cleanup procedures. No unusual or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs secure file handling and cryptographic operations, including memory locking for sensitive data, directory and file management, and cryptographic key generation. It encrypts and decrypts files in chunks with authenticated encryption, ensuring data integrity. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or backdoors are present. All cryptographic operations seem purpose-driven, and cleanup functions are properly called to minimize residual sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, focused on secure file encryption/decryption with proper security practices such as memory locking and zeroization. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The overall security risk is minimal.",
