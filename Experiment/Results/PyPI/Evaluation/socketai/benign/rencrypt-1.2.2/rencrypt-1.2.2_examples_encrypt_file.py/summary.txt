  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, security-conscious cryptographic utility performing secure file encryption/decryption. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain issues are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis."
