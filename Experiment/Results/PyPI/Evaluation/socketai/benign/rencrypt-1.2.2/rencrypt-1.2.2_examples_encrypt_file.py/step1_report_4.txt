{
  "purpose": "The script appears to perform file encryption and decryption using AES-GCM, manage temporary directories and files, and handle secure memory operations for cryptographic keys and buffers.",
  "sources": "File input (read_file_in_chunks, open(file_path)), user environment (Path.home()), random data (os.urandom), standard input/output streams.",
  "sinks": "Writing encrypted and decrypted data to files, creating and deleting directories, zeroing sensitive data, locking memory buffers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (source) into encryption routines (sink), then to output files. Sensitive keys and buffers are secured via memory locking and zeroization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of memory locking (mlock/munlock) and zeroization indicates security-conscious design. No hardcoded secrets are present; cryptographic operations seem standard. No suspicious network activity or code injections are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic file encryption/decryption with proper memory security measures, including zeroization and locking. It manages temporary directories safely, uses secure random data, and handles errors appropriately. The code's structure is clear and straightforward without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No anomalous or suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed for secure file encryption and decryption, with appropriate security practices such as key zeroization and memory locking. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no indications of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
