{
  "purpose": "This code performs file encryption and decryption using AES-GCM, manages system memory settings, creates temporary directories/files, and handles file hashing for integrity checks.",
  "sources": "Reads include files from disk ('read_file_in_chunks', 'hash_file'), environment variables (os.urandom), and user directories (Path.home()).",
  "sinks": "Writes encrypted/decrypted files to disk, modifies system process memory settings, and generates cryptographic keys in memory.",
  "flows": "Reads file data -> encrypts/decrypts in memory buffers -> writes output files; also reads environment entropy for key and buffer initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; uses standard cryptographic libraries and functions. Memory locking/unlocking for security is appropriate. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are detected. Directory and file management functions are standard. Use of platform-specific memory settings is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles cryptographic operations with proper memory management, including key locking and zeroization. It performs file hashing for integrity verification and manages temporary files/directories responsibly. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code's structure and functions align with standard encryption workflows, and no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of file encryption/decryption with proper security practices. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be intended for secure file handling with appropriate system and memory management.",
