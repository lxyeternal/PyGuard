  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the 'traittypes' module and version information from the '_version' module.",
  "sources": "Import statements, which load modules and symbols at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; these are static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can obscure which symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unnecessary code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from local modules: 'traittypes' and '_version'. The wildcard import makes it difficult to determine exactly which symbols are being imported from 'traittypes', which could be a concern if it contains malicious code. The '_version' import retrieves version information, a common practice. There are no network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The code itself is minimal and structurally simple, with no immediate indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple import statements with no clear malicious intent. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which can obscure imported content and potentially hide malicious or unwanted symbols, but there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this fragment.",
