  "purpose": "Import all traits from the traittypes module and version information from the _version module.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.traittypes' and '._version'. No external input data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; the code only performs imports without processing untrusted data or executing external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can be considered a coding practice concern but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from local modules, which is common in Python packages. The use of wildcard import may be stylistically discouraged but does not pose security risks. The imported modules relate to trait types and version info, which are typical for package metadata and type definitions. No suspicious code, malicious behavior, or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
