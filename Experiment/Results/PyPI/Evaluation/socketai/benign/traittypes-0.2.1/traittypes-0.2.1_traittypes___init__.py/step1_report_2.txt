  "purpose": "Import all traits from traittypes module and version information from _version module.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: traittypes and _version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; import statements do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports with wildcard (*) may obscure imported content but is common in package modules; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements: importing all symbols from a local module traittypes and specific version variables from a _version module. These actions are typical for setting up module dependencies and version info. There is no evidence of malicious code, dynamic execution, data handling, or other suspicious activity. The import pattern does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and typical for a Python package's internal module setup. No malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk is evident from these lines.",
