  "purpose": "Import all trait types and version information from local modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.traittypes and ._version).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from traittypes can obscure imported symbols, but this is not inherently malicious. Version info is imported for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import operations from internal modules. The use of relative imports and wildcard import suggests modular design but does not indicate malicious intent. No data is read from external sources, and no untrusted data is processed. There are no suspicious network or file operations, and no obfuscated code is present. Overall, this appears to be standard module initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data handling, network activity, or other suspicious operations.",
