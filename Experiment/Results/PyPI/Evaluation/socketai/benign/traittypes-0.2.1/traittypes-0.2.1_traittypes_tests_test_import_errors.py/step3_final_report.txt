  "purpose": "Test that _DelayedImportError raises RuntimeError when its asarray method is accessed, verifying delayed import error handling.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of _DelayedImportError object, access to its asarray method.",
  "sinks": "Calling asarray on _DelayedImportError, which triggers the RuntimeError as expected.",
  "flows": "Object creation of _DelayedImportError -> method call to asarray -> exception raised.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious data; straightforward test pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test designed to verify that _DelayedImportError raises RuntimeError upon accessing asarray. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The class _DelayedImportError is used for delayed import error handling, a common pattern. The test correctly expects an exception, and the code is simple and safe. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test for delayed import error handling with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk and malware scores are appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
