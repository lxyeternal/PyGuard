  "purpose": "Test function to verify that accessing a delayed import error raises a RuntimeError",
  "sources": "The instantiation of _DelayedImportError and the method call dummy.asarray([1, 2, 3])",
  "sinks": "The call to dummy.asarray([1, 2, 3]) could be a sink if it triggers untrusted code or leaks data, but here it only raises an error",
  "flows": "Instantiation of _DelayedImportError, then calling dummy.asarray which should raise RuntimeError",
  "anomalies": "The use of a custom error class _DelayedImportError and testing its behavior with a method call; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing utility 'nose.tools' and a class '_DelayedImportError' from a relative module. It defines a test that expects a RuntimeError to be raised when calling 'dummy.asarray()'. The test is straightforward and intended to validate error handling behavior. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of a private-like class name '_DelayedImportError' suggests internal implementation, but not malicious intent. No suspicious network or system activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple unit test verifying that a specific class raises an error as expected. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended for testing internal error handling.",
