{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test function to verify that accessing a delayed import error raises a RuntimeError.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'nose.tools' for testing and '_DelayedImportError' from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "The code uses the '_DelayedImportError' object, which is instantiated but only accessed to trigger an exception.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of '_DelayedImportError' followed by calling 'asarray' method, which is expected to raise an error.",
  "anomalies": "The '_DelayedImportError' is used to simulate delayed import failure; no secrets or malicious code are present. The test expects a RuntimeError upon attribute access.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing utility and a class intended for delayed import error handling. It defines a test function decorated to expect a RuntimeError, then creates an instance of '_DelayedImportError' and accesses 'asarray', which should trigger the error. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard test code for delayed import error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test designed to verify error handling for delayed imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It uses standard testing patterns and harmless constructs.",
