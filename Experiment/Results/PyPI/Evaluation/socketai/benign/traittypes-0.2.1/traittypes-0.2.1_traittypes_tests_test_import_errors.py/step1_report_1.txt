  "purpose": "Test that accessing a _DelayedImportError instance raises a RuntimeError.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of _DelayedImportError and access to its method 'asarray'.",
  "sinks": "Potential exception raising through 'dummy.asarray([1, 2, 3])'.",
  "flows": "Object creation of _DelayedImportError -> call to 'asarray' method.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom error class _DelayedImportError; no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. No suspicious data or environment variables involved.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing tools and a specific class _DelayedImportError. It defines a test function that verifies calling 'asarray' on an instance of _DelayedImportError raises a RuntimeError, as enforced by the nt.raises decorator. There is no indication of malicious behavior; the code appears to be a straightforward test case. The class _DelayedImportError's purpose seems to be to delay import errors until an attribute is accessed, which is a common pattern in Python. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple test verifying that _DelayedImportError raises RuntimeError when its method is accessed. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected. The code appears benign and intended for testing purposes.",
