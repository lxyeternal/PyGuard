  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with their descriptions. For Report 5, increasing the malware score slightly from 0.4 to approximately 0.6–0.65 is advisable to better reflect the suspicious features. Overall, the assessments effectively identify high suspicion in Reports 4 and 5, with no issues in reports lacking code."
