  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity detected. The primary concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which is common but should be trusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The security risk is minimal assuming the '_version.py' file is secure. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low."
