  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'traittypes' project, performing environment checks, collecting package data, and invoking setup.",

  "sinks": "Calls to setup() with package info; no untrusted data flows into dangerous functions.",
  "flows": "Reading '_version.py' and executing its contents via exec() as a source-to-sink path.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load '_version.py' which could be risky if the file is compromised, but is a common pattern in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment validation, collects package data, and invokes setup(). The only notable pattern is executing '_version.py' with exec(), which could execute malicious code if the file is tampered with. No network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup. The use of exec() is a known pattern but carries a slight security risk if the version file is compromised. Overall, the code appears benign and aligns with typical package distribution practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity detected. The primary concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which is common but should be trusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The security risk is minimal assuming the '_version.py' file is secure. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low.",
