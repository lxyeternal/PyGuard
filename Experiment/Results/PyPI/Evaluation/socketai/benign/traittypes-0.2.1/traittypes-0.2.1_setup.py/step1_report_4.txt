{
  "purpose": "This script is for setting up and configuring the packaging of a Python project named 'traittypes'.",
  "sources": "Reads the project's version from '_version.py', reads input arguments (sys.argv), and loads dependencies from 'scripts' directory and 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "Executes setup() to install packages, scripts, and dependencies; potentially writing files or installing code on the system.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> gathers files and dependencies -> calls setup() to install or build the package.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors. The version is dynamically loaded via exec(), which could be risky if '_version.py' is malicious but is typical for such scripts. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures, including version extraction, package discovery, dependency specification, and calling setup(). It includes a minimal Python version check, proper use of os and glob modules, and conditional import of setuptools. No suspicious or malicious logic detected; no hidden backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of exec() to load the version is common but can be risky if '_version.py' is malicious, though this is a known pattern in setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be well-structured for legitimate package configuration purposes.",
