      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity detected. The primary concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which is common but should be trusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The security risk is minimal assuming the '_version.py' file is secure. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of custom trait types for scientific data validation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is justified by dependency handling but does not indicate any threat. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscated score at 0. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."

      "conclusion": "The reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with their descriptions. For Report 5, increasing the malware score slightly from 0.4 to approximately 0.6–0.65 is advisable to better reflect the suspicious features. Overall, the assessments effectively identify high suspicion in Reports 4 and 5, with no issues in reports lacking code."
