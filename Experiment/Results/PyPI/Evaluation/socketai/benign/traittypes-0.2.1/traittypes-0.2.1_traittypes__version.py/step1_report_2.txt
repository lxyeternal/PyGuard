  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module as a string by joining version components.",
  "sources": "The 'version_info' tuple defined at the start of the code.",
  "sinks": "The '__version__' string assignment, which outputs the concatenated version string.",
  "flows": "The tuple 'version_info' is converted to strings and joined, then assigned to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and only sets version information.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple with version numbers, then creates a string '__version__' by joining the tuple elements with dots. There are no inputs from external sources, no data leaks, no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The code serves a common purpose of versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard version assignment snippet with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply formats version information.",
