  "sinks": "The code only creates a version string; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The tuple 'version_info' flows into the 'map' function, then joins into a string assigned to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a tuple 'version_info' with version components. It then converts each component to string and joins them with periods to create a version string assigned to '__version__'. There is no user input, external data, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply sets a package version string and does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues.",
