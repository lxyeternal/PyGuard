  "purpose": "Define the package version string from a tuple of version components.",
  "sources": "The tuple 'version_info' containing version numbers.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "The tuple 'version_info' is mapped to strings and joined to form '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a version string from a predefined tuple without external inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration snippet with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and their scoring is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
