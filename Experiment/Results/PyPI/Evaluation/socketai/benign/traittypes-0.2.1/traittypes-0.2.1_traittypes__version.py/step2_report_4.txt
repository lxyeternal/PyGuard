  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward version string assignment, with no external inputs, data sinks, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code snippet is standard practice for defining a package version.\n\n**Confirmation of code correctness:**\n- The original code correctly constructs a version string from a tuple `version_info` by mapping each component to a string and joining with periods.\n- No issues are present in the code logic or implementation.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Risk and malware justification:**\n- Since there's no malicious activity, no external data handling, and the code is simple, the risk score should remain at 0.\n- Malware score should also be 0, as no malicious code or behavior is present.\n\n**Potential assumptions or claims:**\n- No claims in the reports are based on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and match the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would agree with the existing scores: all zeroes, reflecting the benign nature of this code snippet.",
