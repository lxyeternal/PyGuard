  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package as a string by joining version tuple elements",
  "sources": "The tuple 'version_info' used to generate the version string",
  "sinks": "The assignment of the formatted version string to '__version__' (metadata variable)",
  "flows": "The tuple 'version_info' is converted to strings and joined, then assigned to '__version__'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string creation without hidden or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version_info tuple with three numeric components, then joins these components into a version string assigned to __version__. There are no external inputs, no dynamic or untrusted data sources, and no sensitive operations involved. The code appears to be a standard version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical version declaration without any malicious intent or security issues. It merely sets a version string for the package.",
