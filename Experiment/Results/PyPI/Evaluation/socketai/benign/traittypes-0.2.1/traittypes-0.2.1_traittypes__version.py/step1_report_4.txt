  "purpose": "Define the version string of the module based on a tuple of version components.",
  "sources": "The 'version_info' tuple provides the version components.",
  "sinks": "The '__version__' string could be used elsewhere for version checks or display, but does not directly lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The tuple 'version_info' is converted to strings and joined into '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward version string construction.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple with version numbers, then joins these numbers into a string assigned to '__version__'. This is a common pattern for managing package versions. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows from external inputs, and no use of insecure functions. The code is simple and standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version assignment snippet with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
