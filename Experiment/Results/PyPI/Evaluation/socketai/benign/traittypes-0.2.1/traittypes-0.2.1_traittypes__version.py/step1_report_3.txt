  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the tuple 'version_info' to generate the version string.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs a string using the 'join' and 'map' functions, but does not involve untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "The 'version_info' tuple flows into the 'map' function, which converts integers to strings, then into 'join' to create the version string.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets a version tuple and constructs a version string from it. No input is taken from untrusted sources, no external data is processed, and no malicious or suspicious actions are present. The structure is clear and typical for version handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only defining a version string based on a predefined tuple. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
