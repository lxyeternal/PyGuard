{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a POSIX message queue, registers it for reading events, and processes incoming messages by printing them. It then cleans up the queue.",
  "sources": "Reading from the message queue via `mq.receive()` within the `accept` callback.",
  "sinks": "Printing message content and priority to the console.",
  "flows": "Message queue receives data -> `accept` callback is triggered -> message and priority are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. Usage of `posix_ipc` for IPC is typical, and no external network connections or data exfiltration methods are present.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a POSIX IPC message queue, registers it with a selector for event-driven reading, and upon receiving a message, outputs the message and its priority. The code uses standard library functions and typical IPC mechanisms without any obfuscated or malicious code. No suspicious data flows or side-effects are evident, and the cleanup steps are standard. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of inter-process communication without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of IPC message queue handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
