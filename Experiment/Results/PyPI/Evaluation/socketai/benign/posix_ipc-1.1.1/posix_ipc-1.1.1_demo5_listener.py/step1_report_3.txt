{
  "purpose": "The code sets up an inter-process communication (IPC) message queue using posix_ipc and monitors it for incoming messages, printing received messages and their priorities.",
  "sources": "The message queue '/python_ipc_test' created with posix_ipc.MessageQueue and the receive() method called on it to read messages.",
  "sinks": "The receive() method acts as a sink where incoming data is handled and printed; however, it does not forward data elsewhere or store it insecurely.",
  "flows": "Messages are received from the message queue via mq.receive(), then printed to stdout. No data flows are directed outside the process or to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present. The code uses standard libraries and typical IPC patterns. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or unauthorized data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a POSIX message queue, sets it to non-blocking mode, and registers it with a selector for event-driven message handling. When an event occurs, the callback function 'accept' reads and prints the message and its priority. The code then cleans up by unlinking and closing the message queue. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The code performs straightforward IPC monitoring using standard libraries and methods.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a simple, standard IPC message queue listener without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious code elements and appears safe for use.",
