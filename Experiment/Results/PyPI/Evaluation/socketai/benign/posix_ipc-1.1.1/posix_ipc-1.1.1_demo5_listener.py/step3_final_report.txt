{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a POSIX message queue, registers it with a selector for event-driven message reception, prints incoming messages, and performs cleanup.",
  "sources": "posix_ipc.MessageQueue('/python_ipc_test') for message input; the receive() method within accept() as the data source.",
  "sinks": "print() function outputs the message content; potential data leakage if messages are untrusted, but no direct data exfiltration or malicious activity occurs.",
  "flows": "Messages are received via mq.receive() in accept(), then printed; no further data processing or external transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward use of standard libraries and IPC mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a non-blocking POSIX message queue, registers it with a selector for read events, and upon event detection, receives and prints messages. It then unlinks and closes the queue. No external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The message printing could be risky if messages are malicious, but the code itself is benign. The logic is standard and clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of IPC message queue listening, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score reflects potential concerns about untrusted message content, but the code's behavior itself is safe.",
