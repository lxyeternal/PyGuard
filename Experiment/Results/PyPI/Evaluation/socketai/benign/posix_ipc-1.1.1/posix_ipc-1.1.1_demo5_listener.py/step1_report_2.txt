{
  "purpose": "The code sets up an inter-process communication (IPC) message queue using posix_ipc and listens for incoming messages, printing them upon receipt.",
  "sources": "posix_ipc.MessageQueue('/python_ipc_test') creation, mq.receive() within accept() function",
  "sinks": "print statements displaying message content and priority",
  "flows": "mq.receive() (source) to print statements (sink), triggered by sel.select() event",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of standard libraries and IPC mechanisms is typical. No obfuscated code or unusual control flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a POSIX message queue, registers it with a selector for non-blocking I/O, and processes incoming messages by printing their contents and priorities. It then cleans up the message queue. All operations are standard IPC procedures with no evident malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The message handling is straightforward, with no external network activity or code injection points. The setup appears legitimate for inter-process communication without any malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard IPC message queue listener with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely receives and prints messages, and performs proper cleanup afterward. No indicators of malware or security issues are present.",
