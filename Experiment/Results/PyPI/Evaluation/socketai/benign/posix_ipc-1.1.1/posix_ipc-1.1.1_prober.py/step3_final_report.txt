{
  "purpose": "The code performs system environment detection, compiles and runs C snippets, queries system files, and generates a configuration header file. It is intended for system probing and diagnostics.",
  "sources": "Reads from system files (e.g., /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max), executes fixed shell commands via subprocess, reads a VERSION file, and compiles/runs C source files.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include subprocess calls with 'shell=True' and reading system files that could be manipulated if the environment is compromised.",
  "flows": "Source points include reading system files and executing subprocess commands; sinks are subprocess executions and file reads; flow is from system info sources through subprocess and file I/O to the output header and return values.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of subprocess with 'shell=True' is a concern but is controlled with fixed commands, minimizing risk.",
  "analysis": "The script is a system diagnostic utility that compiles and executes C code snippets, queries system parameters, and generates configuration headers. It uses subprocess calls with fixed commands, reducing risk but not eliminating it. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the subprocess usage, while not best practice, is controlled. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate system probing tool with no malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2) due to subprocess practices. Overall, it is safe for use in controlled environments.",
