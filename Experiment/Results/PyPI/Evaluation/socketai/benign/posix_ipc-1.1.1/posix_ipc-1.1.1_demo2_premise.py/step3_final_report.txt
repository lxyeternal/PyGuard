{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates inter-process communication using POSIX message queues, exchanging messages and verifying message integrity with MD5 hashes.",
  "sources": "Reads initial message from utils.read_params(), receives messages from the message queue mq.receive(), and uses utils.say() for output.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code processes messages received from the message queue, which are internally generated or received from other processes.",
  "flows": "Initial message sent (time string) -> received from mq -> verified against MD5 hash -> re-queued if identical -> message hashed with MD5 and sent back -> process repeats for specified iterations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Use of MD5 is outdated but not malicious in this context.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard IPC operations with message validation via MD5 hashes. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of MD5 is a known weakness but acceptable here for demonstration purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain tampering are present. The code structure is straightforward, and the logic is clear. The utils functions are assumed benign based on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of message passing with integrity verification. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
