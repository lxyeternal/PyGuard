  "purpose": "This script demonstrates inter-process communication using POSIX message queues, sending and receiving hashed messages, and performing basic message validation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from message queue (mq.receive()), reads parameters from utils.read_params().",
  "sinks": "Uses message queue (mq.send()) to send data; hashlib functions for hashing messages; utils.say() for output.",
  "flows": "Input from mq.receive() -> validation and hashing -> mq.send() -> repeated in loop.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data flows, no obfuscated code, no unusual system calls beyond normal IPC.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and a third-party module (posix_ipc) for message passing. Data is received from a message queue, validated via MD5 hash, and echoed back. The process repeats for a specified number of iterations. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code performs typical IPC with message validation. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise mechanisms are evident. The only potential concern is the use of MD5, which is insecure for cryptographic purposes, but here it is used for simple message validation, not security-critical operations. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign demonstration of message queue communication and message integrity verification. It does not contain malicious intent or suspicious behavior. Its security risk is minimal, mainly due to the use of MD5 for hashing, which is not ideal for cryptography but does not imply malicious intent.",
