  "purpose": "This script facilitates message passing between processes using POSIX message queues, performing iterative message exchanges with MD5 hashing for integrity verification.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters from utils.read_params(), and the message queue name from params['MESSAGE_QUEUE_NAME'].",
  "sinks": "Uses posix_ipc.MessageQueue to send and receive messages. Encodes and decodes message data for hashing and transmission.",
  "flows": "Reads input parameters -> creates message queue -> sends initial timestamp -> receives messages -> checks for message integrity -> hashes and sends back messages -> repeats for specified iterations -> destroys queue.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity, backdoors, or system modifications. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a message queue, sends an initial timestamp, and enters a loop to exchange messages that are validated via MD5 hashes. It uses standard libraries and straightforward logic without any suspicious data leaks, external network connections, or malicious behaviors. The use of hashlib for hashing is benign. No signs of backdoors, malicious payloads, or security flaws are present. The code appears to be a controlled message exchange simulation, not malware. The overall structure and flow are clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate message queue operations with integrity checks. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It appears to be a benign process for inter-process communication with proper cleanup. No security risks or malware concerns detected.",
