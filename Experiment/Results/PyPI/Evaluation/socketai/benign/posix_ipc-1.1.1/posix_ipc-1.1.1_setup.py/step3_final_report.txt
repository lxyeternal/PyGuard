  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring and building a C extension module, including environment detection for platform-specific dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'VERSION', reading long description from 'README.md', calling 'prober.probe()' for environment detection.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or sensitive information; the only external interaction is the system probe for build configuration.",
  "flows": "The system probe influences the 'libraries' list used during extension compilation, but no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'prober.probe()' for environment detection is typical; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks, reading static files and configuring extension modules based on environment detection. The 'prober.probe()' function's purpose appears benign, used for platform-specific library linking. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The fallback import of 'distutils' is common for compatibility. The overall structure and logic are straightforward and align with typical build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign package setup configuration with environment probing for cross-platform compatibility. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
