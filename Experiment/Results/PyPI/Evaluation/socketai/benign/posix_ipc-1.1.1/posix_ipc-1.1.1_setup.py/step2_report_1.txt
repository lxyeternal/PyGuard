  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the actual code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It performs standard setup tasks for a Python package, reading version info and description from local files.\n- It conditionally adds system libraries based on the output of `prober.probe()`.\n- It uses a try-except block to import either `setuptools` or `distutils`.\n- No user input, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.\n- The `prober.probe()` function's purpose appears to be environment detection for build configuration, not malicious activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Clear, confirms standard setup operations, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, notes standard practices, no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct; the code appears safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes system probing for platform compatibility, no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (slightly less, but still high)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Verdict:** The cautious note on `prober.probe()` is appropriate; it is likely benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to above, notes environment detection, no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (still low)\n- **Verdict:** Correct; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same general conclusion, emphasizing the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The only potential concern is the `prober.probe()` call, which could, in theory, collect system info. However, its use here appears solely for build configuration, not malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk between 0.1-0.2) are reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just due to system probing, which is standard in build scripts)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, legitimate Python package setup script. The use of system probing is common for cross-platform compatibility and does not constitute malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain low.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign supply chain component with minimal risk.",
