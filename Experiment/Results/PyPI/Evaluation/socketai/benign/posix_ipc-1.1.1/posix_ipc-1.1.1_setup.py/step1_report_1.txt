{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and configure a Python package named 'posix_ipc', including handling dependencies, reading version info, and defining build parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'VERSION' file; reads long description from 'README.md'; probes system configuration via 'prober.probe()' to determine platform-specific libraries.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data; no sensitive data is transmitted or stored; no network or external system interaction occurs.",
  "flows": "System probe results influence the 'libraries' list used during extension module setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to import modules based on availability is standard; no suspicious or obfuscated code observed; no hardcoded secrets or credentials present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup operations, including dynamic platform-dependent configuration based on system probes. It reads files for versioning and descriptions, and constructs extension modules accordingly. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It dynamically adapts to the environment to configure the build process but does not perform any suspicious actions.",
