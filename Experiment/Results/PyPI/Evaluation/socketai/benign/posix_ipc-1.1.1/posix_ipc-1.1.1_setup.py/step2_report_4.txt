  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the described logic, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with C extensions.\n- It reads version info and long description from local files.\n- It performs a system probe via `prober.probe()` to determine platform-specific libraries.\n- The `prober` module's behavior is not detailed but appears to be used for environment detection.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Finds no malicious behavior.\n- Confirms straightforward setup logic.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis is consistent with the code.\n- No issues identified.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard setup procedures.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly identifies no malicious activity.\n- The use of dynamic import fallback is standard.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Slightly more cautious, notes that `prober.probe()` could influence behavior.\n- Assigns a small security risk (0.1) due to the external probe.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The concern about `prober.probe()` is reasonable but not necessarily indicative of malicious intent.\n- The function's purpose appears to be environment detection for build configuration.\n- The risk score of 0.1 is justified given the external call, but no actual malicious activity is observed.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are reasonable and cautious.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to previous, emphasizes the benign nature.\n- Slightly higher security risk (0.2) due to reliance on an external probe.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The external probe's role is standard for cross-platform builds.\n- No suspicious behavior detected.\n- Slightly higher risk score is justified but still low.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n- Reiterates standard setup, with no suspicious activity.\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with the code.\n- No evidence of malicious intent.\n- The external probe's use is typical.\n\n**Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting cautiousness about the external probe, but overall low.\n\n---\n\n### **My final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package.\n- The `prober.probe()` function's purpose appears to be environment detection, common in build scripts.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are evident.\n- The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for external system probing, but very low)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The overall security posture of this script is very good. The only minor concern is the external `prober.probe()` call, but it appears benign and standard for cross-platform build configurations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1            |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the code's behavior.",
