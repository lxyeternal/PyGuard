  "purpose": "Demonstrates inter-process synchronization using POSIX semaphores in Python.",
  "sources": "Creates semaphore, spawns child process passing semaphore name, and manages acquire/release operations.",
  "sinks": "Semaphore acquire/release calls, subprocess invocation of 'child.py' with semaphore name.",
  "flows": "Parent creates semaphore -> passes semaphore name to child -> child waits on semaphore -> parent releases semaphore -> child proceeds.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward semaphore usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard example of IPC synchronization with POSIX semaphores. It creates a semaphore, spawns a child process passing the semaphore name, and coordinates access via acquire and release. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The 'child.py' script is not provided, but based on the parent code, it likely waits on the semaphore. The cleanup of the semaphore is correctly handled. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of IPC synchronization using POSIX semaphores. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities within this snippet. The potential risk depends on the behavior of 'child.py', which is not provided, but based solely on this code, the overall security posture is minimal.",
