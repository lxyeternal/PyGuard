{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the creation, synchronization, and cleanup of a POSIX semaphore across parent and child processes for inter-process communication.",
  "sources": "Reads process name (__file__), semaphore name (sem.name), and system commands executed via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "Uses the semaphore to coordinate process execution; outputs via print statements; attempts to recreate semaphore after unlinking.",
  "flows": "Parent creates semaphore -> passes semaphore name to child -> child waits on semaphore -> parent releases semaphore -> child proceeds -> parent unlinks semaphore.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard semaphore usage and process management. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a POSIX semaphore, spawns a child process passing the semaphore name, and uses the semaphore for process synchronization. It then cleans up by unlinking the semaphore. The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration of process synchronization with no malicious behavior or malicious payloads detected. It does not perform any network activity, data theft, or system manipulation beyond semaphore management. No anomalies or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of inter-process synchronization using POSIX semaphores. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and intended for process coordination demonstration.",
