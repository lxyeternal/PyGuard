{
  "purpose": "The code manages inter-process synchronization using POSIX semaphores, spawning a child process that waits on a semaphore created and managed by the parent.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine script directory, uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a child process with semaphore name, and interacts with the semaphore object.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are present; the code solely manages semaphore synchronization without data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Parent creates semaphore -> passes semaphore name to child -> child process waits on semaphore -> parent releases semaphore -> child proceeds and releases -> parent cleans up semaphore.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code uses standard Python modules and POSIX IPC. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of inter-process synchronization. It creates a POSIX semaphore, spawns a child process passing the semaphore name, then coordinates semaphore acquire and release calls between parent and child. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, code injection, or external communication. The code includes comments and normal semaphore handling, with no suspicious or anomalous patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of semaphore-based inter-process communication with no malicious intent detected. It functions as a demonstration of semaphore synchronization without any malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
