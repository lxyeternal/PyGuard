  "purpose": "Demonstrate creation, synchronization, and cleanup of a POSIX semaphore across parent and child processes.",
  "sources": "Semaphore creation with posix_ipc.Semaphore(None, ...), passing semaphore name to subprocess, reading comments about resource cleanup.",
  "sinks": "Semaphore operations (release, acquire, close, unlink), subprocess invocation.",
  "flows": "Parent creates semaphore -> passes name to child -> child waits and interacts with semaphore -> parent releases and cleans up semaphore.",
  "anomalies": "Comment about missing sem.close() in demos; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward IPC demonstration using POSIX semaphores. It creates a semaphore, spawns a child process passing the semaphore name, performs release and acquire operations, and cleans up resources. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious system calls are present. The comments acknowledge resource cleanup issues but do not indicate malicious intent. The external 'child.py' script is not analyzed but is typical in such demonstrations. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard example of inter-process synchronization using POSIX semaphores. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The low security risk score and zero malware score are appropriate. The resource cleanup comment does not imply malicious intent but indicates a minor resource management concern. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for educational purposes.",
