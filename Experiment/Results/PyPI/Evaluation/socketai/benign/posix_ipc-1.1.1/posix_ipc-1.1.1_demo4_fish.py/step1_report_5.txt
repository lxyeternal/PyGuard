{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates creation and synchronization of processes using POSIX semaphores, specifically for inter-process communication.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine script path; reads semaphore name when spawning child process.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.Popen to run external script (child.py); interacts with POSIX semaphore via posix_ipc.Semaphore methods.",
  "flows": "Creates semaphore -> spawns child process passing semaphore name -> parent releases semaphore after delay -> parent waits for child to release semaphore.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; comments indicate cleanup but do not show malicious intent; no unusual code patterns or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script correctly creates a POSIX semaphore and spawns a child process to interact with it, then properly releases and cleans up resources. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious system commands are present. The process flow is standard for IPC demonstrations. The only notable aspect is the reliance on an external 'child.py' script, but this is a common pattern in IPC demonstrations and not inherently suspicious. No hidden behaviors or malicious activities are evident. The code’s intent appears to be educational or demonstrative.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward demonstration of inter-process semaphore synchronization without any malicious behavior or security risks. It includes proper resource cleanup and no indications of sabotage or malware.",
