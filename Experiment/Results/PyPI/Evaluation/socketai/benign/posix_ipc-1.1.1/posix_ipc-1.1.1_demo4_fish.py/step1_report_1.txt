{
  "purpose": "Manage a POSIX semaphore for inter-process synchronization, spawn a child process that interacts with the semaphore, and clean up resources afterward.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ for script path; semaphore creation with posix_ipc.Semaphore; subprocess spawning to execute 'child.py'; reading and printing semaphore status.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no network or file writes involving untrusted data; semaphore cleanup and process control are standard.",
  "flows": "Parent creates semaphore -> spawns child process passing semaphore name -> parent releases semaphore -> parent waits for child to release semaphore -> cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious system calls observed. The code comments acknowledge resource cleanup but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard inter-process synchronization using POSIX semaphores, spawning a child process with the semaphore name passed as an argument. It includes proper semaphore cleanup procedures. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network or data leakage activities are present. The comments suggest awareness of resource management issues but do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious data handling are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate demonstration of POSIX semaphore usage for process synchronization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard pattern for inter-process communication and resource cleanup.",
