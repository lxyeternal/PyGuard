  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard example of inter-process synchronization using POSIX semaphores. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The low security risk score and zero malware score are appropriate. The resource cleanup comment does not imply malicious intent but indicates a minor resource management concern. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for educational purposes."
