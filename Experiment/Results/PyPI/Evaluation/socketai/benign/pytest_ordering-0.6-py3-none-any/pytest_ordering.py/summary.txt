  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test ordering utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It relies on internal pytest attributes, which is fragile but not malicious. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. Obfuscation is not present. The overall security risk score should be 0.1 to reflect fragility but not threat. The code is safe for use, with minor maintainability concerns."
