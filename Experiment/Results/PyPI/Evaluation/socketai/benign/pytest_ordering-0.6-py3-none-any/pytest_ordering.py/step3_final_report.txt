  "purpose": "Reorders pytest test items based on custom markers indicating order, using internal pytest attributes to determine the sequence.",
  "sources": "Reads test markers from internal pytest attributes (__dict__['_markers']) during test collection.",
  "sinks": "No external data or system actions; operates solely in-memory during test collection.",
  "flows": "Accesses internal marker data, matches markers with regex, and yields tests in specified order.",
  "anomalies": "Uses private pytest attribute (__dict__['_markers']), which is fragile and unconventional; incomplete handling of 'from_end' ordering (TODO comments).",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility for ordering pytest tests based on custom markers. It accesses internal pytest attributes, which could break if pytest internals change, but does not perform any malicious activity. No external communication, file operations, or data leaks are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the only concern is fragility due to reliance on internal APIs. The incomplete implementation (TODOs) indicates potential edge cases are not fully handled, but this does not impact security. Overall, the code is straightforward and benign, with a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test ordering utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It relies on internal pytest attributes, which is fragile but not malicious. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. Obfuscation is not present. The overall security risk score should be 0.1 to reflect fragility but not threat. The code is safe for use, with minor maintainability concerns.",
