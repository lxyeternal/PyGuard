{
  "purpose": "This code configures pytest test collection and ordering based on custom markers for test execution order.",
  "sources": "The code reads marker information from pytest test items during collection and modification phases.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the 'items' list in place to reorder tests; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or external process interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Marker data from test items flows into sorting logic which reorders tests based on specified order values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of pytest for test configuration is standard. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a mapping for order markers, registers a pytest configuration marker, and reorders test items during collection based on these markers. It uses standard Python constructs, no external untrusted input sources, and no network or file operations that could be malicious. The code only manipulates test orderings; there are no signs of malicious payloads or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest plugin setup for ordering test execution based on custom markers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured test configuration script.",
