{
  "purpose": "The code customizes pytest's test collection and ordering based on custom markers and predefined order mappings.",
  "sources": "The code reads test item markers using 'get_closest_marker' and accesses marker kwargs to determine order.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data affects the system or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Markers are retrieved from test items; these markers influence test ordering, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious functions, or obfuscated code are present. The code primarily handles test ordering logic.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a mapping of order labels to numeric positions, then registers and modifies pytest collection based on these markers. It assigns ordering to test items and sorts them accordingly, including grouping and sorting by positive and negative order values. No external inputs, network communications, or potentially malicious behaviors are observed. The code appears to be a standard pytest plugin extension for test ordering.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign pytest extension that manages test orderings via markers. There are no indications of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks present.",
