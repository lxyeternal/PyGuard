  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a pytest plugin that manages test execution order based on custom markers.\n- It imports standard modules (`operator`, `pytest`) and a local version module.\n- The logic involves assigning order markers, grouping tests, and sorting them accordingly.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or system modifications are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The code is consistent with typical pytest plugin patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code functions as a pytest plugin for ordering tests; it does not contain malicious payloads or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:** None detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None based on the provided code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The code appears correct and standard for its purpose.\n\n### Scoring justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Reasonableness of scores:\n- The scores assigned by all reports are consistent with the analysis: all indicate zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- Given the code's benign nature, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard pytest plugin for test ordering, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The reported scores are reasonable and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and benign.",
