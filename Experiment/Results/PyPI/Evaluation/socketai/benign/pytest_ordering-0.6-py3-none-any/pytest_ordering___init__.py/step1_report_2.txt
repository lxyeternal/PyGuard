  "purpose": "Configure pytest test collection and ordering based on custom markers.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local _version module, standard libraries, pytest framework, and a dictionary defining order markers.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data sources or sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a version import, imports necessary modules, sets up a mapping for test order markers, and modifies pytest's test collection based on these markers. It uses standard pytest marker handling and sorting logic. There are no indications of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The logic is straightforward and adheres to typical pytest plugin patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest configuration module for managing test orderings. It contains no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks are identified.",
