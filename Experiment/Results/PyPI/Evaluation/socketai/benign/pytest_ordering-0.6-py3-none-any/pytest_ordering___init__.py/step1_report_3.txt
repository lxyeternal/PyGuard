{
  "purpose": "This code configures pytest to order test execution based on custom markers, ensuring tests run in a specified sequence.",
  "sources": "The code reads marker information from pytest test items during collection and configuration phases.",
  "sinks": "No typical security-sensitive sinks such as network or file operations are present. The code primarily manipulates test metadata.",
  "flows": "Markers are read from test items; the order is determined based on marker names and associated values; test items are reordered accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns. The code solely handles test ordering logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pytest and operator modules, sets up a mapping for order indicators, and defines pytest hooks. It assigns 'run' markers with specific order values to test items based on their closest matching markers. Items are then grouped by order, sorted, and reordered within the pytest collection cycle. The logic is straightforward and focuses exclusively on test execution order management without any external data handling or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest plugin configuration for test ordering based on markers. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It functions solely within the testing framework for test execution sequencing.",
