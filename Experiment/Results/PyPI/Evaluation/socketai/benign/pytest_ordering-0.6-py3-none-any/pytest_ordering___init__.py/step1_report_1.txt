{
  "purpose": "This code configures and modifies the test collection order in pytest based on custom markers and predefined order mappings.",
  "sources": "Code reads marker data from test items during collection and configuration phases.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data processing beyond test marker handling.",
  "flows": "Markers on test items are read to determine order; data flows from item markers to test ordering logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. Usage of pytest and operator modules is standard for test configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal version info, operator, and pytest modules, and defines an order map for test sorting. It registers a pytest marker 'run' with descriptive documentation. The collection modification function assigns ordering markers to test items based on predefined order names, and then sorts items into start, middle, and end groups based on their order value, reconstructing the test collection order. No malicious code, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated logic present. All functions serve legitimate testing configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward pytest configuration for ordering tests based on custom markers, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a standard test setup script with no harmful behavior.",
