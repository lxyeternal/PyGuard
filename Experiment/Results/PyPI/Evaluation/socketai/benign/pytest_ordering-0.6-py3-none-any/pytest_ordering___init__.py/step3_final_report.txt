{
  "purpose": "This code is a pytest plugin that assigns execution order to tests based on custom markers and a predefined order map, then sorts the test items accordingly.",
  "sources": "The code reads marker data from test items via get_closest_marker and marker kwargs.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only manipulates test item ordering internally.",
  "flows": "Markers are read from test items, order values are assigned, and test items are sorted based on these orderings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a local version module, defines an order map for test markers, registers a pytest marker, and modifies the collection of test items by assigning order markers and sorting them accordingly. It operates solely within the test collection phase, with no external data handling, network activity, or system modifications. The logic is straightforward and adheres to standard pytest plugin patterns. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest plugin for ordering tests based on custom markers. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
