  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the package, indicating its current version.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external communication present.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward and standard code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. No input/output, data processing, or suspicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current assessment scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
