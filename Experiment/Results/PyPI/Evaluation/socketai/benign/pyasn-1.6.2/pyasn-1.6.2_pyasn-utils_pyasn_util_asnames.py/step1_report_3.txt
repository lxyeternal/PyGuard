{
  "purpose": "The script downloads, parses, and converts ASN names from an HTML webpage into a JSON format, allowing input from a local HTML file or fetching remotely.",
  "sources": "Input HTML file specified by '--html-input' or data fetched via URL from 'http://www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/autnums.html' using urlopen.",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON output to specified output file or printing to console; reading input HTML file; fetching data over the network.",
  "flows": "Input source (local file or network) -> processing functions (_html_to_dict, __parse_asname_line) -> output (file or console)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code; the code uses standard libraries, and the network operation fetches from a known URL without unusual patterns. No unusual dynamic execution or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, including regex, codecs, argparse, logging, and conditional import of json and urlopen based on environment. It fetches ASN data from a public URL or reads from a local HTML file, then parses HTML anchor tags matching a regex to extract ASN codes and names into a dictionary, then serializes to JSON. Network access is explicit and controlled, with no indication of malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The functions perform expected parsing and I/O operations. Overall, the code performs benign data fetching and processing with standard security practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign script designed for downloading and parsing ASN data from a trusted public URL or local HTML file, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It appears safe with no security risks identified.",
