{
  "purpose": "The script downloads, parses, and converts ASN names data from an HTML source into JSON format, with options for input/output files and caching the HTML.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a specified HTML file or fetches data from a remote URL using urlopen. It also reads and writes files if specified via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code writes JSON output to a specified file or prints it to the console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from either the input HTML file or remote URL through decoding and parsing functions, then is serialized into JSON and written to output or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The only network activity is fetching data from a legitimate-looking URL. No obfuscation or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard HTML fetching, parsing with regex, and JSON serialization. It uses proper encoding/decoding practices and provides command-line options. No malicious or suspicious activities such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for downloading and parsing ASN data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data processing script with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It operates within expected parameters for a downloader and parser tool. The overall security risk is low.",
