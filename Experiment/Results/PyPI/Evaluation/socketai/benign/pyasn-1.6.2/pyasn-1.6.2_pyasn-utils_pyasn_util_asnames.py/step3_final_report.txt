{
  "purpose": "The script downloads or reads ASN HTML data, parses it with regex, converts to dict and JSON, and outputs to file or console.",
  "sources": "Reads input HTML file or downloads data via urlopen from a trusted ASN data source.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON data to a file or stdout; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads data from file or network, parses with regex, converts to dict, serializes to JSON, then outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data fetching and parsing using standard libraries. It fetches ASN data from a legitimate URL or local file, parses HTML anchor tags with regex, converts data into a dictionary, serializes to JSON, and outputs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. Network activity is limited to a single, trusted URL. The code is simple, transparent, and aligns with benign utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign ASN data downloader and parser with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe, standard operation.",
