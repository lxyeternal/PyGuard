{
  "purpose": "The script downloads, parses, and converts ASN name data from an HTML webpage into a JSON format, optionally saving intermediate and final data to files or printing to console.",
  "sources": "Input data can come from a local HTML file specified by the user or fetched from a remote URL (http://www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/autnums.html).",
  "sinks": "The script writes output JSON data to a specified file or stdout; it reads input files if provided; it fetches data via HTTP(S) and performs file operations.",
  "flows": "Input source (local file or network fetch) → data processing functions → output file or console output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs standard data fetching, parsing, and output operations.",
  "analysis": "The code reads ASN data either from a local HTML file or from a remote URL, decodes and re-encodes character data, parses specific anchor tags with regex, and outputs JSON. No dynamic code execution, no use of untrusted input beyond normal network and file operations, and no suspicious data leaks or backdoors are present. The use of standard libraries and straightforward data processing indicates no malicious intent. The only network operation is a benign data fetch from a public URL. The code includes no hardcoded credentials or secret data.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs legitimate data fetching and parsing functions without any indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or supply chain threats.",
