{
  "purpose": "Download and parse ASN names from a remote HTML source or local input, convert to JSON, and output to console or file.",
  "sources": "Input HTML file specified by '-i' argument; data fetched from ASNAMES_URL via urlopen.",
  "sinks": "The data from URL is decoded and processed, but no untrusted input directly reaches critical sinks such as system commands or sensitive data storage.",
  "flows": "Input file or remote URL data -> decode -> parse lines -> convert to dict -> serialize to JSON -> output file or console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The URL fetching and decoding appear standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious network activity. No data exfiltration or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads either a local HTML file or downloads HTML content from a remote URL. It decodes the content from 'latin-1' to 'utf-8', then parses specific anchor tags to extract ASN data. The data is converted into a dictionary, serialized as JSON, and outputted. The code uses standard libraries with no apparent malicious functions, backdoors, or data leaks. The URL used is public and benign. No hardcoded secrets, no unsafe eval or dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility script for downloading and parsing ASN data. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The overall security risk is low.",
