  "purpose": "Assigns the version string for the package/module.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static assignment of a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a direct assignment of a version string, with no inputs, outputs, or external calls. It contains no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
