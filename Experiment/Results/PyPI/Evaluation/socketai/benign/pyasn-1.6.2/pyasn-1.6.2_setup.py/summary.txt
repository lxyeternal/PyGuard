  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with minimal security concerns. The main potential vulnerability is the use of exec() to load version info, which should be replaced with safer alternatives if security is paramount. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The current scores are appropriate, but awareness of the exec() pattern is advised."
