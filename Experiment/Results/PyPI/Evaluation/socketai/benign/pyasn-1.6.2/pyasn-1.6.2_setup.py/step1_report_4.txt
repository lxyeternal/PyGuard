  "purpose": "Setup script for the pyasn Python package, configuring build, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file, platform information, Python version info, glob for utils, and executes version file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the version file using exec(open(...)), potentially allowing arbitrary code execution if the version file is malicious.",
  "flows": "exec(open('pyasn/_version.py').read()) -> execution of external code; file reading operations for README.md and version file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from an external file ('_version.py') which could be malicious if the file is tampered with. No other suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that reads a README file, configures compilation extensions, gathers utility scripts, and executes a version file. The main concern is the use of exec() to run the contents of '_version.py', which could be malicious if the file is modified to include malicious code. Otherwise, the script appears typical for a package setup and does not exhibit malware or malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a typical setup configuration with a potential security risk stemming from executing external code via exec(). If '_version.py' is secure and controlled, the risk is minimal. However, the use of exec() should be reviewed for safety.",
