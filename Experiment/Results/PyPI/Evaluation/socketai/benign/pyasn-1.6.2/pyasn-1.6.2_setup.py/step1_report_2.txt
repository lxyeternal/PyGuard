{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pyasn Python package, used for IP-to-ASN lookup functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, executes version info from '_version.py', and dynamically gathers Python utility scripts from 'pyasn-utils'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; uses setup and import functions that are standard for package installation.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md and '_version.py' files, gathers utility scripts, then proceeds with package setup; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; straightforward setup procedure with dynamic version loading and conditional requirements based on system and Python version.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading files, setting extension modules, gathering dependencies, and configuring package metadata. It executes a version file to obtain '__version__' and dynamically includes scripts from a directory. All actions are typical for a setup.py and do not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, legitimate setup script for the pyasn package, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
