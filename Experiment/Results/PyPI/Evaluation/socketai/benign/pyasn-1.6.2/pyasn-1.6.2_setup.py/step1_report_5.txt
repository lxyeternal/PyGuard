  "purpose": "Setup script for the pyasn Python package, facilitating package configuration, compilation, and installation.",
  "sources": "Code reads system info, package files, version info, and dependency requirements.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data affects system or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Input sources include system info and file reads; flow ends at package setup and build processes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run code from 'pyasn/_version.py' can be risky if the file is compromised; otherwise, common in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: reading README, configuring extensions, collecting files, determining requirements based on Python version, and executing version info. It uses 'exec' to import version data, which is a common but slightly risky practice if the version file is maliciously modified. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious behavior is present. The code does not perform any runtime data processing or malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. The use of 'exec' to load version info is typical, though it warrants ensuring the version file is secure. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
