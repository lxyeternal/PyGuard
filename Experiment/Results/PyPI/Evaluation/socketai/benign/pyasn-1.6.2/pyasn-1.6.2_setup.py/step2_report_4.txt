  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior. The only concern is the use of `exec()` to load the version, which is common but could be risky if the version file is compromised.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe low malware score (0) is appropriate given no malicious activity. The securityRisk of 0.2 reflects the minor concern about executing external code. The confidence is high (0.9).  \n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward setup script with no suspicious behavior. The use of `exec()` is standard practice for version loading.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe zero scores for malware and obfuscated are justified. The securityRisk of 0 is appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script. No suspicious code or external data sinks. The use of `exec()` to load version info is standard but could be risky if the version file is tampered with.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis. The minor security risk score accounts for the `exec()` usage.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Findings:** The key concern is the use of `exec()` to run `_version.py`, which could be malicious if the file is compromised. The rest of the code is standard setup logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3\n\n**Assessment:**  \nGiven the potential risk of executing external code, a malware score of 0 seems optimistic. If the version file is compromised, malicious code could run.  \n**Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** Should be higher, perhaps around 0.4 or 0.5, to reflect the risk of executing external code.  \n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.3 is acceptable, but perhaps slightly higher, e.g., 0.4, considering the potential for malicious code execution.  \n**Conclusion:** The scores underestimate the risk here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, with standard setup code and use of `exec()` for version loading. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe low scores are justified, but again, the use of `exec()` warrants some caution.  \n**Verdict:** Slightly increase securityRisk to 0.2 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Recommendations:**\n\n- The main concern across these reports is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which can be risky if the version file is compromised.\n- The malware scores are currently zero, but in scenarios where `exec()` is used on external files, a non-zero malware score is justified, especially if the file's integrity isn't guaranteed.\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Considering the potential for malicious code execution via `exec()`, I would assign a malware score around **0.4** to **0.5** for reports that use `exec()` on external files.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports show clear, straightforward code, so **0** remains appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher than the current for reports with `exec()`, around **0.3** to **0.4**, reflecting the potential risk.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe setup scripts are standard and benign in typical circumstances. The main security concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which should be replaced with safer alternatives (e.g., importing the version as a module or reading it as a string). The current scores underestimate the potential risk associated with executing external code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Increase malware scores to approximately **0.4–0.5** for reports involving `exec()`.  \n- Keep obfuscated at 0.  \n- Adjust securityRisk to around **0.3–0.4** accordingly.\n\nThis careful review suggests that while the code appears benign, the method of loading version info could pose a security risk if not properly managed.",
