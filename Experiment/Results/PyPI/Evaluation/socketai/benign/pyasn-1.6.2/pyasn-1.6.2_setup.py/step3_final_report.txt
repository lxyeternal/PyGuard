{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'pyasn' Python package, configuring extension modules, dependencies, and package metadata, including dynamic version loading.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, gathering utility scripts, executing 'pyasn/_version.py' via exec()",
  "sinks": "exec() executes external code from '_version.py', which could be a security concern if the file is compromised",
  "flows": "Reading version file -> exec() executes version code",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version information from an external file, which could be malicious if the file is tampered with",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks with no malicious payloads. The primary concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which is common but can be risky if the version file is compromised. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk around 0.2-0.3) are consistent with the code's behavior. The risk stems from executing external code during setup, but in controlled environments, this is generally acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with minimal security concerns. The main potential vulnerability is the use of exec() to load version info, which should be replaced with safer alternatives if security is paramount. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The current scores are appropriate, but awareness of the exec() pattern is advised.",
