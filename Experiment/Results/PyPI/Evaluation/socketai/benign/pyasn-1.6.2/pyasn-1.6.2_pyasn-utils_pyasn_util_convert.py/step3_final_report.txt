  "purpose": "A command-line utility for converting MRT/RIB archive files into IPASN databases, supporting single, bulk, and screen dump operations with optional gzip compression.",
  "sources": "Input MRT/RIB files specified via command-line arguments, globbed files in bulk mode, and external 'pyasn.mrtx' library functions for parsing and dumping data.",
  "sinks": "File output for prefixes, standard output for dump screen, subprocess call to 'gzip' for compression.",
  "flows": "Input files are read by 'pyasn.mrtx' functions; data is processed and written to output files; optional compression via subprocess call; command-line arguments control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; subprocess call to 'gzip' is standard but could be risky if input filenames are manipulated, though in this context it is controlled.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward data processing utility that relies on trusted external libraries and standard system calls. It does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. The subprocess call for gzip compression is typical and safe in controlled environments. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential minimal risks associated with external command execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source MRT/RIB processing utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain threats. The low risk score is justified given the controlled use of subprocess for compression. Overall, it is safe for use in standard environments.",
