  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the script's function and input sources.\n- **Targets & Flows:** Correctly identifies file handling and external library usage.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the subprocess call with 'gzip' but considers it standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and external libraries are trusted. The risk score is 0.2, which seems reasonable given the limited attack surface.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to subprocess call, but acceptable in controlled context)\n\n**Verdict:** The report's scores and reasoning are sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing legitimate file processing and standard system calls.  \n- The confidence is slightly high, and the malware score remains 0.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, similar findings. Focuses on the safe use of external libraries and system calls.  \n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same conclusion: legitimate utility, standard external calls, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (slightly lower, reflecting minimal concern)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with previous reports; no suspicious behavior, standard use of subprocess, no obfuscation.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting low security risk due to external subprocess calls, but these are standard and controlled.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk:** Approximately 0.1 — 0.2, consistent with the reports, considering standard subprocess usage and external library reliance.\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns well with the code's actual behavior. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for processing MRT/RIB data, with no evident security threats or malicious intent.",
