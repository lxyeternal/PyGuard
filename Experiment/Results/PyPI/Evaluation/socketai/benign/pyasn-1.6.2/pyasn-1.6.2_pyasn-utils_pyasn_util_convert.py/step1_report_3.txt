{
  "purpose": "The script converts MRT/RIB archive files into IPASN databases, providing options for single file conversion, screen dumping, or bulk processing over date ranges.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments (via argparse), files from the filesystem (glob), and inputs from specified MRT/RIB archive files.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes output files (prefix data and logs), executes system commands (gzip compression), and reads MRT/RIB archive data, which could be exploited if files are malicious.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments influences file processing; files are read with mrtx.parse_mrt_file; output is written via mrtx.dump_prefixes_to_file; system commands are executed for compression.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs legitimate file processing tasks. Usage of subprocess.call with 'gzip' is standard for compression.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs argument parsing, file handling, and invoking functions from the 'pyasn' library to process MRT/RIB data. There are no signs of malicious code or obfuscated behavior. The subprocess call for gzip is standard for compression, not suspicious. The only external activity involves file reading, writing, and optional compression. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. All functionalities seem aligned with legitimate data processing. The library functions are assumed safe; the script does not manipulate untrusted data beyond standard file I/O.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data conversion tool for MRT/RIB archive processing. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It leverages standard libraries and system calls for compression, with no suspicious patterns. Overall security risk is low.",
