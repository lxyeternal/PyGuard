      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with minimal security concerns. The main potential vulnerability is the use of exec() to load version info, which should be replaced with safer alternatives if security is paramount. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The current scores are appropriate, but awareness of the exec() pattern is advised."

The overall security risk is negligible, and the code can be considered safe after correcting the 'path.splitext()' call."

The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are appropriate. The security risk score should remain low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting operational concerns rather than actual vulnerabilities."

The low risk score is justified given the controlled use of subprocess for compression. Overall, it is safe for use in standard environments."

The only minor security issue is the use of eval() on static files, which could be exploited if files are tampered with. Scores are appropriate: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.2. It is recommended to replace eval() with a safer parser like ast.literal_eval() to mitigate this concern."
