  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, open-source data downloader for BGP archives. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are appropriate. The security risk score should remain low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting operational concerns rather than actual vulnerabilities."
