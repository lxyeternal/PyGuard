{
  "purpose": "The script downloads BGP MRT/RIB data from RouteViews via FTP or HTTP, based on user options.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, FTP server responses, and HTML content from web pages.",
  "sinks": "Writes downloaded files to disk, invokes external 'wget' commands for downloads.",
  "flows": "Command-line args determine download method -> FTP or HTTP request -> file write or external command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'subprocess.call' with 'wget' could be exploited if inputs are manipulated; fragile HTML parsing; broad exception handling for optional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs public data retrieval via FTP and HTTP, with standard libraries. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. The use of external 'wget' commands introduces a minor security concern if inputs are compromised, but in controlled environments, this is typical. HTML parsing is fragile but not malicious. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The exception handling suppresses errors but does not hide malicious activity. Overall, the script is a legitimate utility with minimal security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, open-source data downloader for BGP archives. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are appropriate. The security risk score should remain low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting operational concerns rather than actual vulnerabilities.",
