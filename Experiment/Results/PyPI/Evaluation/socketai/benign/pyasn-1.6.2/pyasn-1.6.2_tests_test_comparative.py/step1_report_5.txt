{
  "purpose": "This code performs testing and validation of IP-to-ASN mappings using the pyasn library, comparing results against static data from Cymru-whois and previous versions of pyasn for consistency and correctness.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static files: '../data/cymru.map' (reads and evals as a Python dict), gzip-compressed pickle files for ASN mappings, and IP addresses from the test data files.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted data for security effects or data leaks. It performs only read operations and assertions; no data is transmitted, stored insecurely, or used maliciously.",
  "flows": "The code reads static data files (cymru.map, pickle.gz) into memory, performs lookups via pyasn, and compares the results to expected values. No untrusted input flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns. The use of eval on the contents of 'cymru.map' is potentially unsafe in untrusted contexts but appears intended for controlled test data. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a test suite for validating the pyasn library's ASN lookups against known static datasets. It loads static data files, performs IP-to-ASN lookups, compares the results, and logs discrepancies. The use of eval on a static resource is a minor concern but not malicious. There is no network activity, data leakage, or malicious code; the code functions solely for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for ASN lookup validation with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. Its operations are read-only and solely aimed at correctness verification. No malware or security risks are detected.",
