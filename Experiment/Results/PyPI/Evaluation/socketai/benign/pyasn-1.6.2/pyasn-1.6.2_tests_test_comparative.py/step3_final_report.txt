{
  "purpose": "The code implements unit tests for ASN lookup validation using static datasets, verifying correctness and compatibility of the pyasn library against known reference data.",
  "sources": "Reads static data files ('cymru.map' and pickle gzip files) from local filesystem; performs ASN lookups via pyasn library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external system interactions; no data leaks or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Reads static files -> parses data (via eval or pickle) -> performs ASN lookups -> compares results for correctness.",
  "anomalies": "Uses eval() to parse 'cymru.map', which is unsafe if files are tampered with; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward testing suite verifying ASN lookup correctness and compatibility. The only security concern is the use of eval() on static files, which could execute malicious code if files are compromised. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code does not perform network activity or dynamic code execution beyond eval(). The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting code clarity. The security risk score is approximately 0.2, accounting for the eval() usage, which is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, the code is benign, with a small security caveat related to static file parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing suite for ASN lookups with no malicious behavior. The only minor security issue is the use of eval() on static files, which could be exploited if files are tampered with. Scores are appropriate: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.2. It is recommended to replace eval() with a safer parser like ast.literal_eval() to mitigate this concern.",
