{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the correctness and compatibility of the pyasn library for ASN lookups against known datasets.",
  "sources": "Reads static ASN data from files: IPASN_DB_PATH (gzip compressed database), STATIC_CYMRUWHOIS_PATH (text file with a mapping), and STATIC_PYASNv12_PATH (gzip compressed pickle).",
  "sinks": "Uses the lookup method of pyasn, which could potentially process untrusted IPs, but in this context, all inputs are static files, not user inputs.",
  "flows": "Reads static files -> processes IP addresses -> performs ASN lookups via pyasn -> compares results with stored data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code activities. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of eval() on static file content is generally discouraged but is not inherently malicious in this context, as the data is assumed trusted.",
  "analysis": "The script loads datasets and performs validation tests to compare ASN lookups. It reads data from local files, including gzipped pickle files and text maps. The eval() function is used to parse the cymru map file, which is a potential security concern if input is untrusted, but here it operates on static, local, and trusted data. No network connections, system modifications, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be for testing and validation purposes only, with no malicious intent. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing suite focused on validating ASN lookup accuracy. It does not contain malicious code, malware, or suspicious activities. The eval() usage warrants caution but is not malicious in this context. Overall security risk is low.",
