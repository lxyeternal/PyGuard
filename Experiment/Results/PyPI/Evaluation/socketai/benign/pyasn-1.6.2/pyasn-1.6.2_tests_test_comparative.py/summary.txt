  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing suite for ASN lookups with no malicious behavior. The only minor security issue is the use of eval() on static files, which could be exploited if files are tampered with. Scores are appropriate: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.2. It is recommended to replace eval() with a safer parser like ast.literal_eval() to mitigate this concern."
