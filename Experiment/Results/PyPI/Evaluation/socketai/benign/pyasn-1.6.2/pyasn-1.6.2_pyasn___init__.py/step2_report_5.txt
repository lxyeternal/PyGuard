  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a class for ASN/IP lookups, loads data from files, no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior. The report concludes the code is legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The only minor concern could be the handling of file inputs, but it appears standard and safe.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are reasonable.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above; loads ASN/IP data, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No malicious actions, no network activity, standard data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe risk score of 0.2 is slightly elevated but still low, considering the code's nature. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The minor risk could be due to handling external files, but this is typical.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; ASN/IP lookup utility, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, network communication, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code's behavior. The low risk score reflects typical data handling without malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are reasonable.** No change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard ASN/IP lookup class, loads data, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no network or system command execution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe assessment is consistent. The code is straightforward, with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.** No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; a utility for IP/ASN lookup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No network activity, code injection, or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll observations align with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are justified.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware=0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.2), reflecting minimal concern over file handling, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- The code is a legitimate ASN/IP address lookup utility.\n- No signs of malicious modification, obfuscation, or malicious data flows.\n- The handling of files, including gzip and JSON, is standard and safe.\n- The functions perform expected data processing without external network activity or code injection.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (a very low, conservative risk score reflecting typical file handling but no real concern)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior. The provided reports are consistent with this assessment. I recommend maintaining the current scores, with a slight adjustment to the risk score to reflect minimal concern.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1",
