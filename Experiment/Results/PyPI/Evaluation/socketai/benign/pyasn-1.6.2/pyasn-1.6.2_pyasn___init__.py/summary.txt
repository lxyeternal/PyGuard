  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate ASN/IP lookup utility with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The only issue is a minor bug in filename extension handling. The overall security risk is negligible, and the code can be considered safe after correcting the 'path.splitext()' call."
