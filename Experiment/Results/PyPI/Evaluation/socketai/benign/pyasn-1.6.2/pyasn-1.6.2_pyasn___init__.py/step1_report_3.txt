{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for IP-ASN lookups and related network information management, including loading databases, querying ASN data, and converting ASN formats.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include files (possibly compressed or JSON formatted) for IP-ASN databases and ASN names, as well as IP addresses passed to the lookup method.",
  "sinks": "Data is returned via methods, and certain methods perform data transformations and lookups; no direct sinks for untrusted data lead to system commands, network, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Input data (files, IP addresses) flows into parsing and lookup functions; data is processed within class methods; no untrusted data is forwarded to external sinks such as network or shell commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code performs standard network data processing, with no obfuscated code, suspicious URL accesses, or system command executions. Exception handling is straightforward. The code reads external files and processes ASN/IP data but does not perform any malicious actions during this process.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of IP address and ASN lookup functionality using a radix tree structure. It loads data from files (including gzip compressed files), processes ASN data, converts ASN formats, and performs network prefix calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system exploitation. The only potentially suspicious aspect is extensive data handling, but all operations are standard for such a network info library. No obfuscation, no code injection, and no suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate network data lookup library with no malicious intent or behavior. It provides useful ASN/IP lookup functions and handles data securely without performing any harmful actions. No malware or malicious code is detected.",
