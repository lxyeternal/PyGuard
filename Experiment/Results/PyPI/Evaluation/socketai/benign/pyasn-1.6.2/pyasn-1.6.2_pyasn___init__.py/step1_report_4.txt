{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python class 'pyasn' for performing IP-to-ASN lookups and related network analysis functions using radix trees and database files.",
  "sources": "Reads data from IP-ASN database files (.gz, .json, or plain text), optional ASN name files (.gz, .json). Uses file I/O, gzip, and JSON parsing to load data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data inputs for executing commands, network communication, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (sources) into in-memory data structures for lookup operations; no flow leads to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The only notable feature is the conversion functions for ASN formats, which are benign. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no network connections or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads and processes IP-ASN data and ASN names from files, constructs radix trees for fast lookup, and provides methods for retrieving ASN info, prefixes, and address space calculations. The data loading mechanisms include support for gzip and JSON formats. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. It does not interact with external systems beyond file reading and data processing, and it does not execute untrusted code. There are no hidden or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of an IP-ASN lookup utility, with no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It securely loads data and provides lookup functions without executing external or untrusted code. No malware or security risks are identified.",
