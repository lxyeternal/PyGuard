  "purpose": "Setup script for a package named 'jsonify' that converts CSV files to JSON format.",
  "sources": "Code reads static package metadata, including name, version, packages, description, author info, license, and keywords.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no input/output or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard setup function with hardcoded metadata. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration using distutils to package a Python project. It only contains static strings and package information without any user input, environment variable usage, or external data fetching. There are no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials beyond package info, or malicious code. The content appears typical for a Python package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign packaging configuration.",
