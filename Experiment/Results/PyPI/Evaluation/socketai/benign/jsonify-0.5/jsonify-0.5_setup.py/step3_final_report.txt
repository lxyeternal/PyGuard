  "purpose": "Package setup script for a Python project, defining metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, author, description, keywords, license.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, external data handling, or dynamic execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static metadata used solely for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'distutils.core' and defines package metadata. It contains no input/output operations, no dynamic code, no external data fetching, and no embedded secrets. The use of 'distutils' is deprecated but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
