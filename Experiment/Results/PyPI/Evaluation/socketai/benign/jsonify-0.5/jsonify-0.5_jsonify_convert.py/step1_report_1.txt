  "purpose": "Convert a CSV file into a formatted JSON file",
  "sources": "Reads the CSV file specified by the 'csv_name' parameter using open() and csv.DictReader",
  "sinks": "Writes JSON data to a file with the same base name but with a .json extension",
  "flows": "open() reads CSV file -> csv.DictReader processes rows -> json.dumps converts data to JSON string -> write() saves JSON to output file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; code performs straightforward file processing",
  "analysis": "The code opens a CSV file for reading, reads its content into a list of dictionaries, then writes the JSON representation to a new file with a similar name. There are no obfuscated or malicious constructs, no network activity, or hidden data exfiltration. It appears to be a simple data transformation utility.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions solely as a CSV to JSON converter with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
