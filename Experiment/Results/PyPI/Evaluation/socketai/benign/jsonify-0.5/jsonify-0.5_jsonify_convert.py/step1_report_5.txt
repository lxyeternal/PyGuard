  "purpose": "Convert a CSV file into a formatted JSON file.",
  "sources": "Reading the CSV file specified by the parameter 'csv_name'.",
  "sinks": "Writing the JSON output to a file derived from the CSV filename.",
  "flows": "Read CSV data from the file; store rows in a list; write JSON data to a new file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code straightforwardly converts CSV to JSON without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a CSV file provided as input, loads its data into a list of dictionaries, and writes the data as a JSON file with a similar name but a different extension. No external network connections, no use of environment variables, and no execution of untrusted code. The filename manipulation is simple string slicing to replace the extension, which is standard. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs a standard CSV to JSON conversion with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
