  "purpose": "Convert a CSV file into a formatted JSON file",
  "sources": "Reads input filename from function argument, opens the specified CSV file",
  "sinks": "Writes JSON data to a new file with a modified filename",
  "flows": "Open CSV file -> Read data -> Convert data to JSON -> Write JSON to new file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a CSV file specified by the parameter 'csv_name', loads its content into a list of dictionaries, and writes the serialized JSON to a new file with the same base name but a 'json' extension. It performs standard file I/O and JSON serialization without any user input validation, environment variable usage, or external network connections. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code injections are present. The code structure is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple CSV to JSON converter with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe for typical use, assuming the input CSV files are from trusted sources.",
