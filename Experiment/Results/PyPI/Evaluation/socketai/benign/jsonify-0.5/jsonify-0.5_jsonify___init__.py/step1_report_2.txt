{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and potentially network communication, likely for legitimate purposes such as data collection or reporting.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and function parameters; no direct untrusted input appears to be read from files or network sockets.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests (e.g., sending data over HTTP), execution of system commands, or writing to files. Specific lines or functions are not explicitly provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables or parameters) through processing functions to sinks such as network communication or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or unusual obfuscation observed. Code structure appears standard; no clear backdoors or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly at all stages. It uses standard library functions and common patterns without signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. No evidence of malware behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or cryptomining was found. The security risk appears minimal, and no malicious activity is suggested by the code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve legitimate functions, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
