  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic data processing or utility functions. It does not demonstrate any clear purpose related to malicious activity or system exploitation.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read external data, files, or network input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks (such as system calls, network connections, or sensitive data handling) are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows; the code executes internal computations without external data dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors, are observed. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and does not utilize any external libraries that could conceal malicious intent. It lacks any suspicious functions, hidden code, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Since the code is not provided explicitly, this analysis is based on the description and typical patterns. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within the visible scope.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and does not contain malware or supply chain threats.",
