{
  "purpose": "The code is intended for standard data processing or utility functions with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input parameters, standard library functions, external modules.",
  "sinks": "Network calls, file system operations, system commands, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment or parameters flows into processing functions, potentially leading to network requests or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate the code is straightforward, with no malicious indicators or obfuscation. High confidence (0.9) in reports with code visibility supports the low malware (0) and obfuscation (0) scores. Limited or absent code results in low confidence (0.2-0.3), but no anomalies are observed. The security risk score of 0.2 is consistent across reports, reflecting minimal potential risk. The reasoning aligns with the absence of suspicious activity, and the scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the comprehensive review, the code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the confidence levels reflect the available information. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
