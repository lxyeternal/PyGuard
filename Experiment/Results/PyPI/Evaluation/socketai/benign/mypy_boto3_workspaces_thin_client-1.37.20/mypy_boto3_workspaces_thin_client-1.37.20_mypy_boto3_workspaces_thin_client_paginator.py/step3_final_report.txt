  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for workspaces-thin-client service client paginators.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, method signatures accepting kwargs, and type annotations; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Methods accepting kwargs and returning PageIterator objects; no untrusted data processing or network activity within the code.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into 'paginate' methods, which invoke underlying paginator logic; no data leaks or external effects in static code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard, boilerplate-like, providing type annotations and class hierarchies for boto3 paginators. It uses conditional imports for compatibility and defines 'paginate' methods that delegate to boto3's paginator. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The 'paginate' methods may perform network requests at runtime, but this is typical for SDK wrappers and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginators, with no malicious or security risks evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: near zero) are appropriate. High risk scores in some reports are overestimations given the static, structural nature of the code.",
