  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data handling.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- The only potential concern could be the future copyright year (2025), but this is not malicious—just a detail.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a package setup.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No untrusted data or data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurately states the script is standard, benign, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly describes the static nature.\n- **Sinks & anomalies:** No issues.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Properly states the script is benign, standard setup code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — slightly above zero, but considering the overall benign assessment, this is acceptable.\n\n**Note:** The securityRisk is minimal, perhaps due to the environment or general caution, but no actual risk exists.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurate, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Appropriately states the script is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly states the script is standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — fitting.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the descriptions; no malicious or suspicious code is present.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), likely reflecting cautious default or minor uncertainty, but no actual security risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, should be **0** or possibly **0.1** if minor caution is warranted, but not higher.\n\n**Justification:** The code is a standard, static setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external untrusted data. The minimal risk score (0.1) in some reports is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Suggested Value | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                       | No malicious code or behavior present.                          |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.               |\n| Security Risk    | 0                       | No security risks identified; setup script is benign.          |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The scores are appropriate, with no need for concern.",
