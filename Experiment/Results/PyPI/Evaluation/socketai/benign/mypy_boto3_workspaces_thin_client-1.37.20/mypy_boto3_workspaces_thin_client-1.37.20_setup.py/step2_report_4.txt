  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior. Reads README.md, no untrusted data, no code execution, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5 (noted as 0, but possibly slightly elevated due to environment variable dependency), confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious or suspicious activity is present. The environment variable dependency for conditional dependencies is common and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard setup script, reads local files, no untrusted data, no external calls, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low), confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the above. The slight securityRisk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the minimal potential for issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a straightforward package setup with no suspicious code, no external data, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious behavior, no external or untrusted data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—static, standard package setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree the code is free of malicious activity. I concur with a malware score of **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree. I assign **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** All assessments are low, with some mentioning minimal security risk due to dependency conditions. I agree with a **risk score of 0** or very close to it.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical, static setup script for Python packaging.\n- No external untrusted data sources, no code injection, no network activity.\n- Dependency management and file reading are standard and safe.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Therefore, my estimated scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of all reports and the detailed reasoning above.",
