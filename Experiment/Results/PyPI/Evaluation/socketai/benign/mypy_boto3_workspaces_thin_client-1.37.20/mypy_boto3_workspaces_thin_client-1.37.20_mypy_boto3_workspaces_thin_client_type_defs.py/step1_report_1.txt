{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the workspaces-thin-client service API, facilitating type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys.version_info, standard library modules (sys, datetime), local literals, and type definitions; all are for type annotations and do not handle untrusted data directly.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data leading to security effects; the code mainly declares types and does not perform data processing or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could cause vulnerabilities; type definitions serve as schemas without data manipulation or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is purely declarative, focusing on type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes data type definitions for a client SDK, using TypedDict and conditional imports based on Python version. It imports necessary modules, defines various structured data types for API requests and responses, and does not process untrusted input or perform network operations. There are no indications of malicious logic, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling. The code is straightforward, serving as a schema for data validation and type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type definitions for a client SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. It functions as a static schema for API data, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
