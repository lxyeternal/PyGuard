  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code is a set of static type definitions using `TypedDict` and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n   - It does not process untrusted data, perform I/O, network operations, or contain executable logic.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The purpose is purely to define data schemas for an SDK.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, with a malware score of 0, and no security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static, declarative, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in their assessments.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, transparent nature of the code.\n   - The overall security risk is rated as 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:\n   - Since the code is purely static type definitions with no runtime or external data handling, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent justify a risk score above 0.5.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain payloads.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified and should remain.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports base their conclusions on the static, declarative nature of the code.\n   - There are no unwarranted assumptions; the analysis is consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's static, schema-only purpose.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious code or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear, straightforward, and transparent.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified; purely static type definitions.\n\n### **Summary:**\nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for a Python SDK. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \n**No security concerns or malicious activity detected.**",
