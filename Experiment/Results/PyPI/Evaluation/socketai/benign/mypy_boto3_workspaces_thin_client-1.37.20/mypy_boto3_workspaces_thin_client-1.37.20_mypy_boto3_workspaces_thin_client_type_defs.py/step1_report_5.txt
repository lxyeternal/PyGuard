  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the workspaces-thin-client service API, facilitating type checking and structured data handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for system version checks, type imports, and type definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is processed or output to external systems within this code.",
  "flows": "The code solely defines types and does not include any data flow or logic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict class definitions, conditional imports based on Python version, and type aliases. It imports type-related modules and defines data structures for API request/response schemas. No runtime logic, input/output handling, or external communication is present. The import of future annotations and version-dependent typing imports are standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code is purely declarative for type checking, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward type definition module for an API client, with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
