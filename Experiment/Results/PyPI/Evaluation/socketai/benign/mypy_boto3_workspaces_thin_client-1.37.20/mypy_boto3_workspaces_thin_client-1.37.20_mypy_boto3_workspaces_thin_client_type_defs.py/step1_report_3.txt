  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the workspaces-thin-client service API.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines data types and imports libraries based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no external data processing or output actions.",
  "flows": "The code is purely structural, defining type annotations without runtime data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behavior. Usage of standard libraries and conditional imports is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions using TypedDict for various request and response structures, importing necessary modules based on Python version. It does not contain executable logic or runtime data handling. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The structure is straightforward, adhering to standard typing practices for API schemas. No suspicious code constructs, obfuscation, or dynamic execution found. The import of 'sys' for version checks and conditional imports is standard and not malicious. Overall, the code is purely structural with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type definition module for API request/response structures. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as a static typing aid without runtime execution or external data handling.",
