  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of static type definitions for a Python SDK, using TypedDict and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- There are no runtime operations, data processing, network calls, or handling of untrusted input.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The malware score assigned in all reports is 0, which aligns with the code's static and declarative nature.\n- The security risk is also correctly assessed as negligible (0).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely declarative; no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n   - The type definitions serve as static schemas for data validation and documentation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code only defines types and imports, with no data handling or external interactions.\n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious or malicious logic.\n   - The reasoning is consistent: no runtime code, no data flows from untrusted sources, no obfuscation.\n\n3. **Scores for Malware, Obfuscation, and Risk:**\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscation score of 0 is correct; the code is straightforward.\n   - The overall security risk score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n5. **Claims about Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n   - They recognize the code as purely structural and for static type checking.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All reports consistently assign 0 for malware and obfuscation, and 0 for security risk.\n   - The detailed reasoning supports these scores.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. The code is static, with no executable or data handling parts that could be malicious.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is transparent, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- **Risk Score:** 0. The code is purely for type annotations, with no security implications.\n\n**My own assessment aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for a client SDK.\n- No runtime logic, no data flows involving untrusted inputs, no external communications.\n- The use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard practice.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, straightforward, and serves solely as static type definitions for API data structures.",
