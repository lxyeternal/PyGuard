  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - The code consists solely of static type definitions, imports, and conditional imports based on Python version.  \n   - No runtime logic, data processing, network calls, or untrusted input handling are present.  \n   - No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic**  \n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative and for static type checking.  \n   - They note the absence of runtime or data handling that could introduce vulnerabilities.  \n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.  \n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty that the analysis is correct.  \n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   - The code is purely for type annotations and does not process data at runtime.  \n   - No potential vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.  \n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   - The malware scores are all 0, aligning with the analysis that there are no malicious payloads or behaviors.  \n   - The code does not perform any external communication, data exfiltration, or code execution.\n\n6. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**  \n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as static type definitions.  \n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the detailed reasoning.  \n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \n- The code is a straightforward set of type definitions for an SDK, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.  \n- The reports are accurate, thorough, and align with the code's purpose.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious constructs)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, safe, and well-structured set of type annotations for an SDK. It poses no security threat or malware risk.",
