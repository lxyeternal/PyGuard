  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for the workspaces-thin-client service API in Python, mainly used for data validation and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads only static type annotations, constants, and imported type definitions; no input or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or perform potentially harmful actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted inputs; all data structures are statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. It primarily defines types for data validation.",
  "analysis": "This module provides static type definitions using TypedDict and conditional imports for compatibility. It does not include any runtime code, input handling, or external calls. There are no operations that could lead to data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity. The presence of version-dependent imports and type annotations is standard and safe. No suspicious code, network activity, or potential backdoors are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward type definition module intended for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining data structures and has no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, or external communication that could be exploited or malicious. Overall, it is safe from a security perspective.",
