  "purpose": "Type annotations for workspaces-thin-client service type definitions.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions using TypedDict, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, no runtime data handling or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data output.",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares data schemas without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, purely declarative, with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions for an SDK, with conditional imports based on Python version. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, network calls, or untrusted input handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is 0, aligning with the code's static, schema-only nature. The assessments across reports are consistent and justified, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of static type definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and accurate.",
