  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the workspaces-thin-client service API.",
  "sources": "Type definitions importing from external modules, and the use of sys.version_info to conditionally import modules and types.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code solely defines data structures and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. Usage of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard practice for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No runtime logic, user input handling, network operations, or data processing is present. All imported modules and type definitions appear to serve static typing purposes only. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The presence of comments and documentation suggests transparency and no obfuscation or hidden intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type definition module for a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely provides structured type annotations for the service API. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
