  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\nAll five reports describe the code as a static type definition module for a Python SDK, using TypedDict and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. They emphasize that the code only declares data schemas, with no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated code score of 0, and security risk of 0, indicating they see no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code consists solely of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports. There are no runtime behaviors, data flows, or external interactions.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code appears well-structured, standard, and free of suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all 0, consistent with the static, declarative nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  The code is purely type definitions; no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are present. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  No obfuscation or hidden logic exists. The code is straightforward, so a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  Given the absence of runtime code, external calls, or data handling, the overall security risk is negligible, justifying a score of 0.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations. There are no signs of backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed analysis, **the code is a standard, safe set of type definitions with no security concerns**. The scores assigned are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the reports' conclusions, confirming that the code is safe and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a well-structured, purely declarative set of type annotations for an SDK. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The current scoring and analysis are appropriate and justified.",
