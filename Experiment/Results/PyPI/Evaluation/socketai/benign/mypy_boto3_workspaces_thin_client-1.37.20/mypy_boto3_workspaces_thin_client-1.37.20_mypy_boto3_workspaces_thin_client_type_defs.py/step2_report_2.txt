  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is purely static type definitions, with no runtime logic, data processing, or untrusted input handling. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code primarily serves as a schema for type safety and documentation.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is static, declarative, and does not process untrusted data. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident. The code's purpose is clear, and the assessments about its safety are consistent.\n\n3. **Scores given to issues:**  \n   All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code. The obfuscated score is also 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports conclude that the code is purely for static type definitions with no runtime or data handling, raising the risk or malware scores above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or risky.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or hidden code.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All assessments are based on the static, declarative nature of the code. No assumptions about hidden behavior are made; the analysis is consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions for a Python SDK, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities. The purpose is static type annotation, which is inherently safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
