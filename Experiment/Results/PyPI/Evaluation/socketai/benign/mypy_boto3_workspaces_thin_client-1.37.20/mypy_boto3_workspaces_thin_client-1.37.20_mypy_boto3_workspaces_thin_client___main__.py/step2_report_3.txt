  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that displays package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - All reports agree that the code does not process untrusted input beyond argument checking, does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or execute malicious code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is static, benign, and intended solely for informational output.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n   - The reasoning in all reports is sound and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No changes needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations, so a higher score isn't warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as non-malicious and safe.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable ratings are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the script, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is purely informational, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the provided evaluations.**",
