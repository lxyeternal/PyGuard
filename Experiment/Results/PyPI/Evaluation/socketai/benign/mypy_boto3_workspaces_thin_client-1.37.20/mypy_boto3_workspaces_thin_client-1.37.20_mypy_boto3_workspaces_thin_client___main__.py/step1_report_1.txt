  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data. No dynamic code execution or external data fetching observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines functions to print package info and version. It checks for a '--version' argument to decide what to print. No user input beyond command-line args is processed. No data leaks, external calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, primarily for informational display, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a CLI informational utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign script intended for user information output.",
