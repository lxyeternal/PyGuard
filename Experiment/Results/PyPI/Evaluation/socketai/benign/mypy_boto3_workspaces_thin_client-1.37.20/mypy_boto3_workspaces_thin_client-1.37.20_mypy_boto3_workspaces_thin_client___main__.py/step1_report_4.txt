  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint script for printing package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), writes to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs information).",
  "flows": "Checks if '--version' is in sys.argv; if so, calls print_version(), else calls print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No use of unsafe functions or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and informational.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles command-line argument checking and prints package info or version. It does not process untrusted input beyond argument checking, nor does it perform network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. The code appears standard, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI script for informational purposes, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
