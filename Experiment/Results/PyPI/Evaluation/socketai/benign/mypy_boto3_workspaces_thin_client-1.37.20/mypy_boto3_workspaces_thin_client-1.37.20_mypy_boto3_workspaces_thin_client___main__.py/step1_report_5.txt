  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entry point to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; writes output to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Output functions such as sys.stdout.write; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "User input via sys.argv triggers the print_version function, which outputs version info; otherwise, package info is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for '--version' argument to decide whether to print version info or package info. It uses sys.argv for input detection and sys.stdout.write for output. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted input. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The content is limited to informational output related to the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version details. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The script appears legitimate and safe.",
