  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers output to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines functions to print package info and version. It checks for '--version' argument to decide which output to print. No untrusted input processing beyond argument check, no external data sources, no malicious or suspicious code. The content is static documentation and version info. No flow leads to data leaks or harmful actions. The code appears to be straightforward CLI utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI utility for displaying static package information and version. It contains no malicious behavior, no backdoors, and no security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
