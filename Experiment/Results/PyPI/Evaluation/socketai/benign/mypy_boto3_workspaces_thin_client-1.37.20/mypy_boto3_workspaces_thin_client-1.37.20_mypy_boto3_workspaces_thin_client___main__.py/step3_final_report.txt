  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs package information or version based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for argument detection",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output",
  "flows": "Argument check for '--version' leading to print_version() or print_info()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a static CLI script that prints package info or version. It does not process untrusted input beyond argument detection, does not perform network or file operations, and contains no obfuscation or secrets. The code's behavior is benign, with no malicious or security-risk patterns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
