  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, well-structured SDK stub with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The potential security concern is limited to the typical risks associated with untrusted input in SDK methods, which does not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk."
