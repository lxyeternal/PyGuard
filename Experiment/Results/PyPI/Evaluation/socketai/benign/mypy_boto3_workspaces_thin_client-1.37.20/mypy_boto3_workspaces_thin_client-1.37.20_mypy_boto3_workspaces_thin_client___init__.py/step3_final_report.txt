  "purpose": "Module providing interface setup and documentation for the AWS WorkSpaces Thin Client service, exporting relevant classes and clients.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.client and .paginator), no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no processing of untrusted input, network activity, or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static import and export setup only.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future; this is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes, defines an alias, and sets up __all__ for exports. It contains only documentation and setup code with no runtime logic, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The future date is benign and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple interface layer for a client library. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risks are detected. The minor future date is an insignificant anomaly. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
