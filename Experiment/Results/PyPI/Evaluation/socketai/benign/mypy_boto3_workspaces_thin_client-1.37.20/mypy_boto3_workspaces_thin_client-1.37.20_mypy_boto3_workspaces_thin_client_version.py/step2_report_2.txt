  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the code in question.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.20\"\n```\n\nThis is a minimal, standard pattern for defining a package version in Python. It contains a comment, a copyright notice, and a single assignment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is just a static assignment of a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Any errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign, straightforward, and typical for version declaration.\n\n- **Scores assessment:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated as 0, and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n1. **Malware Score:**  \n   The code is static, contains no dynamic or external input, and no suspicious patterns. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**  \n   The code is transparent and straightforward. The obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n\n3. **Risk Score:**  \n   Given the benign nature, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n4. **Potential for assumptions:**  \n   No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is clearly just version metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns.",
