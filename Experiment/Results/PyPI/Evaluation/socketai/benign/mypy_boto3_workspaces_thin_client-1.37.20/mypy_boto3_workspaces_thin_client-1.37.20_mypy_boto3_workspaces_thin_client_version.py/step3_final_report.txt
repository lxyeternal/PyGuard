  "purpose": "Define the package version as a static string for version control.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it contains a comment and a single assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static declaration of a version string with a comment and copyright notice. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code serves a standard purpose in version management and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
