  "targets": "N/A",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets other than version info, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a variable assignment setting __version__ to a static string. The comment indicates it is the source of truth for versioning, which is standard practice. The code does not contain any dynamic execution, input handling, or suspicious behavior. It is a minimal, conventional pattern for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely used for version tracking. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
