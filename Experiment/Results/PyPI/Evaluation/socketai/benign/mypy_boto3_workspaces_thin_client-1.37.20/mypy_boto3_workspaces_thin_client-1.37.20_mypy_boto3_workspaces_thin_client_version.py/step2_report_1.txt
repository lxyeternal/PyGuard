  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input handling, external calls, or dynamic behavior is present.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious logic, or anomalies are identified.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; there are no logical errors or flaws.\n   - The code's purpose is straightforward, and the assessments correctly identify its benign nature.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is static and contains no external input or dynamic execution, there are no grounds to assign any risk scores above zero.\n   - The assumption that a version declaration is harmless is valid here.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - The scoring aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n- Given the simplicity and standard nature of this code, no changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code is benign; it serves its purpose as a version indicator without any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
