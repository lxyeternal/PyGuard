  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code contains a simple docstring comment and a single assignment setting a version string. There are no functions, input/output operations, network activity, or any dynamic behavior. The version string appears hardcoded and static, which is typical for version declarations in Python packages. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
