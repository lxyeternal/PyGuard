  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behavior, or external data handling.\n   - The code is minimal, boilerplate, and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments are unanimous and the code is trivial, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or suspicious features.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code is standard boilerplate for versioning, with no security implications.",
