  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment, copyright notice, and a simple assignment of a version string to __version__. There are no inputs, no external data sources, and no suspicious behaviors. The version number appears static and hardcoded, which is common practice. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks.",
