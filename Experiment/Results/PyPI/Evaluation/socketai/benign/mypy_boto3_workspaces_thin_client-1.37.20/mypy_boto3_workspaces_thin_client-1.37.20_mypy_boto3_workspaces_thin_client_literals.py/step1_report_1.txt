  "purpose": "Define string literal types for use in type annotations related to AWS services and specific application domains.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions assigned to variables, import statements for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data processing, external system calls, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; mainly static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs. The code is purely declarative and type-related.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then declares multiple 'Literal' type aliases for various AWS service names, resource types, and application-specific string constants. All definitions are static, and there are no runtime data manipulations, input/output operations, or external communications. The code appears to be a straightforward set of type annotations meant to facilitate type checking and code clarity. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purely declarative module providing type annotations for string literals used in AWS SDK interactions. It contains no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
