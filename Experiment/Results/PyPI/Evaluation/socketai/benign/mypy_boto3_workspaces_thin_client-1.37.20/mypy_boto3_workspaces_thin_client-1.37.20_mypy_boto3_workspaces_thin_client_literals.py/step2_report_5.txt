  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or misalignments with the code.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a static, declarative module defining string literal types for AWS service names, resource types, and application-specific constants.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, then assigns multiple type aliases.\n- There are no runtime operations, external data handling, or security-sensitive logic.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The purpose is to facilitate static type checking and improve code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; defines literals for AWS and application-specific types.  \n- **Sinks & flows:** No data processing or external interactions.  \n- **Anomalies:** None.  \n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; code is purely declarative with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware and security risk are 0, which is appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; similar to Report 1, focusing on type safety.  \n- **Sinks & flows:** No untrusted data or external outputs.  \n- **Anomalies:** None.  \n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Valid; static type annotations only.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware and security risk are 0, which aligns with the code's nature.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & sources:** Same as above; defines literals for AWS services.  \n- **Sinks & flows:** No data flow or external input handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** None.  \n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; purely static type definitions.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & sources:** Similar to previous; extensive list of AWS resource and service names.  \n- **Sinks & flows:** No external data or runtime logic.  \n- **Anomalies:** None.  \n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Valid; static string literal type aliases.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; defines literals for AWS and related identifiers.  \n- **Sinks & flows:** No external data handling or runtime logic.  \n- **Anomalies:** None.  \n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Valid; static type hints only.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions.\n- No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and reasonable.\n- The code's purpose is purely for static type checking, with no runtime or security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks present)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard type annotation module with no security concerns. The reports are consistent with the code's nature and accurately reflect its benign intent.",
