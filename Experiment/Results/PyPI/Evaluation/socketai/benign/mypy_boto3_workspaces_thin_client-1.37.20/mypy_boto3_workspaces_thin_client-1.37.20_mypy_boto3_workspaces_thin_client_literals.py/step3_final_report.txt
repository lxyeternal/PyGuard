  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS service names, resource types, and application-specific constants using Literal types for enhanced type safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals assigned to type aliases, imported conditionally based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains no runtime data input, output, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "None; purely static definitions with no data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of static type alias definitions using Literal for various AWS services and application constants. It conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, which is standard. No runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. The purpose is to improve type safety and documentation within a larger codebase. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and solely for type annotation purposes. All assessments indicating malware, obfuscation, or security risks are justified as zero. No issues or security concerns are present.",
