{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS SDK service and resource names related to the workspaces-thin-client service and other AWS services.",
  "sources": "Type alias assignments for various literal types, primarily static string lists, and conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external input handling present; no code that could act as a sink for malicious data.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code consists solely of static type definitions with no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected. The code mainly declares string literal types for static typing.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple type alias variables with string literal types. It includes extensive lists of AWS resource, service, and region names, and is entirely static with no runtime logic or data processing. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious activity are present. The code appears to be a standard type definition module for static type checking in a larger SDK context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of static type definitions for AWS SDK literals, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a type hinting aid and contains no runtime vulnerabilities.",
