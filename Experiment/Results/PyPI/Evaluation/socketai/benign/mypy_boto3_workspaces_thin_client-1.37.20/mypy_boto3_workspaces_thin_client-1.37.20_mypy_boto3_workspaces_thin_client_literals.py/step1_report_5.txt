  "purpose": "Define type annotations for string literals used in the workspaces-thin-client service and related AWS resource identifiers.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions assigned directly to variables; imports of sys and typing modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, external data processing, or network interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code consists solely of static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is purely type definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, then declares multiple string literal types for use as type annotations in other parts of the codebase. The variables are simple type aliases, with no dynamic code, input handling, or system manipulation. No embedded network calls, file access, or credential management detected. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard type hint definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign set of type alias definitions intended for static typing support. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code serves as documentation and type hinting, with no operational or security implications.",
