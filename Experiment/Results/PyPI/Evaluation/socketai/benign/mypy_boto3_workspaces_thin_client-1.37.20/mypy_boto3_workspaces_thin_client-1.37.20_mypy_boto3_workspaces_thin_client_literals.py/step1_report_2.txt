{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for literals used in the workspaces-thin-client service and other AWS service identifiers for type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions; assignments of Literal types; constant string literals defining allowed values for various types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; all literals are predefined constants used for type annotations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; this is purely type annotation code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; all code consists of standard type annotations and string literal definitions. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for string literals, conditioned on Python version. It imports from sys and typing_extensions only to define Literal types for various categories relevant to AWS SDKs. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or sensitive operations are present. The purpose is to provide static type hints for better code correctness. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended solely for static type safety. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard, well-structured set of literal type definitions for AWS SDK client usage.",
