{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literals used in the workspaces-thin-client service for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions assigned to variables, import statements for typing, and conditional import based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; the code only defines type annotations and imports.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code is static type definitions and does not involve runtime data flow or external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports necessary typing constructs, conditionally based on Python version, and defines multiple Literal types for consistent type annotations throughout the package. All definitions are straightforward string literal types with no dynamic execution or external data handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type annotation setup for a Python package, containing only static Literal definitions and version-dependent imports. There are no indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in this code.",
