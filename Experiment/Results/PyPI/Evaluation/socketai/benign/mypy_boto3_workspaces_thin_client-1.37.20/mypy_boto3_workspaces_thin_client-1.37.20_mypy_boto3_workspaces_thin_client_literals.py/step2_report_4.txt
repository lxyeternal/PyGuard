  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report to ensure consistency, correctness, and alignment with security considerations.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as static type annotations defining string literals for AWS service names, resource types, and application-specific constants.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- The code is conditioned on Python version to import `Literal` appropriately.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: improve type safety, code clarity, and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is purely declarative with no runtime or security-sensitive operations.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n\n- **Logical or structural errors:** None. The code correctly handles conditional imports based on Python version, and all type alias definitions are straightforward.\n\n### Scores Given in Reports:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** All assign 0, justified as the code is static and non-operational.\n\n**Suggestion:** No score adjustments needed; all assessments are reasonable.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n\n- **Risk score = 0:** The code contains no runtime logic, no external data handling, and no security-sensitive operations. Therefore, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n\n### Challenges to Claims Based on Assumptions:\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent:** None. The code is a static set of type aliases, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n### Consistency of Scores with the Reports:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — No malicious behavior or payloads detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, declarative type alias definitions with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** **0** — No operational code, external interactions, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of static type annotations for AWS SDK string literals. It is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n**No changes or corrections are necessary.**",
