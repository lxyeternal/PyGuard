  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS service names, resource types, and application-specific constants.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, then assigns multiple type aliases.\n- There are no runtime operations, data processing, external calls, or input handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The purpose is to facilitate static type checking and improve code clarity.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for AWS and application literals.\n- **Findings:** Static definitions, no data flow, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, purely declarative.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar static type annotations for AWS identifiers.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, no external interactions, purely static.\n- **Assessment:** Standard type alias definitions, no malicious intent.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Define literals for type safety, with conditional import.\n- **Findings:** Static, no runtime data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Typical type definition module, safe and benign.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Type literals for AWS SDK resource and service names.\n- **Findings:** Static, no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Standard static type definitions, no security issues.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Similar static type alias definitions.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no external data, purely static.\n- **Assessment:** Benign, typical type hinting code.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nAll reports consistently describe code that is purely declarative, static type alias definitions for string literals related to AWS services and application domains. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for static type checking, with no operational or security concerns.\n\n**Final note:** I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign and purely for type safety, with no malicious or security implications.",
