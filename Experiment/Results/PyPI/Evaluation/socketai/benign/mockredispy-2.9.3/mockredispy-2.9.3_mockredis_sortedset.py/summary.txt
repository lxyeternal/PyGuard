  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a sorted set data structure. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The slight security risk scores (~0.1) are conservative and unnecessary given the benign nature; they should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
