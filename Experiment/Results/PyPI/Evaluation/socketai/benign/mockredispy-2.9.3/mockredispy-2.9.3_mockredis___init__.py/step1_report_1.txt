  "purpose": "Expose and re-export specific classes and functions from the mockredis.client module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from mockredis.client import ...'",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; simple import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports three items from a module named mockredis.client and exposes them via __all__. There is no data processing, network communication, or any dynamic code execution. The use of mock classes suggests this is intended for testing purposes, not production malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The module appears to be a straightforward re-export.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that re-exports mock Redis client classes/functions for testing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
