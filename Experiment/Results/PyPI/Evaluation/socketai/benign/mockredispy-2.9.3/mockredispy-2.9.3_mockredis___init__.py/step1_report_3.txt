  "purpose": "Expose and re-export specific classes and functions from the mockredis.client module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'mockredis.client' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the code only performs imports and exports.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes/functions from a module and makes them available publicly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three items from a module named 'mockredis.client' and defines the __all__ list for export. There is no user input, no data processing, no network activity, and no use of environment variables. The code appears to be intended for testing or mocking Redis interactions. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security issues are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module re-export without any malicious intent or security concerns. It serves to expose specific mock Redis classes/functions for use elsewhere. No risks or malware are detected.",
