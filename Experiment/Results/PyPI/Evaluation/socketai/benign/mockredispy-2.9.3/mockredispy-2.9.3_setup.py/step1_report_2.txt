{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'mockredispy' Python package, used to package and distribute the module with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Constants (__version__, __build__, setup parameters), package discovery via find_packages(), dependencies in setup_requires, extras_require, and tests_require.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no code executing untrusted input or external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A – the script primarily defines package metadata and dependencies without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The placeholder __build__ is meant to be replaced by Jenkins, which is standard CI practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and testing configurations without executing any external or untrusted code. The versioning scheme includes a build placeholder for CI automation, which is typical. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or anomalous patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily serves to package and distribute code, with standard dependencies and metadata.",
