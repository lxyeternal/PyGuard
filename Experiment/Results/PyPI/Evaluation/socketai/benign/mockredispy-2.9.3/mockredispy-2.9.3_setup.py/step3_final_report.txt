  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the Python package 'mockredispy', defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Package metadata variables (__version__, __build__), dependencies in setup() (setup_requires, extras_require, tests_require), and entry_points for nose plugin.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "The code assigns version info and dependencies; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder __build__ for CI/CD build replacement; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious patterns. The placeholder __build__ is a common CI/CD pattern. No external input, network activity, or obfuscation detected. All signals indicate benign intent. The code's structure and dependencies are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
