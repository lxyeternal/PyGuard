{
  "purpose": "Configure the setup for the 'mockredispy' Python package, including versioning, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads version info (__version__ and __build__), package dependencies (setup_requires, extras_require, tests_require), and package metadata (name, description, url, license).",
  "sinks": "The setup configuration passes data to setuptools functions, which are used for package installation and metadata registration; no direct data sinks involving untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "The version variables (__version__, __build__) are concatenated and passed to setup(); dependencies are specified for installation; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected; code strictly configures package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package, importing only setuptools, defining version variables, and calling setup() with package metadata and dependencies. It does not contain any code execution, data input/output handling, or suspicious constructs. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
