  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code and the reasoning behind the scores, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code matches the provided script exactly.\n- **Logic & Behavior:** No suspicious or malicious code; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n  These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Presence:** Matches the script.\n- **Logic & Behavior:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns; placeholder __build__ is standard CI/CD practice.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n  Correctly reflects the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable and well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Presence:** Matches the script.\n- **Logic & Behavior:** No suspicious behavior; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's evaluation is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Presence:** Matches the script.\n- **Logic & Behavior:** No anomalies; placeholder __build__ is normal build-time variable.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n  Justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Presence:** Matches the script.\n- **Logic & Behavior:** No suspicious or malicious activity; placeholder is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n  Correct.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior—no code injection, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, reflecting that this is a benign setup script with no security issues.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, the code is a standard, benign Python package setup script. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is typical for Python packaging, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The placeholder for build metadata is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The scores are reasonable and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
