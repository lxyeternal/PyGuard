  "purpose": "Setup script for the mockredispy Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, version strings, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted input flows to critical functions or data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholders (__build__) that are intended to be replaced during build process; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It defines versioning, dependencies, and entry points without any dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity. The placeholder __build__ is a common pattern for build metadata and is replaced during deployment, not executed as code. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code are present. The dependencies are typical for testing and optional features, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs package setup tasks without any suspicious or malicious code. The placeholder for build metadata is benign and expected in package development.",
