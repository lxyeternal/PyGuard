  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'mockredispy' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements, string assignments (__version__, __build__), setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being processed from untrusted sources or written to untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script is standard package setup code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder variable __build__ intended for build replacement; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities from setuptools, defines versioning info with placeholders, and configures package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of data input, malicious code, or obfuscation. The use of __build__ indicates build-time modification, which is normal in CI/CD pipelines. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
