      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a sorted set data structure. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The slight security risk scores (~0.1) are conservative and unnecessary given the benign nature; they should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing utility for switching between real and mock Redis instances. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected. The minor dynamic behavior based on user input does not pose a security threat. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0."

The scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk should be set to 0, reflecting its safe and testing-only nature."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured mock Redis client intended for testing. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The slight security risk score accounts for the presence of scripting functions, which are controlled and limited within the mock environment. Overall, the scores and assessments across the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's purpose."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Lua scripting interface for Redis with no inherent malicious intent. The primary security concern is environmental: dynamic shared library loading and dependency management could be exploited if the environment is compromised. The code itself is not malicious, but proper environment validation and secure dependency handling are recommended to mitigate potential risks."
