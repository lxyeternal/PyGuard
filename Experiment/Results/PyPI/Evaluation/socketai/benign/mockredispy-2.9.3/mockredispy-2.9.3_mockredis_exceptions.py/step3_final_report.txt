  "purpose": "Provides fallback exception classes for redis.exceptions if the redis library is not installed, ensuring compatibility.",
  "sources": "Attempts to import exceptions from redis.exceptions; fallback class definitions if import fails.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; purely class definitions with no data flow.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from redis.exceptions; fallback class definitions; no data flow or execution beyond class creation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import with fallback classes, standard pattern for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific exceptions from redis.exceptions. If the import fails, it defines fallback classes inheriting from Exception or RedisError. This pattern ensures compatibility without executing malicious code or handling untrusted data. The fallback classes are simple, with no logic or side effects. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or command execution. The purpose is purely to maintain interface consistency in environments lacking the redis library. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, compatibility-focused nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard fallback pattern for Redis exception classes, with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior. The reports correctly identify its purpose and security posture. The assigned scores are appropriate; the code poses no security threat.",
