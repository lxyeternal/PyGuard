{
  "purpose": "The code provides emulated exceptions for Redis client errors to ensure compatibility when the redis library is not available.",
  "sources": "The import statement from redis.exceptions and the fallback class definitions within the except block.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle or process untrusted data, nor does it execute external commands or store data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no source-to-sink data flows in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, providing fallback exception classes if redis.exceptions cannot be imported.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific exceptions from the redis library. If the import fails (e.g., redis library not installed), it defines placeholder exception classes with the same names. These classes inherit from Exception or RedisError, maintaining interface consistency. There is no indication of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The structure is standard for providing fallback exceptions. The code does not process or handle untrusted input or data. It’s a simple compatibility layer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility that emulates Redis client exceptions when the redis library is unavailable. It contains no malicious or security-sensitive behavior.",
