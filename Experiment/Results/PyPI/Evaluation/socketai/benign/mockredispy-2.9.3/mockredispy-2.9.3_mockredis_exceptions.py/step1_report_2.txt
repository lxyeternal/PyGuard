  "purpose": "To emulate Redis client exceptions for compatibility or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement attempting to import exception classes from redis.exceptions",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output occurs",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink, only exception class definitions",
  "anomalies": "The code defines fallback exception classes if the redis.exceptions module cannot be imported, which is a benign compatibility pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import specific exception classes from the 'redis.exceptions' module. If the import fails (ImportError), it defines simple custom exception classes that inherit from Exception or RedisError, mimicking the expected exceptions. This pattern ensures that code depending on these exceptions can function whether or not the 'redis' library is installed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward, focusing solely on exception class definitions and import handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility to emulate Redis exceptions if the 'redis' library is not present. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
