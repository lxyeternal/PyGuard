  "purpose": "Defines exception classes to emulate Redis client exceptions if the 'redis' library is not available.",
  "sources": "Imports exceptions from 'redis.exceptions' or defines fallback classes if import fails.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific exception classes from the 'redis' library to mimic Redis client errors. If the import fails (e.g., 'redis' not installed), it defines fallback custom exception classes. This approach allows for flexible handling of Redis-related exceptions without exposing any malicious behavior. The fallback classes are simple subclasses of Exception with no additional logic, indicating straightforward error emulation. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks; the code is standard for creating compatibility layers.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a safe fallback mechanism for Redis exceptions, ensuring compatibility if the 'redis' library is missing. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks present.",
