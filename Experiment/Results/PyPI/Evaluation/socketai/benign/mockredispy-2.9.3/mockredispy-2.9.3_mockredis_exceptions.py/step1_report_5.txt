  "purpose": "Defines exception classes to emulate Redis client exceptions if the redis library is not installed, allowing code compatibility.",
  "sources": "The import statement from redis.exceptions and fallback class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output actions observed.",
  "flows": "The import flow from redis.exceptions to the exception handling logic; fallback class definitions if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to simply emulate exceptions; no suspicious or malicious activity such as data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import Redis-specific exception classes. If unavailable, it defines dummy classes with the same names inheriting from Exception or RedisError. This is a standard fallback pattern to ensure compatibility across environments. No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility layer for Redis exceptions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
