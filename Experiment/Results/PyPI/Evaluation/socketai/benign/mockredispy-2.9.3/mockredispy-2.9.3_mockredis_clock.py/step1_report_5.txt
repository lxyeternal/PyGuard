  "purpose": "Define an abstract clock interface and a system clock implementation to retrieve current time.",
  "sources": "Importing datetime module, calling datetime.now() in SystemClock.now() method.",
  "sinks": "SystemClock.now() returns current system time; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "flows": "No external input sources; the flow is straightforward from method call to return current time.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class Clock with an abstract method now(), and a concrete subclass SystemClock that implements now() by returning the current system time via datetime.now(). The use of ABCMeta and abstractmethod indicates an intention for subclassing and testing, not malicious activity. No external data or network interaction occurs. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard clock abstraction for testability and does not contain any malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
