{
  "purpose": "Provide an abstraction for obtaining the current system time, allowing for subclassing in testing scenarios.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code uses system functions such as datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "The now() method in SystemClock calls datetime.now() to get the current time.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and follows standard patterns for clock abstraction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract Clock class with an abstract method now(), and a concrete implementation SystemClock that returns the current system time. There are no external data inputs, no suspicious dynamic code, or malicious constructs. The code is a simple, common pattern for dependency injection in testing environments. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, well-structured clock abstraction used for providing current time. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
