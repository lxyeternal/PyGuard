{
  "purpose": "Provide a clock abstraction for dependency injection and testing scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via datetime.now() in the SystemClock.now() method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: the SystemClock.now() method retrieves system time without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated Python 2 style __metaclass__ syntax; no malicious or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract Clock class with an abstract method now(). SystemClock implements now() by returning datetime.now(). The use of ABCMeta in Python 2 style is outdated but not malicious. No external data, network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is simple, intended for dependency injection/testing, and safe. All signals indicate benign behavior with no security risks or malware. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward clock abstraction with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
