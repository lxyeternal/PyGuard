{
  "purpose": "Provide an abstraction for getting the current system time, allowing for subclassing in testing scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via datetime.now() in SystemClock.now().",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; no data leakage points.",
  "flows": "The source is datetime.now(), which provides current system time; no data flows into external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; code is simple and straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract Clock class with an abstract method now(). The SystemClock subclass implements now() using datetime.now(), a standard way to retrieve system time. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be designed for testability by allowing subclassing. There is no malicious or security risk behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing a clock abstraction without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward, well-structured implementation for providing current time, suitable for testing or production use.",
