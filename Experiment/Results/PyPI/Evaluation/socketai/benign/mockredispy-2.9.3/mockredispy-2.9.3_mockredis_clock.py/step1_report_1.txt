  "purpose": "Defines an abstract clock interface and a system clock implementation to retrieve current datetime.",
  "sources": "No input sources; only class methods and attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems; methods return datetime objects.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; simple method call returning system time.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated __metaclass__ syntax in Python 2 style, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class 'Clock' with an abstract method 'now'. The 'SystemClock' class implements 'now' by returning 'datetime.now()'. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network connections, and no suspicious code patterns. The code is a straightforward implementation of a clock abstraction for testing or real-time purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign abstraction of a clock interface with a standard implementation. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
