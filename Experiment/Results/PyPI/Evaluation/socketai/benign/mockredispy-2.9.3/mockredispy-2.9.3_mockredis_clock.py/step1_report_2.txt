{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract clock interface and a concrete implementation that returns the current system time.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current system time via datetime.now() in SystemClock.now().",
  "sinks": "The current system time is returned; no data is sent elsewhere or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Source (datetime.now()) -> return value of SystemClock.now()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class Clock with an abstract method now(). The subclass SystemClock implements now() by returning datetime.now(), a standard and safe way to get current time. No input from external sources, no data leakage, or insecure practices are present. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The structure is simple, intended for testing or real-time use. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe abstraction for clock functionality with no malicious intent. It can be used securely for time-based operations or testing scenarios.",
