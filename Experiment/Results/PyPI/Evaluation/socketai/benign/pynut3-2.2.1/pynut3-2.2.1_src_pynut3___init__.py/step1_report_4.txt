  "purpose": "Defines and exports classes for a Python client library, likely for interacting with a NUT (Network UPS Tools) server.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules '.nut3' for PyNUT3Error and PyNUT3Client.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network connections, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple import statements from internal modules and an explicit __all__ list. There are no inputs, data processing, or outputs. The module appears to be part of a larger package, acting as an interface or API layer. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code's simplicity reduces the likelihood of hidden malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that exposes classes from internal modules for external use. There are no indications of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation within this snippet.",
