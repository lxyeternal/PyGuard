  "purpose": "Define and export classes for Nut3 client and error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local module files (.nut3).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from input to output or between functions.",
  "anomalies": "Simple import and export statements; no unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a local module named '.nut3', specifically 'PyNUT3Error' and 'PyNUT3Client', and explicitly declares these in the __all__ list for module exports. The code consists solely of import statements and a declaration of exported symbols with no dynamic execution, data processing, or network operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or other anomalies. It appears to be standard module setup code for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import/export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and typical for package modules.",
