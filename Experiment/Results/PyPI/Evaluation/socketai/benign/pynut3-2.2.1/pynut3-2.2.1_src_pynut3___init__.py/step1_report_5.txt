{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports classes 'PyNUT3Error' and 'PyNUT3Client' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local module files '.nut3' for 'PyNUT3Error' and 'PyNUT3Client'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external connections.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "Simple import and export declarations; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules and defines an export list. There are no data processing, network calls, or runtime behaviors indicating malicious activity. The structure is typical for a Python module that provides specific classes for external use.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It only imports and exports classes, with no evident malicious or suspicious behavior.",
