  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'PartType' as a union of str and int for type hinting.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; only static type alias definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink, as the code only defines a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Union' from the 'typing' module and creates a type alias 'PartType' that can be either a string or an integer. There are no functions, data manipulations, or external interactions. The code appears purely declarative and standard for type hinting.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign type alias definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
