{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'PartType' as either 'str' or 'int' for type hinting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Union' from the 'typing' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code is static and declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code simply assigns a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward type alias declaration with no functions, data processing, or dynamic behavior. It imports 'Union' and defines 'PartType' as a union of 'str' and 'int'. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard type alias with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
