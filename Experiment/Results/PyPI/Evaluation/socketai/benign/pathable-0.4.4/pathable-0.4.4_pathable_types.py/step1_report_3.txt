  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'PartType' as a union of string and integer types for type hinting purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'Union' from the 'typing' module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is purely type aliasing without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward type aliasing with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Union' from the 'typing' module and defines 'PartType' as a union of 'str' and 'int'. It is a simple, standard type hinting construct with no dynamic execution, user input handling, or data processing. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard type alias definition with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
