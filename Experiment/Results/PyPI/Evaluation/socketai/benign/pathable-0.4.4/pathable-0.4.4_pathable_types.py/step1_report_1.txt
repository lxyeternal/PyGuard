  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'PartType' as a union of str and int for type hinting.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks due to lack of input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type alias definition using Python's typing.Union. It imports the 'Union' type and creates 'PartType' as an alias for either str or int. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. The code appears benign and standard for type hinting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless type alias definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
