  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'PartType' as a union of string and integer types.",
  "sources": "The 'typing' module is imported to enable type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations present.",
  "flows": "The code only defines a type alias without any data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing 'Union' from 'typing' and defining a type alias 'PartType' as a union of 'str' and 'int'. There are no input sources, data flows, or sink functions. The code serves as a type hinting utility and contains no executable logic or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple type alias definition with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and standard for type annotations.",
