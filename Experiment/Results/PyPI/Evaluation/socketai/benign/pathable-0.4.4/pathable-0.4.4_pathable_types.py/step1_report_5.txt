  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'PartType' as a union of str and int for type hinting purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, especially untrusted data sinks, are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths in this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type alias declaration using Python's typing.Union. It imports the Union type and creates an alias PartType for either string or integer. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a simple type alias for use in larger codebases, and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
