  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing path components and arguments, handling various data types and splitting strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'parts' and 'args', including attributes 'parts' from objects, and string or bytes data.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally without external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through type checks, string splitting, and list appending, with no external or unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with clear logic and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions: 'parse_parts' processes a list of path parts, filtering and splitting based on separator, handling different data types; 'parse_args' constructs parts list from various argument types, raising errors on unexpected types. No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code is simple, safe, and performs standard path parsing tasks without malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for path parsing with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is well-structured, clear, and free of obfuscation or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, reflecting its safety and utility nature.",
