{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'translators' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads package version from '__init__.py', reads long description from 'README.md'. No user input or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools to define package metadata, no data sinks indicating malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file, then uses that data to configure package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is standard package setup script without suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors. The only dynamic reading is version info and description content.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration script for a Python package, importing standard modules, reading description and version data from files, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No suspicious code, obfuscated sections, or malicious behavior are present. No data injection, network activity, or malicious code execution is evident. The dependencies listed are standard packages for package building and runtime operation. No anomalies or signs of sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It follows standard packaging practices without suspicious or malicious code.",
