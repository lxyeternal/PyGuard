{
  "purpose": "This script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'translators' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for CLI usage.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading __init__.py for version, user-provided setup parameters",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data outputs or external calls are evident in this script",
  "flows": "N/A; the script only reads local files and sets up package metadata",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to follow standard packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for packaging a Python project. It reads version information from a local __init__.py file and long description from README.md. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution is involved. Dependencies are explicitly declared. The presence of console script entry points and comprehensive metadata further indicate normal package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and typical for open-source project distribution.",
