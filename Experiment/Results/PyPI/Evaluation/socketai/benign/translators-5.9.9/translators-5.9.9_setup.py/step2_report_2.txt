  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- They note the script reads local files (README.md, __init__.py) for version and description.\n- No untrusted data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns are detected.\n- Dependencies are standard, and the code adheres to common packaging practices.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a typical setup.py script, and the logic aligns with standard practices.\n- **Presence of malicious behavior:** None detected; no network activity, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated segments.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any suspicious activity, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- Since no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is observed, the scores of 0 are reasonable.\n- The reports' reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Potential points of concern:\n- The only dynamic content is reading version info and description from local files, which is standard.\n- No assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on all the reports and the code review, I concur that:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.**",
