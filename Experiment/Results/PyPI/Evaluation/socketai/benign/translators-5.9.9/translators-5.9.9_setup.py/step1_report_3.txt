  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'translators', including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, reading version info from __init__.py, and package setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Read version info -> populate setup parameters -> execute setuptools.setup() with configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. The code strictly adheres to standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads package metadata and version info from local files, and configures the package setup with details including dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. The dependencies listed are standard and well-known packages. No user input, network communication, or code execution from untrusted sources is visible. The code performs typical setup tasks without obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward, with no anomalies indicating malware or malicious intent.",
