  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging the 'translators' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads local files: README.md for long description, __init__.py for version info.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data outputs or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and passes data to setuptools for package configuration; no dynamic or malicious flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script, performing static file reads and package configuration without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. It adheres to standard packaging practices, with dependencies and metadata explicitly specified. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All dependencies are common, and the code structure is clear and well-formed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The provided reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's content.",
