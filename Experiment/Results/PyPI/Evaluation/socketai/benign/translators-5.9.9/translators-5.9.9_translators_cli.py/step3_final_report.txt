  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for translation functions that reads input from user or file, detects HTML content, and calls external translation functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command line argument or file; detects HTML via regex; calls imported translate_text or translate_html functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs translated text to console; no direct sinks for untrusted data within this code.",
  "flows": "Input source (CLI/file) -> HTML detection -> translation function -> output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code; regex for HTML detection is simplistic but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI interface that handles input, detects HTML, and calls external translation functions. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The security and malware risk depend on the imported functions, which are not included. The code's structure is clear, with proper exception handling. The regex for HTML detection is basic but functional. No suspicious network activity or code injection points are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the trustworthiness of the external translation functions. Based on this code alone, there is no evidence of malware or security issues.",
