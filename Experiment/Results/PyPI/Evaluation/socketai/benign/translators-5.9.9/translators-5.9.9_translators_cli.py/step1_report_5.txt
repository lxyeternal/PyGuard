  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for translating text or files using various translation services.",
  "sources": "Input text from command line argument or file, environment variables (via platform.python_version()), and user-provided arguments.",
  "sinks": "Outputs translation results to stdout; potential for injection if translation functions are insecure (though not directly malicious here).",
  "flows": "Input text (from argument or file) -> detection of HTML or plain text -> calling translate_html or translate_text -> printing translation output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or backdoors detected. Use of __version__ import suggests dependency on external module. The code handles user input safely; no dynamic execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around translation functions, handling user inputs securely and with standard error handling. It reads input from a file or direct string, detects if the input is HTML, and calls appropriate translation functions. No evident malicious behavior, no suspicious network activity, no code injection points. The only external dependency is the translate_text and translate_html functions imported from the current package, whose security depends on their implementation. There are no hidden or malicious code snippets or backdoors.\n\nGiven the absence of malicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity, the code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for translation.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate translation CLI interface with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles user input and output appropriately, with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.",
