  "purpose": "CLI tool for translating text or files using various translation services",
  "sources": "User input via command-line argument, file reading from filesystem",
  "sinks": "Translation function output, printing to stdout",
  "flows": "User input -> file read or direct input -> translation function -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles command-line argument parsing, file reading, and calling external translation functions. It reads input from the user or a file, detects if the input is HTML, and directs it to the appropriate translation function. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated parts, or suspicious data handling. The translation functions are imported modules, not included here, but their use appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident. The code relies on external modules which could potentially be malicious if they are malicious, but within this code snippet, no malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for translation tasks with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
