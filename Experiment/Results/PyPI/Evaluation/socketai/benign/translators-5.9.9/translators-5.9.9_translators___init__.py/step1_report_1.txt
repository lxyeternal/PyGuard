{
  "purpose": "Defines metadata and imports functions from the 'translators.server' module for translation-related operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'translators.server', likely reading code from a local module or package within the project.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling, no external network calls, no sensitive data processing visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No obfuscated or unnecessary dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version and author metadata, imports specific functions from 'translators.server', and exposes them via __all__. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing shown. No malicious or malicious-looking behaviors are apparent. The imports suggest usage of translation functionalities, but the code itself is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup for a translation package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports functions from an internal module.",
