{
  "purpose": "Define metadata and re-export functions from the 'translators.server' module for translation-related operations.",
  "sources": "Imported functions from 'translators.server' module, including translate_text, translate_html, and others.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow points include calling the imported functions which may process or transmit data, but no direct untrusted data sink is evident within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (likely external data to the imported functions) through the exported functions, but the code itself does not implement input handling or output; it only re-exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The module only declares metadata and imports/exports functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module metadata (__version__, __author__) and re-exports several functions imported from 'translators.server'. There is no processing, no execution of dynamic code, no data handling or network communication within this snippet. It appears to be a standard module interface definition with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The imported functions might perform translation or network tasks, but these are not present here, and the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that defines metadata and re-exports functions for translation operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet. It is a benign component of a larger translation library.",
