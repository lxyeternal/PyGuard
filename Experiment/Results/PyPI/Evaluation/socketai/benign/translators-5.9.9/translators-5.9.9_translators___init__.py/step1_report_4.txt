{
  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and re-exports specific functions from the 'translators.server' module for translation-related operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'translators.server', including functions and variables related to translation services.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exposes functions and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets module version and author information, then imports several functions and variables from an external 'translators.server' module, and exposes them through __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded credentials, nor suspicious network or file operations. The code appears to be a straightforward module interface setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple module wrapper exposing translation functions and metadata. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
