{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define metadata and exports for a translation library or module, providing functions related to translation, language retrieval, server region, and speed testing.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the 'translators.server' module, which may load external or internal functionalities related to translation services.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data are present in this snippet; the code mainly sets up imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input are evident; the functions imported may handle external data internally but are not invoked here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The module only defines metadata and re-exports functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version and author metadata, imports specific functions from 'translators.server', and declares an __all__ list for exports. There are no dynamic executions, data processing, or external input handling visible. The structure is straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py or setup script, with no suspicious or malicious code evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, the code is benign, primarily setting up module metadata and exports without any suspicious behavior or security risks.",
