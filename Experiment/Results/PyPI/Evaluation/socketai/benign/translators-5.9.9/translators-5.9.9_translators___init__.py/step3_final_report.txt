{
  "purpose": "This module defines package metadata and re-exports functions from an internal translation server module, serving as an interface or __init__.py setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'translators.server' module, reading function definitions and internal code structure.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed; no network or file operations within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports from 'translators.server' as sources; no data flows to sinks or external systems; purely static import and export.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple setup module that declares metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports functions from an internal module, then exposes them via __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. The code's structure is typical for a package's __init__.py file. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk scores. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The imported functions could perform internal network operations, but this cannot be inferred from this snippet alone. Overall, the code appears safe and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module setup with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics. No further concerns are warranted.",
