{
  "purpose": "This module provides a class to interact with Google Spreadsheets via API, allowing metadata retrieval, worksheet management, permissions handling, and export functionalities.",
  "sources": "Fetching sheet metadata, reading properties such as id, title, creationTime, lastUpdateTime, timezone, locale; user input for worksheet indices, titles, sheet IDs, permissions, and updates.",
  "sinks": "API request methods (batch_update, request, export, permission management), file metadata updates, permission changes, sharing, ownership transfer, and exporting functions.",
  "flows": "Sources (metadata fetch, user input) flow into API request methods (e.g., batch_update, request), which can modify spreadsheet properties, permissions, or export data; permission-related data flow from user input into API calls to manage sharing and ownership.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, code injection, or unusual dynamic execution detected; permission transfer and ownership functions perform sensitive operations but are standard API procedures; no hidden backdoors or suspicious network connections evident.",
  "analysis": "The class methods primarily interact with an external API to manage spreadsheet data and permissions, utilizing standard API request patterns. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or stealth operations. All functions are documented and perform expected operations for spreadsheet management. The code reads metadata and user inputs, and writes changes via API calls, which are typical and necessary for its purpose. No suspicious hardcoded data, obfuscated patterns, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper for Google Sheets with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It handles metadata, worksheet management, permissions, and export functions securely and as expected. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.",
