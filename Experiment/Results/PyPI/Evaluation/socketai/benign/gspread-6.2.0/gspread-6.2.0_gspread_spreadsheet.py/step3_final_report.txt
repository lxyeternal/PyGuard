  "purpose": "API wrapper for Google Spreadsheets, managing metadata, sheets, permissions, export, and sharing functionalities.",
  "sources": "fetch_sheet_metadata, batch_update, permissions management, export functions, user inputs for IDs, titles, permissions.",
  "sinks": "API request bodies, permission and ownership transfer endpoints, sharing functions, export endpoints.",
  "flows": "User inputs and metadata fetches into API request payloads; permission and ownership functions modify permissions based on external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client for Google Sheets, performing legitimate operations such as metadata retrieval, sheet management, sharing, permission handling, and exporting. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The data flows are typical for such an API wrapper, with user inputs influencing request bodies. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The permission management functions could be misused if inputs are untrusted, but this is expected for legitimate API features. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscation as 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), considering the potential for permission misuse but within normal API scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper for Google Spreadsheets with no malicious activity or sabotage signals. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the overall supply chain security risk is minimal.",
