  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual behavior, data flows, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- Purpose: API wrapper for Google Spreadsheets, with functions for reading, updating, sharing, exporting.\n- Data flow: From API responses and user inputs into API request bodies.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, low security risk, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code primarily interacts with the Google Sheets API, with no signs of malicious activity. Permission and ownership transfer functions are standard features, not suspicious. The low malware and obfuscated scores (0) are appropriate.  \n**Score adjustments:** None needed.  \n**Confidence:** 0.9 — aligns with code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, managing Google Sheets via API.\n- Data flow: User inputs into API request methods.\n- Anomalies: No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is a straightforward API client, with no malicious indicators. The focus on standard API interactions and permission management is typical.  \n**Score adjustments:** None needed.  \n**Confidence:** 0.9 — consistent with code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Managing Google Sheets, including metadata, sharing, permissions.\n- Data flow: From user inputs and metadata fetches into API calls.\n- Anomalies: No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, low risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is accurate; no malicious behavior or sabotage evident. Permission and ownership methods are standard API features.  \n**Score adjustments:** None needed.  \n**Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Similar management functions, with focus on metadata, sharing, permissions.\n- Data flow: User inputs into API request payloads.\n- Anomalies: No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code's functions are typical for a spreadsheet API wrapper. No signs of malicious activity.  \n**Score adjustments:** None needed.  \n**Confidence:** 0.9 — matches code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Managing spreadsheets, permissions, metadata, exporting.\n- Data flow: User inputs and metadata into API requests.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, no security risks.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe functions for sharing, ownership transfer, and metadata updates are standard API features. No malicious intent or sabotage detected.  \n**Score adjustments:** None needed.  \n**Confidence:** 0.9 — consistent with code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions—no data exfiltration, no code injection, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Low, around 0.2, which aligns with the code's nature as an API wrapper with permission management features.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured API client for Google Sheets.\n- It performs operations like metadata retrieval, sheet management, sharing, permission handling, and exporting.\n- All data flows are from user inputs or API responses into API requests; no suspicious or malicious logic is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- Permission and ownership functions are legitimate features, not indicators of malicious intent.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minimal, typical for API clients with permission management capabilities)\n\nThis detailed review confirms that the code is a legitimate, secure API wrapper with no malicious or sabotage elements.",
