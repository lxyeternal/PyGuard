  "purpose": "Defines static URL constants for Google Sheets and Drive API endpoints, serving as configuration data.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, no input reading or data fetching.",
  "sinks": "None; URLs are used as templates or constants, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static constants used in API requests elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static URL definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static string constants representing API URLs with placeholders. There is no dynamic input, no data processing, no network requests, and no code execution. The URLs are standard, well-documented API endpoints. No secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is a conservative estimate acknowledging potential misuse if these URLs are concatenated improperly elsewhere, but in this isolated snippet, no actual risk exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module defining static API URLs with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
