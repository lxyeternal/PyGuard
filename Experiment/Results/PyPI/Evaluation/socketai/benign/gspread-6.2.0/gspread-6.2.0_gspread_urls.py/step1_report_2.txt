  "purpose": "Define URL constants for Google Sheets and Drive API endpoints used by the gspread library.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, primarily based on static URL templates and string concatenations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any part of the code that uses these URL constants to send HTTP requests, but in this fragment, there are no active data flows or request executions.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; only static URL definitions without runtime data processing or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "None detected. The URL constants appear standard and straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hidden code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides URL constants for Google API endpoints related to spreadsheets and drive files. All URLs are statically assigned with no dynamic or user-provided input processed here. No code execution, data manipulation, or network activity occurs within this snippet. The structure and format are normal for configuration or constants definitions. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are evident. No signs of hardcoded secrets or unusual logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple set of URL constants for Google API endpoints, intended for use elsewhere in the application. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or security risks in this fragment.",
