  "purpose": "Defines URL endpoints for Google Sheets and Drive API interactions.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string constants representing API URLs and URL templates.",
  "sinks": "These URLs are used as endpoints for API requests, which may involve sending or receiving data.",
  "flows": "Application constructs specific API request URLs using these constants, likely inserting identifiers into URL templates.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; URL constants appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static URL strings for Google API endpoints related to spreadsheets and drive files. It uses string concatenation to form URL templates, which are standard for API URL management. There is no dynamic execution, user input processing, or sensitive data handling observed. The URLs are publicly documented endpoints, and no suspicious behaviors, such as malicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of API URL constants used for Google Sheets and Drive API operations. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no signs of security risks. The code appears to serve purely as a URL configuration module for legitimate API interactions.",
