  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n- The code is purely static string constants defining API URLs for Google Sheets and Drive.\n- No dynamic input, no data processing, no network requests, no credentials, and no obfuscated or malicious code.\n- The URLs are standard, well-documented API endpoints, with placeholders for resource identifiers.\n- No signs of malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or supply chain threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues; static URLs, no untrusted input, no malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Fully reasonable.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; static URL constants, no active data flow.\n- **Score justification:** No issues; all scores at 0 or 1 with high confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Static URL definitions, no logic or data flow.\n- **Score justification:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly mention of potential security risk (0.1) because URLs are used in API requests.\n- **Score justification:** Since the code is just constants, the security risk is minimal. The 0.1 score might be slightly overestimated but not unreasonable if considering that misuse of these URLs elsewhere could pose a risk.\n- **Malware score:** 0, no malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; static URL definitions.\n- **Score justification:** Consistent with the others; no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward constants.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, no security flaws, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** All are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in report 4 is slightly conservative but not unreasonable.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- The malware scores should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly at 0.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, with perhaps a slight overestimation in report 4, but still acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly because these URLs could be misused if integrated insecurely elsewhere, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign configuration/constants module for API URLs, with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
