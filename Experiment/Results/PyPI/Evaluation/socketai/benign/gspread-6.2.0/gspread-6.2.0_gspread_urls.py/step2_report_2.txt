  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is purely static URL constants for Google APIs, with no data flow, input, or execution.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risk is 0, which is reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, static URL constants with no dynamic data or execution.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** None. The reasoning is accurate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.1 — perhaps a slight overestimation, but acceptable given the static nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security risk evident.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, static URL definitions with no dynamic or untrusted data handling.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** None. The analysis is consistent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.1 — slightly conservative but reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign configuration code.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—static URL constants, no data processing.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.1 — perhaps a small overestimate, but acceptable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security issues.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, static URL constants with no dynamic input or execution.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static URL constants for Google API endpoints.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, likely due to the potential for misuse if these URLs are combined with untrusted input elsewhere. However, in this isolated snippet, no actual risk exists.  \n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.  \n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at 0, or at most 0.1 to reflect minimal potential if misused in a larger context. Given the static nature, I recommend keeping it at 0.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThis code fragment is benign, serving as a configuration/constants module. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
