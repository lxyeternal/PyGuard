  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code only contains static URL constants without processing untrusted input or executing code.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified as no malicious or risky behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, correctly notes the static nature of the URL constants.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No errors detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; reasonable.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, consistent with previous findings; static URL strings with no active data flow.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores at 0; suitable.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, mentions that URLs are used in API requests, but emphasizes no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No errors.\n- **Scores:** Security risk score is 0.1; perhaps slightly high but still low. Malware and obfuscated are 0, which is consistent.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's nature, 0.1 might be marginally high but acceptable considering the potential for misuse if URLs are concatenated improperly elsewhere. Still, in this fragment, no actual risk is present.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is only static URL definitions with no data processing.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity, code execution, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward static URL definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0 or very close, reflecting minimal to no security risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is purely a constants module defining static API endpoint URLs. There are no signs of malicious intent, dynamic code, obfuscation, or handling of untrusted data. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is acceptable, given the potential for these URLs to be misused if concatenated improperly elsewhere, but in this fragment, no such risk exists.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat in its current form.",
