  "purpose": "Define URL endpoints for Google Sheets and Drive API interactions used by the gspread library.",
  "sources": "String assignments of API URL templates and constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only sets static URL strings without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of string constants defining API endpoint URLs for Google Sheets and Drive APIs. These are standard URL templates with placeholders for IDs. There is no code that accepts input or writes data; no functions, no user input, and no dynamic execution. The URLs are static and sourced from official API documentation. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or credential harvesting mechanisms, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of URL string definitions for API endpoints, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be standard configuration code for a library interfacing with Google APIs.",
