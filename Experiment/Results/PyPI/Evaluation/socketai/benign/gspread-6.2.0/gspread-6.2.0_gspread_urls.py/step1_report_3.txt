  "purpose": "Defines URLs for interacting with Google Sheets and Drive APIs in the gspread library.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URL strings, including API endpoints and URL patterns with placeholders.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code only sets URL constants used elsewhere for API requests.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data processing within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated elements, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively contains static URL string definitions with no logic, data processing, or external input handling. It does not perform any network calls, credential handling, or data manipulation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present. The purpose appears to be configuration or constants setup for API interactions. No signs of malicious activity or security issues are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, consisting solely of URL constants for API endpoints. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as configuration data for the larger gspread library, with no indicators of supply chain threats.",
