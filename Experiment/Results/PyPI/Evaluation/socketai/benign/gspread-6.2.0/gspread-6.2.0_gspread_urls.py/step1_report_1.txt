  "purpose": "Define URLs for Google Sheets and Drive API endpoints used by the gspread library.",
  "sources": "String constants defining API URLs; these are static and do not read untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "These URLs are used to access Google APIs; potential security concern if user input is improperly used in URL formatting.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this snippet; URLs are static or formatted with trusted identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constant URL definitions for Google API endpoints. No input handling, data processing, or untrusted data flows are present. All URLs are static or formatted with placeholder strings, which are meant to be replaced at runtime with trusted identifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a configuration or constants module for API endpoint references.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static URL definitions for Google APIs, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data nor execute any harmful operations.",
