  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes, especially for API errors.\n- Sources: Uses response.json() to parse error info.\n- Sinks: Raises exceptions with parsed error data.\n- Flows: Response parsed in constructor; fallback on JSON parse failure.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code; standard pattern.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Benign, typical error handling code.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard exception handling.\n- No anomalies or malicious code.\n- Confirms straightforward implementation.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar pattern: parsing response JSON, fallback to response.text.\n- No suspicious behaviors or code anomalies.\n- Standard exception class definitions.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above, with emphasis on proper error reporting.\n- No malicious intent or code obfuscation.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly more cautious note: parsing response.json() could expose sensitive info if response contains secrets.\n- No actual malicious code, but notes potential data exposure if response contains secrets.\n- Still, this is standard error handling; the risk is minimal.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (still low)\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is standard exception handling for API responses.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No actual vulnerabilities; the only concern is potential exposure of sensitive info if responses contain secrets, but this is a typical risk with error handling and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate. Security risk scores are very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code is present.\n- The slight security risk noted in some reports pertains to the potential exposure of sensitive info via response.text or response.json(), but this is a known and accepted aspect of error handling, not a security flaw.\n\n### Recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, mostly due to potential info exposure, but not a security flaw)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions.** The code is benign, well-structured, and typical for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the reported scores; they are consistent with the code's nature.",
