  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes for error handling, particularly for API responses and resource access issues. The `APIError` class parses JSON error data from an HTTP response, with a fallback for parsing failures. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard for an API wrapper's error handling module. It uses typical patterns, handles errors responsibly, and does not perform any network or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1 — reasonable, given no malicious behavior but a small risk due to potential untrusted data parsing.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard exception class definitions and safe error parsing. No suspicious or malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** Clear, straightforward, with high confidence (1). No issues detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard exception classes, with JSON parsing of responses and fallback error handling. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with standard error handling. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** Well within expectations for an exception module.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more detailed, noting that `response.json()` could process untrusted data, potentially exposing sensitive info if responses contain secrets. The fallback to `response.text` and error info is standard but could leak data if responses contain sensitive data.\n\n- **Assessment:** While the code is standard, the report correctly flags that parsing untrusted data could pose risks if responses contain secrets or sensitive info. However, this is a common pattern, and the risk is minimal if the API responses are controlled.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2 — slightly higher, but still reasonable considering potential data exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is standard exception handling code, with no malicious activities, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or very low, with the exception of report 5, which notes potential data exposure if responses contain secrets. This is a valid concern but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical exception handling module for an API wrapper library.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The minor security risk score in report 5 is justified due to potential data exposure if responses contain sensitive info, but this is a common risk in error handling and not a security vulnerability per se.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to potential data exposure during JSON parsing, but this is standard and not a security flaw.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears benign, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
