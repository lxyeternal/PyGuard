  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's functionality, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes, particularly for API error handling, with JSON parsing of responses. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard for error handling in an API wrapper. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low), confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score is appropriate. The malware score of 0 is justified. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard exception classes and safe error parsing.\n\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no external data leaks, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard exception classes with JSON parsing and fallback mechanisms. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Analysis:** Typical error handling, no external data flow beyond API response processing.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard exception handling with no suspicious code.\n\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, noting that response.json() could process untrusted data, potentially exposing sensitive info if responses contain secrets.\n\n- **Analysis:** While the code is standard, the report correctly points out that parsing untrusted data could, in theory, lead to data leaks if error responses contain sensitive info. However, this is a common pattern in error handling, and the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score is slightly higher due to potential exposure of error details, but no actual vulnerability or malicious behavior is present. The malware score remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity, code injection, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0 or 0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code, with the exception of Report 5, which cautiously notes potential information exposure but does not identify an actual vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** ~0.1 — minimal security concern mainly related to error message exposure, which is typical in error handling code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe implementation of exception classes for an API client library, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The slight increase in security risk in Report 5 is justified by cautious acknowledgment of potential information exposure, but it does not indicate a real vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes to scores are necessary; the reasoning and scoring are appropriate given the code and context.",
