  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for error handling in the gspread library, particularly for API responses and resource access issues.",
  "sources": "response.json() for parsing error details, response.text as fallback, error object creation.",
  "sinks": "Raises exceptions with parsed error data, potentially exposing response content if untrusted.",
  "flows": "Response data is parsed in the APIError constructor; fallback to response.text; error object stored and used in exception message.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard pattern for API error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements typical exception classes for API error handling, with JSON parsing and fallback mechanisms. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The potential security concern is that response content (including sensitive info) might be exposed if responses contain secrets, but this is inherent to error handling of untrusted data, not a vulnerability. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not perform any network or file operations beyond error parsing. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe exception handling module for API responses, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The slight security risk related to potential data exposure is inherent to error handling and not indicative of a vulnerability. Overall, the code is benign and well-implemented.",
