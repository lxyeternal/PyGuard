  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the gspread library, particularly for API responses and worksheet access issues.",
  "sources": "Exception class initializations, response.json() parsing, and response.text usage in APIError.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions with parsed error data, especially the response.json() and response.text data.",
  "flows": "Response object is parsed for JSON error data in APIError constructor, then used in exception message and stored as object properties.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; error handling follows standard patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for error handling. The APIError class attempts to parse JSON error data from a Response object, falling back to raw text if parsing fails. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leakage beyond standard exception handling. No external data is sent over the network or written to disk. Usage of response.json() is safe within expected context, assuming Response objects are controlled by the library. Overall, the code serves as a typical exception handling module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines exception classes for the gspread library with standard error handling logic. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. It appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions with proper error parsing.",
