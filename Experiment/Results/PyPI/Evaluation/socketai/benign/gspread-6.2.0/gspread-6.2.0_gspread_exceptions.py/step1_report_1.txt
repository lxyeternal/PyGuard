{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in the gspread library, particularly related to API responses and worksheet/spreadsheet access issues.",
  "sources": "Uses the response object from requests library to parse JSON error data in APIError class.",
  "sinks": "The response.json() method is called, which reads data from an HTTP response; no data is sent or written elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The response object is parsed within APIError to extract error details; if parsing fails, fallback error message uses response.text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code performs standard exception handling and logging for API errors. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes, primarily for error handling in gspread. The APIError class attempts to parse JSON error data from an HTTP response, with a fallback for JSON parsing failures. The code does not perform any network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious activities. There are no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious logic, and no indications of malware or sabotage. The structure and functionality are typical for an API wrapper library’s error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign exception handling module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It responsibly handles API error responses and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
