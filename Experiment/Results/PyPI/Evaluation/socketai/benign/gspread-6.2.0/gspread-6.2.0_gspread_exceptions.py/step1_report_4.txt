{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in the gspread library, especially related to API errors, worksheet, and spreadsheet access issues.",
  "sources": "Response object passed to APIError class for extracting error information from API responses.",
  "sinks": "Error details are stored in exception objects and displayed via __str__ and __repr__, but no data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "APIError extracts JSON error info from response; the exception object propagates this info when raised.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code appears straightforward and typical for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes primarily for error reporting. The APIError class attempts to parse JSON error info from a Response object, with fallback error info if parsing fails. No external data flows or suspicious behaviors are evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any network operations or data leaks beyond standard error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception handling implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows.",
