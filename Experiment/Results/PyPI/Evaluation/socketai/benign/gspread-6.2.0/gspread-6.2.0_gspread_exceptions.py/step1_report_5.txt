{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in the gspread library, particularly related to Google Sheets operations and API responses.",
  "sources": "Exception class initializations and the response.json() call within APIError's constructor.",
  "sinks": "The response.json() call could process untrusted data if the response is compromised, leading to potential JSON parsing issues or data leaks. The error message and response text are stored and could be exposed if misused.",
  "flows": "Response object is passed to APIError, which attempts to parse JSON to extract error details. If parsing fails, it uses raw response text and exception info, potentially exposing sensitive data if response contains secrets.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or malicious code patterns detected. Use of exception handling to capture JSON parsing errors is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for error handling within the gspread library. The APIError class processes an HTTP response, attempting to parse JSON error info. In case of failure, it falls back to response text and exception info. This is standard error handling for API responses. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The code operates solely on exception management and data encapsulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard exception handling for API responses within a library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The JSON parsing and error storage could potentially expose error details but are typical for such handlers. Overall, the code is safe.",
