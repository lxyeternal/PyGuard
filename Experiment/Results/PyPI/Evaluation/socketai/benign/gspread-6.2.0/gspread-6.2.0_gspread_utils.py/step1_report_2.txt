  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling Google Sheets ranges, credentials, color conversions, and data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Credential conversion functions, URL extraction functions, input parsing functions, and range processing functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write to external systems or handle untrusted data directly; most functions operate on validated or controlled inputs.",
  "flows": "Function inputs generally originate from user or external sources (e.g., URLs, range names), but functions are designed to handle this safely without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious code or backdoors; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for managing Google Sheets data, credentials, and color formats. Functions like 'extract_id_from_url' parse URLs safely with regexes. Credential conversion functions handle OAuth and service account objects without external calls. Color conversion functions process hex strings and RGB values with validation, avoiding insecure operations. Range handling functions process strings and convert between formats securely. No indicators of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are found. The code relies on standard Python libraries and Google API modules, with no dynamic or unsafe code execution. Overall, this is a well-structured utility module with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of utility functions for Google Sheets operations, credential handling, and color conversions, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
