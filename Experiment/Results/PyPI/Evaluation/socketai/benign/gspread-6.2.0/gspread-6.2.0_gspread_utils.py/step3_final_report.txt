{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for Google Sheets operations, including range conversions, credential handling, color processing, data filling, and URL parsing, aimed at facilitating interactions with Google Sheets API.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns for URL and range parsing, credential objects for OAuth2 and service accounts, input parameters for range and color conversions, and data inputs for filling and transforming sheet data.",
  "sinks": "Functions process data internally; no external sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands are present. Regex extraction and credential conversions are safe and controlled.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., URLs, ranges, color codes) flows through parsing and validation functions, then into conversion or manipulation routines, with no external or unsafe operations involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, obfuscation, or hidden logic detected. The code is straightforward, with standard regexes and data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for Google Sheets, handling range conversions, credential transformations, color encoding, and data filling. It uses standard libraries and regexes for parsing, with proper validation and error handling. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Functions operate on controlled inputs, and the overall structure is clear and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility module for Google Sheets operations, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the utility nature of the code.",
