  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling Google Sheets data, including range conversions, credentials handling, color conversions, and list manipulations.",
  "sources": "Input data from URLs, function parameters, and external credentials modules.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity; code mainly processes and transforms data internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as URLs, parameters, or external credentials into internal functions for processing and output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks detected. No unusual or misleading code structures found. The code uses standard libraries and API interaction patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions related to Google Sheets, such as converting cell references, parsing URLs, handling credentials, and color conversions. The credential conversion functions handle OAuth2 tokens and service account info in a typical manner. The range and cell address functions follow standard patterns. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, such as hidden network activity, reverse shells, or data exfiltration routines. No external network calls or sensitive data handling that could be malicious are present. The only potential concern is the function 'extract_id_from_url' which parses URLs for IDs, but this is standard URL parsing for API use. Overall, the code appears to be safe utility code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains standard utility functions for Google Sheets manipulation and credential handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code operates on data transformation and API interaction, with no suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines.",
