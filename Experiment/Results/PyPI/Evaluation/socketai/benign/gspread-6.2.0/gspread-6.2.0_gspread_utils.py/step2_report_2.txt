  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, consistency of scores, and potential security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The module is a utility collection for Google Sheets, with functions for range conversion, credentials handling, color processing, data filling, etc.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious behaviors. Functions perform standard parsing, validation, and data manipulation. Credentials are converted safely, URL parsing is straightforward, and no obfuscated code or network activity is detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, given the utility nature and safe handling.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, appropriate given the thorough reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe handling of credentials, URL parsing, range, and color conversions.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Functions are straightforward, and regexes are used for parsing URLs and ranges.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified by detailed reasoning.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is sound. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for Google Sheets, with focus on range, credentials, and color processing.\n- **Findings:** No network activity, code injection, or suspicious operations. Functions are standard, safe, and rely on well-known libraries.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, very low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on data parsing, credentials, and range handling.\n- **Findings:** No external calls beyond parsing; functions operate on controlled inputs. URL parsing and credential handling are standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity detected; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for range, credentials, colors, and data manipulation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation. Regexes are straightforward, and credential handling is standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** The code is benign and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, mostly due to the utility nature and safe handling.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in each report are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No changes needed; all evidence points to a safe, utility-focused module.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to utility code but no real security concern)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a well-structured utility module for Google Sheets operations, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and appropriate.",
