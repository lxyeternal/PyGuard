  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logical consistency, potential security issues, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of utility functions for Google Sheets, handling range conversions, credentials, colors, etc. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or network activity is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning aligns with the code review; no malicious code or suspicious activity is evident.\n- The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, possibly due to the handling of credentials, but the functions are standard and safe.\n- The malware score is correctly low, as no malicious code is present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring seems reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the safety of credential handling, URL parsing, and data processing functions. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is thorough, confirming the absence of malicious code.\n- The malware score is appropriate.\n- The confidence is high; the analysis aligns with the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for Google Sheets, with safe URL parsing, credential handling, and color conversions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or network calls.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis is consistent with the code.\n- The securityRisk is minimal, given the functions' nature.\n- Malware score is correctly low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are justified. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for range conversions, credentials, and data manipulation. No evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or code injection.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is sound; the functions are standard and safe.\n- The malware score is appropriate.\n- The confidence is high.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring is consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on safe parsing, credential handling, and data transformations. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning aligns with the code.\n- The low security risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a zero score, as no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting the handling of credentials and URL parsing, but these are standard operations with no malicious intent.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No signs of malicious code or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to credential handling, but overall very low.\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a utility module for Google Sheets, performing data parsing, conversions, and credential management safely. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1            |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reasoning above.",
