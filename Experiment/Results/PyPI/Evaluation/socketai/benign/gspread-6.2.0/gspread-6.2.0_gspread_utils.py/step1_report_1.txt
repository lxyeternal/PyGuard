{
  "purpose": "The module provides utility functions for handling Google Sheets, including range conversions, credentials handling, color conversions, and data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Inputs from user inputs (such as URLs, range strings, color hex codes), external data sources (like credentials objects), and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network requests (implied via credentials conversions, though actual network code is not present), data transformations, and external API interactions through credentials and URL parsing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (URLs, credentials, cell ranges, color codes) through validation and transformation functions, without executing external commands or code injection. Credentials are converted internally; range and color strings are parsed and converted, with no malicious code execution evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard parsing, conversion, and data manipulation. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden network activity detected. The only sensitive operations are credentials conversion, which are handled safely, and URL parsing, which could potentially expose URL components, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for handling Google Sheets data, range conversions, credential conversions, color processing, and data filling. There are no network connections, external command executions, or code evaluations. All functions perform standard parsing, validation, and data manipulation. Credential handling involves conversion between different credential types, but no insecure practices are apparent. The URL parsing functions extract identifiers without performing unsafe operations. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are visible. Overall, the code appears safe and aligned with expected utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions for Google Sheets handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs data parsing, conversion, and manipulation in a safe manner. No network activity, code injection, or hidden behaviors are detected. The malware score is very low, indicating no malicious intent.",
