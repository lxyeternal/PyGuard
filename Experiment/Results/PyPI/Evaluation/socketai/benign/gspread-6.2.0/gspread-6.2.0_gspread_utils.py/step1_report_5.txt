  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling Google Sheets operations, including range conversions, credentials management, and data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URL parsing (extract_id_from_url), range strings (a1_range_to_grid_range, is_full_a1_notation), and cell lists (cell_list_to_rect). Credential conversion functions process credentials objects. Data manipulation functions read and process lists and strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data sinks include URL parsing (extract_id_from_url), range string handling (a1_range_to_grid_range, to_records), and color conversions (convert_hex_to_colors_dict, convert_colors_to_hex_value). No direct data leaks or unsafe executions are apparent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters like URLs and range strings into regex extraction or parsing functions; credentials objects flow into conversion functions; range and cell data flow into range and grid functions; color data flow into color conversion functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Use of regexes for URL parsing is standard. Credential conversion functions handle standard OAuth2 and service account credentials. No obfuscated code features or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of utility functions for parsing and converting spreadsheet ranges, handling credentials, processing color codes, and manipulating list data. All functions operate on well-defined inputs and produce expected outputs. Regexes used for URL and range parsing are straightforward. Credential conversions rely on standard libraries with no suspicious code. No functions execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or access environment variables. Data flows are typical for spreadsheet utilities, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of standard utility functions for Google Sheets interactions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely handles data conversions, range parsing, and credential management without any suspicious or harmful code. Overall security risk is very low.",
