  "purpose": "Module initializer for a Google Spreadsheets API client library, importing components and defining public API exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules and package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, network communication, or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external sources or sinks; purely static import/export setup.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard package setup with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script, importing various modules and setting the __all__ attribute for public API exposure. It contains no logic, data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. All indicators point to a benign, structural setup typical for Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign package initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores provided are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
