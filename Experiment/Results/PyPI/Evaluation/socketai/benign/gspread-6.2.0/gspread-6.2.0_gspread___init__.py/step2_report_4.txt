  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports identify this code as a straightforward package initializer (__init__.py or similar), importing modules and defining exports.\n- No evidence of data processing, network activity, or handling untrusted inputs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the above.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- It only imports modules and defines `__all__`.\n- No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or secret handling.\n- No external data flows or network activity within this snippet.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent; no logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The code is standard for a package's main module or __init__ file.\n- No issues with the scoring; all assigned scores seem appropriate.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk, raising scores would be unjustified.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is purely structural.\n- The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors, so no challenge needed.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code content.\n- The analysis aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign package initializer with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, straightforward, and free of security concerns. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
