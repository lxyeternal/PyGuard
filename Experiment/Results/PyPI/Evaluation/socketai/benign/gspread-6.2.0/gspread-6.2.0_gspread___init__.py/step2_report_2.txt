  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module initializer for a Google Spreadsheets API Python package.\n- No data flows, input handling, or network operations are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code simply imports modules and defines the __all__ attribute, serving as an API interface.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any logic that could be malicious or introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- The reported scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence level is high (1) across all reports, indicating consensus.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this code is a benign package setup file.\n- There are no assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities that are unsupported by the code.\n- Since the code is purely import/export declarations, there are no hidden or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- Security risk: 0 (no evident security issues)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments. The code is a standard, safe package initializer with no security concerns.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No further action needed.\n- The code is safe and does not pose any security threat.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to review any other code snippets or reports.",
