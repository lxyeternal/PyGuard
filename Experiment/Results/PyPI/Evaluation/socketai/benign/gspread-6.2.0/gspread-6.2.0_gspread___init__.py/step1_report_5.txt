  "flows": "No active data flows are present within this snippet; it primarily sets up module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is a straightforward re-export of modules with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package module, defining metadata and importing various components for a Google Spreadsheets API wrapper. It contains no input handling, no network communication, and no dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. All imported modules and objects appear to serve legitimate API functionalities. The structure is conventional, and the code is clear and well-organized.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines module exports for a Google Spreadsheets API library. No malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
