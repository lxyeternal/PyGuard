{
  "purpose": "Represents a single spreadsheet cell with methods for address conversion, value comparison, and numeric interpretation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (row, col, value), utility functions (a1_to_rowcol, numericise, rowcol_to_a1)",
  "sinks": "None; data is processed locally without external interactions",
  "flows": "Input data -> utility functions -> class attributes and methods",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data handling and conversion",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Cell class with methods for initialization, address parsing, representation, equality, and value interpretation. It relies on external utility functions presumed safe. No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code handles data internally, converting addresses and numeric values securely. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are detected. The overall structure is simple and purpose-specific, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data model for spreadsheet cells with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It performs safe data conversions and comparisons without external interactions or obfuscation.",
