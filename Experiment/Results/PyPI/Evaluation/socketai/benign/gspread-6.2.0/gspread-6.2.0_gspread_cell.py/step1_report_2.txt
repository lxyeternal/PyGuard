{
  "purpose": "Defines a Cell class representing a single cell in a Google Sheets worksheet, including methods for creation, comparison, and property access.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'label' parameter in from_address method and self.value property.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident that process untrusted data in a way that could lead to security issues. No network or file system operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input label processed via a1_to_rowcol to derive row and column; self.value used for display and numeric conversion. No data flows into potentially dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscated constructs, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code strictly handles data representation without external system interactions.",
  "analysis": "The class manages cell data, converting between A1 notation and row/column indices, and provides numeric interpretation of cell values. All functions rely on external utility functions (a1_to_rowcol, numericise, rowcol_to_a1) presumed safe. No code injection, network, or file system access is present. No indications of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are found. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model for spreadsheet cells, with no malicious or security risk indicators. It functions solely as a data container and formatter, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
