  "purpose": "This code provides various authentication mechanisms for accessing Google Sheets and Drive via OAuth2, service accounts, and API keys, enabling clients to securely connect to Google APIs.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., 'APPDATA'), JSON credential files (credentials.json, authorized_user.json, service_account.json), and optional user info or credential dictionaries provided as arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses credentials to instantiate a Google API client; no direct data leakage or external effect is evident. Credentials are loaded from local files or passed as dictionaries, and OAuth flows involve opening URLs or running local servers.",
  "flows": "Credentials are loaded from files or generated via OAuth flows; the flow involves reading local config, running OAuth authorization (via local_server_flow), and storing credentials. No untrusted data is executed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected. OAuth flow creates local server, but this is standard. No unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors identified. The environment variable usage appears standard. No code injection points or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code predominantly manages OAuth and service account authentication by loading credentials from local files or via OAuth flows, with optional scopes. It uses environment variables and local files for configuration, which are typical. The flow functions involve standard OAuth web server and console flows. The functions for storing and loading credentials handle JSON files securely. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code patterns are detected. The only potential concern is the use of environment variables and local web server flows, but these are standard practices for OAuth integration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard OAuth and service account authentication procedures with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It safely manages credential loading, storage, and OAuth flows without executing untrusted code or leaking sensitive information beyond expected scope. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are apparent.",
