{
  "purpose": "The code implements a schema utility for creating and managing tagged union types with metadata validation, dynamic class modifications, and type safety mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Class attributes, type hints, metadata keys, and class initialization methods that read and validate metadata and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Attribute accessors like __get__, get_tagged function, and class attribute modifications; no external data flows or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Metadata keys and type hints are read during class initialization; get_tagged reads instance attributes to determine active tag and value.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __new__, dynamic class modifications in __init_subclass__, and reliance on external metadata are standard for schema systems but could be manipulated if metadata is maliciously crafted. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for tagged unions with validation, uses standard Python features such as dataclasses, descriptors, and type hints. It performs validation against invalid metadata keys, dynamically modifies class annotations, and provides mechanisms to retrieve tagged values. No malicious code, backdoors, or external system interactions are detected. The use of __get__ raising NotImplementedError is typical for descriptors. The dynamic class modifications are part of schema management, not malicious activity. The code's purpose aligns with schema validation and type safety, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. External metadata could be manipulated, but this is a common concern in schema libraries and not specific to this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a schema utility for tagged unions, performing validation and dynamic class setup without malicious behavior. No malware or malicious activity is evident. The minimal security risk stems from reliance on external metadata and type hints, which is typical for such libraries but does not indicate malicious intent.",
