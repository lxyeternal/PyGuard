{
  "purpose": "This code defines generic classes and functions to implement tagged unions in Python, using metadata and dataclasses for structured data modeling.",
  "sources": "Reads class attributes, type hints, and metadata; accesses class dictionaries and annotations; processes input keyword arguments in constructors.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted input; no network, file, or environment variable access; no dynamic code execution or eval statements.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from constructor kwargs into class attributes; metadata is checked during class initialization; tag extraction uses attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; use of standard Python features and libraries; no unusual dynamic execution, eval, or import tricks.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured around defining tagged unions with type safety and metadata validation. It employs standard Python features like dataclasses, type hints, and generic classes. Metadata validation ensures only specific keys are used. The constructor enforces a single active tag. The __init_subclass__ method dynamically modifies class annotations and creates Tag instances for each field. There are no indications of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or sabotage behaviors. The overall design appears to be a well-structured utility for type-safe tagged unions, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of tagged unions using dataclasses and type hints, with validation checks on metadata and constructor arguments. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It is safe and focused on type safety and data modeling.",
