  "purpose": "Define generic tagging system for union types with metadata validation and schema generation.",
  "sources": "Class attribute access, type hints, __init__, __post_init__, get_type_hints, getattr, setattr, __get__ methods, and constructor (__init__).",
  "sinks": "get_type_hints, getattr, setattr, and __get__ method could potentially access or manipulate class or instance attributes, but none are used insecurely. No direct data leaks or malicious data flows observed.",
  "flows": "Constructor reads kwargs -> __init__ sets attributes -> __repr__ calls get_tagged -> get_tagged reads attributes -> __get__ method raises NotImplementedError if accessed directly. Type hints influence __init_subclass__ processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior detected. Use of __get__ raising NotImplementedError is normal for a descriptor, no malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a system for tagged unions with type validation, metadata, and schema generation. Uses standard Python features like dataclasses, type hints, and descriptors. No network, file, or external system access. No suspicious data flows or obfuscated patterns. The code validates metadata, dynamically creates subclasses, and manages attribute tagging, all in a typical manner for such schema tools. No malicious behavior or malware signals detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a tagging system with metadata validation and schema generation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation for a type schema library.",
