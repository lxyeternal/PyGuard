{
  "purpose": "Defines a generic tagging system for creating tagged unions with metadata validation and type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (dataclasses, typing) and third-party modules (apischema). Uses class attributes, type hints, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks found; code primarily defines classes and functions for data modeling. No network or system I/O, no eval or exec, no database queries.",
  "flows": "The code initializes tagged union classes, validates metadata, and assigns tags and types. The get_tagged function retrieves the active tag and value.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Uses standard Python features for type safety and data modeling. No obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a tagging system with classes Tag, Tagged, and TaggedUnion, with type validation and runtime checks for metadata. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks detected. The code validates metadata against a set of invalid keys, ensures only proper fields are used in subclasses, and constructs tagged union instances with proper attribute assignments. Overall, the implementation appears to be a straightforward data modeling utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a secure, purpose-specific implementation for creating tagged union data structures with metadata validation. No malicious behavior or malware features are present. It primarily handles data validation and type safety, with no evident security risks.",
