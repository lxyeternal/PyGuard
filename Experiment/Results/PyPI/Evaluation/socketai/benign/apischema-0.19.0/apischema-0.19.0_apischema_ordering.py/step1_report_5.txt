{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and functions to manage ordering metadata for classes and their attributes, enabling customized sorting based on specified ordering rules.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (__arg, before, after), collection elements (elts), and class types (cls). It also reads class attributes and imported functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data flow could occur if untrusted input is passed into the decorators or functions, especially through __arg, before, or after parameters. No network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (__arg, before, after) flow into ordering logic, which then influences sorting and class metadata. These flows are internal and controlled; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage of import from external libraries appears standard. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an ordering system via dataclasses and decorators, allowing customization of attribute ordering in classes. It uses standard patterns like class decorators, metadata management, and sorting algorithms. The functions rely on external libraries (apischema), which are assumed to be benign. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated logic, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to implement legitimate ordering and sorting functionality with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured utility for managing ordering metadata in Python classes, with no apparent malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. It relies on external libraries, but their usage appears standard. Overall, it poses low security risk.",
