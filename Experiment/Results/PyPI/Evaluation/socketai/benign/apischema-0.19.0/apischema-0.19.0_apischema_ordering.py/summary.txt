  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for managing class attribute ordering, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should be zero, and the risk score should be around 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal concern primarily due to the validation function. Overall, it is safe for supply chain use."
