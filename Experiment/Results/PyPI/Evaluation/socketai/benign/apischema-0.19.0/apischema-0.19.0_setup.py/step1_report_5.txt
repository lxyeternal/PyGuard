{
  "purpose": "To define and configure optional C extensions for the 'apischema' package based on environment and platform conditions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), platform information (platform.python_implementation()), code defining extensions",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable sources could include environment variables if misused, but in this context, no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and platform info influence whether C extensions are included in setup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior. The code dynamically includes C extensions based on environment and platform, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'platform' to determine the environment and platform. It constructs a list of C extension modules for 'deserialization' and 'serialization', conditioned on the platform not being PyPy and the 'NO_EXTENSION' environment variable not being set. The setup function then registers these extensions. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious instructions. The dynamic inclusion of extensions is standard in Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for conditionally including C extensions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard environment checks before adding extensions.",
