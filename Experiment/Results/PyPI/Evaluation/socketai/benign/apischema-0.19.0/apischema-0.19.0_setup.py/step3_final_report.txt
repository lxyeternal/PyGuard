  "purpose": "Conditional setup of C extension modules for 'apischema' based on environment and platform.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'NO_EXTENSION', platform.python_implementation()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or dangerous sinks; standard build configuration",
  "flows": "Environment variable and platform check influence inclusion of extension modules",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and standard for build scripts",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, platform, and setuptools; constructs a list of Extension objects for 'deserialization' and 'serialization' modules, conditioned on platform not being 'PyPy' and 'NO_EXTENSION' not being set. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The logic is typical for optional C extension building, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, environment-aware setup configuration with no malicious or security concerns. The environment variable check is standard practice and does not indicate malicious activity. All signals point to a safe, straightforward build script.",
