{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for handling Python type annotations, including compatibility layers for different Python versions, type resolution, and introspection tools.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard modules (sys, types, typing, typing_extensions), and variables/functions that access or manipulate type hints and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data; the code mainly performs introspection and type analysis without user input handling or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "The functions process input objects (types, classes, annotations) through various helper functions, resolving type hints, checking types, and retrieving type parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional imports and fallback implementations for compatibility across Python versions, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code does not perform network access, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script is a utility module for Python type annotations, primarily focusing on compatibility and type introspection across different Python versions. It uses standard practices for checking and resolving types, with fallbacks to maintain compatibility. No signs of malicious code, such as code injection, backdoors, or covert data collection, are present. The code appears well-structured for its purpose, with safeguards against deprecated or unavailable features. The use of a fake type and multiple fallback import strategies are typical for ensuring broad compatibility and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for type hint handling with no malicious behavior detected. It uses standard, non-suspicious techniques for compatibility and type introspection. Overall, the risk is very low.",
