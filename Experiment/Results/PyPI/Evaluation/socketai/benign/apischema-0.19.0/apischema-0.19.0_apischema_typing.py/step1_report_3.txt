{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities for Python's type hinting system across different Python versions, including functions to resolve, analyze, and manipulate type annotations and generics.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from imported modules such as sys, types, and typing_extensions, and also inspects attributes of types and classes, including __origin__, __args__, __parameters__, __orig_bases__, and __dict__.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that execute untrusted data or perform harmful actions. It mainly performs introspection on type objects and class attributes.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve inspecting type annotations, retrieving type hints, and resolving type parameters, primarily for type analysis. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard compatibility and utility functions for type hinting with no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. Usage of private attributes like __orig_bases__, __parameters__, and get_args is consistent with type introspection rather than malicious intent. No unusual code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or obfuscated code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The module primarily facilitates type hinting compatibility and analysis, handling differences across Python versions. It conditionally imports functions from 'typing' and 'typing_extensions', defines helper functions for type analysis (e.g., is_union, is_literal), and manages internal structures for generics. The code contains no network access, data leakage, or code execution of untrusted input. No signs of malware, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior, are evident. All operations are consistent with a type analysis library. The initial checks for module imports and version compatibility are standard. Overall, the code appears safe and intended solely for internal utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of compatibility and utility functions for Python's typing system, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It performs introspection and type analysis without executing untrusted data or performing harmful actions.",
