  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling Python type annotations across multiple Python versions, including fallback implementations and introspection helpers.",
  "sources": "Type hint definitions, internal attributes (__orig_bases__, __parameters__, __wrapped__), standard library modules, and third-party typing_extensions imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no network or file operations, no data exfiltration or external communication.",
  "flows": "The code performs internal type analysis and introspection without external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal/private attributes and dynamic fallback mechanisms are typical for compatibility layers, not malicious anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility layer for Python's typing system, employing conditional imports, fallback functions, and internal attribute access to support multiple Python versions. It includes functions for resolving type hints, checking type properties, and handling generics. No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code is present. The use of internal attributes and fallback implementations is standard in such utility modules. The code's structure and purpose are transparent, and it aligns with common practices for type handling across Python versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for Python type annotations and compatibility. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are consistent with its purpose and implementation.",
