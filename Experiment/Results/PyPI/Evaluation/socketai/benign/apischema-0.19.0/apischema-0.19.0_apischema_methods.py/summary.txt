  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for method inspection, wrapping, and registration, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. The potential risk stems from executing property getters, which could be malicious if properties are poorly designed, but this is outside static analysis scope. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for metaprogramming purposes."
