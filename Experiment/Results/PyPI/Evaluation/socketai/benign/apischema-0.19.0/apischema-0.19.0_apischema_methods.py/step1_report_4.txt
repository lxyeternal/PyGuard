{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes to analyze, wrap, and register class methods and properties, primarily for metaprogramming purposes such as decorators, method wrappers, and type introspection.",
  "sources": "Code reads method and property attributes, function signatures, and type hints; uses inspect module to analyze functions and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Method wrappers invoke getattr and call methods dynamically; get_type_hints may access type annotations; register function is called with methods and class info.",
  "flows": "Code flows from inspecting method attributes and type hints to creating wrappers and registering methods, often passing functions as arguments to register, which then may invoke attribute access or method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated or suspicious logic; functions perform standard metaprogramming operations. The code relies on dynamic attribute access and method wrapping, which are typical in decorator implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements method/property introspection, dynamic method wrapping, and registration mechanisms. It uses standard Python modules and patterns for metaprogramming. No external network access, data exfiltration, or malicious side effects are present. The dynamic nature of attribute access and method invocation is typical for such utilities and does not suggest malicious intent. The functions and classes serve legitimate purposes such as method decoration and registration, with no signs of harmful behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for method and property management in Python, focusing on introspection, wrapping, and registration. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The dynamic attribute and method handling are typical and safe within the context of metaprogramming. Overall, this code is benign.",
