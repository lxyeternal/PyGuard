{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for inspecting, wrapping, and registering class methods and properties, likely for metaprogramming or framework development.",
  "sources": "None of the functions explicitly read untrusted input or external data sources; code operates on function/method objects and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write to files, execute external commands, or transmit data over networks. They mainly manipulate method objects and attributes within Python runtime.",
  "flows": "The code performs flow from method inspection to method wrapping and registration, mostly within the local runtime context. No external data flow or untrusted input processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The use of method wrapping and dynamic attribute setting appears standard for metaprogramming; no obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements utility functions to identify if an object is a method or property, locate method definitions within class hierarchies, wrap methods with decorators, and register these methods with additional metadata. The functions operate purely within Python's reflection system, without external data handling or suspicious behavior. The method_wrapper function adds attributes to wrapped functions, and method_registerer registers methods via a provided callback, all standard practices in Python metaprogramming. No malicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or covert network activity, are present. The code's complexity is consistent with metaprogramming utilities, not malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for method inspection, wrapping, and registration. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It is a standard metaprogramming toolset with no suspicious anomalies.",
