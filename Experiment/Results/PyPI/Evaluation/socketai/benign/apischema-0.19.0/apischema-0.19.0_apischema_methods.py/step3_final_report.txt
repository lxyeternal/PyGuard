  "purpose": "Utility functions for inspecting, wrapping, and registering class methods and properties, primarily for metaprogramming and schema purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads method signatures, global variables, class attributes, and property getters via reflection and get_type_hints.",
  "sinks": "Uses getattr, setattr, and dynamic registration functions; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source: method definitions and class globals; Sink: getattr/setattr and registration calls; Flow: method inspection leading to registration or wrapping.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, backdoors, or secrets; reliance on property getters could execute malicious code if properties are maliciously designed, but outside static scope.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard reflection and metaprogramming techniques for method inspection, wrapping, and registration. No external data fetching, network activity, or file operations are present. The main concern is that property getters could contain malicious code, but static analysis cannot determine this. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The use of get_type_hints and dynamic attribute access is typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for method inspection, wrapping, and registration, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. The potential risk stems from executing property getters, which could be malicious if properties are poorly designed, but this is outside static analysis scope. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for metaprogramming purposes.",
