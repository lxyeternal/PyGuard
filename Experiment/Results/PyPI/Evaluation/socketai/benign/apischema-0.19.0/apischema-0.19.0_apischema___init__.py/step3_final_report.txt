{
  "purpose": "The code manages module exports, handles optional dependencies (notably 'graphql-core'), issues version warnings, and registers default conversions for validation errors. It serves as setup and configuration code for a Python schema/serialization library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version check conditions, and dynamic attribute access (__getattr__) for optional 'graphql' support.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data input or output, network access, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version checks are static; __getattr__ raises errors if 'graphql' is accessed without dependency, but this is controlled and benign.",
  "anomalies": "Benign version warnings; no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup with import management, optional dependency handling, and registration of conversions. It includes a version check warning for incompatible 'graphql-core' versions, which is informative but not security-critical. The dynamic __getattr__ method provides user guidance if 'graphql' is accessed without the dependency installed. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's structure and content are straightforward and typical for a library initialization module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, primarily due to benign version warnings. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness.",
