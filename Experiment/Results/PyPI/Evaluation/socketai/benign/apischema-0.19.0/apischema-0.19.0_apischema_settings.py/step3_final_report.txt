  "purpose": "Configuration classes and utility functions for the 'apischema' library, managing schema settings, cache invalidation, and serialization/deserialization options.",
  "sources": "Class attributes, properties, lambda defaults, and cache reset calls within class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network activity, or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "Configuration values assigned via class attributes and lambdas; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambdas as default values and cache reset in metaclasses are unusual but standard patterns in configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for configuration and utility purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The lambdas serve as default callables, and cache resets are standard cache invalidation techniques. No network activity, secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and intended for configuration management within 'apischema'. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
