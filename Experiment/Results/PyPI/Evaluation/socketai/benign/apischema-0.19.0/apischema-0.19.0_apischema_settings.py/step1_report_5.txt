{
  "purpose": "The code defines configuration and settings classes for a schema validation and serialization library, including cache management, schema property defaults, error messages, and deserialization/serialization options.",
  "sources": "Class property definitions, import statements, lambda functions, and constants assigned within class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous if user-supplied data influences schema validation or cache behavior, but no explicit sink is present in this code.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets static configuration parameters and utility functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda functions for configuration, including cache reset logic within the ResetCache class; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected. No dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes classes and properties for managing schema validation settings, including cache reset mechanisms. No external inputs or outputs, network calls, or data leaks are present. The cache reset in ResetCache is a standard pattern to ensure cache invalidation. The use of lambda functions for default behaviors is typical and not suspicious. Overall, the code appears to be configuration and utility code for a schema validation library, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration and utility setup for schema validation, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs no network activity, data leaks, or backdoors. The use of cache reset and configuration lambdas is standard practice.",
