  "purpose": "Implement a convolution-based KDE estimator using FFT for fast density estimation on equidistant grids.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input arguments in fit() and evaluate() methods; reads grid points, weights, kernel parameters, and data array internally.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects; the code primarily processes data for statistical estimation without external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data is taken from fit() or evaluate() inputs → processed through binning and kernel computations → convolved to produce KDE estimates.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious function calls. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of warnings.catch_warnings() to suppress warnings, which is standard practice. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a KDE class using FFT for efficient computation. It performs data validation, grid checks, and performs kernel convolution. It imports standard scientific libraries and local modules for binning and utils. No external or network interactions are present. The code does not include hidden or malicious functions, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The warning suppression is a typical approach to manage known library warnings. Overall, the implementation appears to be a straightforward statistical utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a KDE estimator using FFT. It contains no suspicious, malicious, or maliciously behaving code. The suppression of warnings is typical and does not indicate malicious activity. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
