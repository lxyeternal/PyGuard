{
  "purpose": "This class implements a convolution (FFT) based computation of a KDE, enabling fast density estimation on equidistant grids with constant bandwidth.",
  "sources": "Data points from the 'data' array, grid points from 'grid_points', optional weights from 'weights'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data processed in-memory; no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Data is fitted via 'fit', validated, binned with 'linear_binning', kernel weights computed, convolved with 'convolve', and results returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; warnings suppressed during convolution, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of FFT-based KDE, relying on common scientific libraries. It performs in-memory data processing, validation, and computation without external system interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The suppression of warnings is typical and not malicious. The use of pytest in the main block is standard for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard statistical utility implementing FFT-based KDE with no malicious or obfuscated components. The security risk is minimal, and the current scores are appropriate.",
