{
  "purpose": "Implement a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for univariate or multivariate data with support for different kernels and bandwidth selection.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to fit() method; optional grid_points parameter in evaluate(); internal data attributes such as self.data and self.weights.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network or file system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from fit() to internal attributes; evaluate() processes self.data and self.grid_points; kernel calculations and convolution process the data, but no untrusted external data influence is evident beyond input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of warnings.catch_warnings is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or file manipulations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a KDE using FFT, with careful validation of input data, grid, and bandwidth. It relies on established libraries (NumPy, SciPy, and internal KDEpy utilities). The process involves binning data, computing kernel weights, and convolving, all in memory. No code indicates malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The only potential concern could be improper use of data, but that is outside the scope of this module. The code appears well-structured, standard, and free from suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard implementation of FFT-based KDE with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs statistical computations securely and in accordance with typical practices. No malicious intent or malicious code segments are detected.",
