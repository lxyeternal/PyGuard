{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a kernel density estimator (KDE) using FFT convolution for efficient computation, allowing flexible kernel selection and grid evaluation.",
  "sources": "Data input from the 'fit' method (self.data and self.weights), grid points provided to 'evaluate', internal computations of kernel weights and data binning.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the return of the evaluated KDE results. No other sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data is read during 'fit' and 'evaluate'; kernel weights are computed internally; convolve function processes data and kernel weights; results are returned after processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. Usage of warnings.catch_warnings and assertions are standard. No obfuscated or misleading code identified. External library functions appear typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard KDE via FFT convolution, with no signs of malicious intent. It securely processes data, performs in-memory calculations, and returns numerical results. The use of standard libraries (numpy, scipy) and well-structured class design suggests typical statistical computation without covert operations. No network activity, file I/O, or system manipulation code observed. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code does not exhibit obfuscation or hidden functionalities. All computations are in-memory and for data analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a kernel density estimation algorithm using FFT, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It adheres to standard statistical computation patterns and uses open-source libraries in a typical manner.",
