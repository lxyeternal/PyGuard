  "purpose": "Implementation of a Kernel Density Estimation using FFT-based convolution for efficient computation, primarily for statistical analysis of data distributions.",
  "sources": "Input data from the `fit()` method (parameter `data`), optional `weights` parameter; grid points from `evaluate()` method (parameter `grid_points`), and internal attributes like `self.data`, `self.weights`, `self.grid_points`, `self.bw`, and `self.kernel`.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data directly; the code mainly performs numerical operations and validations. No network, file I/O, or external system calls are present that could lead to data leaks or injection.",
  "flows": "Input data and weights flow into the `fit()` method, are stored internally. During `evaluate()`, data is binned and convolved with kernel weights, which are computed internally. The flow is data -> binning -> kernel weight calculation -> convolution -> return result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present. The code performs standard statistical computations with clear validation checks.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class `FFTKDE` that performs KDE via FFT convolution, with parameters for kernel choice and bandwidth. The `fit()` method stores data and optional weights. The `evaluate()` method creates a grid, checks its sorting, ensures data points are within the grid, computes binning, kernel weights, and performs convolution with warnings suppressed for performance. No external system interactions, network activity, or file manipulations are observed. The code is structured logically with appropriate input validation. Overall, the implementation appears to be a standard, well-structured statistical method without malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of FFT-based KDE with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs numerical calculations for statistical density estimation and includes proper validation checks. No suspicious or malicious activities are evident. The code's purpose is legitimate and aligned with statistical data analysis tasks.",
