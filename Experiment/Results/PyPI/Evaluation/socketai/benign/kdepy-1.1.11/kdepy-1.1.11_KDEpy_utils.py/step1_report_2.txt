{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for generating Cartesian products of arrays and automatically creating grid points for data visualization or analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data to autogrid (data parameter), user-defined parameters such as boundary_abs, boundary_rel, and num_points.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful way; no network, file, or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through calculations in autogrid to generate grid points; cartesian generates Cartesian product from arrays. No external data flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code primarily performs mathematical operations and data transformations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for generating Cartesian products and data grids. It imports 'numbers' and 'numpy', both standard libraries for numerical computations. The functions handle input validation, data processing, and mathematical calculations without executing system commands or network operations. The main block runs pytest with specific arguments, which is standard for testing and does not introduce malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns detected. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility module for scientific or data analysis purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for data grid and Cartesian product generation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware. The overall security risk score is very low.",
