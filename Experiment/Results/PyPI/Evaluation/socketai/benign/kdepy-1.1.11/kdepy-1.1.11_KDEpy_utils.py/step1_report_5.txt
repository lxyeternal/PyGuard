  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for generating cartesian products and automatic grid calculation for data analysis.",
  "sources": "np.asarray, data.min, data.max, data.shape, np.linspace",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data influences critical operations or external systems",
  "flows": "Input data flows through min, max, and shape calculations, then used in cartesian and linspace functions for grid creation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of assert statements for input validation is standard, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two main functions: 'cartesian' generates a Cartesian product of input arrays; 'autogrid' calculates a grid based on data with optional boundary and resolution parameters. Data is processed with numpy functions, with no external network access, eval, exec, or other suspicious operations. The main block runs pytest for doctest validation, which is standard. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for data grid and Cartesian product generation, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not handle sensitive data insecurely nor perform any suspicious operations.",
