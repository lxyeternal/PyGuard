  "purpose": "Utility functions for Cartesian product generation and automatic grid creation for data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data shape, min, max, and range from input data; no external data sources or untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks, network operations, or data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "Input data -> min/max/range calculations -> grid generation via linspace -> cartesian product -> output grid.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard numpy operations for Cartesian products and grid creation with proper validation and documentation. No external data sources, sinks, or system commands are used. The functions are straightforward, with input validation ensuring correctness. The main block runs pytest for testing, which is typical and safe. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for numerical data processing. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk (0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
