  "sources": "np.asarray, np.indices, np.empty_like, np.linspace, data.min, data.max, data.shape, enumerate",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through numpy functions; no user input flows into sensitive or dangerous functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code mainly handles mathematical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions 'cartesian' and 'autogrid' for generating Cartesian products and data grids. It uses numpy for numerical operations, with proper handling of parameters, input validation, and no indications of malicious code. The presence of a main block running pytest is typical for testing and does not indicate malicious activity. No obfuscated code, no network operations, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate utility functions for data processing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
