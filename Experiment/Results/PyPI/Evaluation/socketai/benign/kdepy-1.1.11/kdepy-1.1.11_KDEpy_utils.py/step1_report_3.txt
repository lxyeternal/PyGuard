  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for Cartesian product generation and automatic grid creation for data analysis.",
  "sources": "Data inputs for functions: 'data' parameter in autogrid, arrays in cartesian.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into calculations for grid boundaries and cartesian products; no external or untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. Use of standard numerical and numpy functions with no suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two main functions: 'cartesian' for generating Cartesian products of arrays and 'autogrid' for creating data grids with boundary extensions. Both functions use numpy for numerical computations, with input validation and error handling. The code is well-structured, includes helpful comments and examples, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code patterns. The main block executes pytest for testing, which is standard. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, malicious payloads, or unsafe behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for numerical and data grid operations, with no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
