  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating cartesian products and automatic grid creation for data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters, including data.shape, data.min(), data.max(), and data arrays. No untrusted input sources are explicitly handled.",
  "sinks": "Returns numpy arrays; no data is sent over network, written to files, or used in system commands. No external sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations in cartesian and autogrid functions, resulting in output numpy arrays. No untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code includes standard data manipulation functions with no signs of obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script provides utility functions for computing cartesian products of arrays and generating grids based on data ranges, with parameter validation and boundary adjustments. No external data sources or sinks, no network, system, or privacy-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and uses standard libraries only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for data processing with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs standard computations with proper parameter validation and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
