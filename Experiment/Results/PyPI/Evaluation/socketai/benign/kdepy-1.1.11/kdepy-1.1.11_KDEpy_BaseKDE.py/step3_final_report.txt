  "purpose": "Abstract base class for kernel density estimators, handling parameter validation, data processing, and evaluation scaffolding.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters (kernel, bw), data input in fit(), grid points in evaluate()",
  "sinks": "None detected; no external data leaks or untrusted data sinks",
  "flows": "Parameters validated and assigned during __init__, data processed in fit(), evaluation performed in evaluate() with grid points and bandwidth",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard validation and data handling; import of pytest in main block is benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured abstract class for KDE, performing input validation, data reshaping, and evaluation setup. No network calls, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The only external activity is the import of pytest for testing, which is typical. The code relies on external libraries (KDEpy, numpy) that are common for such tasks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's logic is straightforward, focusing on parameter validation, data processing, and evaluation scaffolding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an abstract KDE class with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the benign nature of the code and the absence of external system interactions. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and the security risk score should be very low (~0.0 to 0.1). The existing reports are accurate; the high risk score in one report (0.9) is unjustified and should be lowered to reflect the benign nature.",
