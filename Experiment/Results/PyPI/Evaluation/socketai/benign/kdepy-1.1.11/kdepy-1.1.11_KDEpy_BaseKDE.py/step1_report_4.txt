{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for Kernel Density Estimators, facilitating common setup, validation, and evaluation procedures.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data input sources; data inputs occur in the fit() and evaluate() methods, which process data sequences and arrays.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily processes data internally; no apparent output sinks involve external systems or untrusted data channels. The only output is via evaluation methods returning processed data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sequences to internal numpy arrays during fit() via _process_sequence(). The evaluate() method uses stored data and bandwidths to compute density estimates, returning results. No external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No use of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names. Validation logic is standard. No malware signatures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard abstract base class for KDE with input validation, data processing, and evaluation routines. All data handling appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious behavior. The only notable operations involve data conversion and validation. The final main block invokes pytest for testing, which is common and benign. No external system calls, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of an abstract KDE base class with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs data validation, processing, and mathematical computations related to kernel density estimation.",
