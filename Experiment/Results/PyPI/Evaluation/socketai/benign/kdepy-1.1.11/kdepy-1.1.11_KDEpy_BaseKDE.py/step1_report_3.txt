{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for kernel density estimators, facilitating the implementation and evaluation of different KDE models.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'kernel', 'bw', 'data', 'weights', and 'grid_points'; class attributes and method arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow from input parameters to internal attributes; no evident direct data leaks or malicious sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and stored in class attributes; data flows from 'fit' inputs through processing methods to evaluation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code relies on standard libraries and well-known third-party packages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of an abstract base class for KDE with input validation, data processing, and evaluation scaffolding. It includes safety checks such as assertions and input validation. There are no indications of malicious functions, network operations, or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is the import of pytest within the main block, but this is standard for testing and not malicious. No hidden or malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an abstract KDE class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be safe and appropriate for open-source distribution.",
