{
  "purpose": "This module defines an abstract base class for kernel density estimation, including methods for initialization, fitting data, and evaluating the density estimate.",
  "sources": "Reads input data in 'fit' method (data, weights), kernel and bandwidth parameters during initialization, and grid points during evaluation.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if 'evaluate' or 'fit' methods are misused, but no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input data and weights flow from user to internal processed variables during 'fit'; grid points are generated or processed during 'evaluate'; data flows from sources to sinks in validation and processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No suspicious network activity, file operations, or obfuscated code present. The code is structured as an abstract class with no executable malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of an abstract base class for kernel density estimators. It performs parameter validation, data processing, and method setup without any indications of malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscated patterns are present. The only noteworthy aspect is its reliance on external modules ('KDEpy') and standard validation procedures, which are typical for such implementations. There are no apparent security risks or malware indicators. The code functions purely for statistical estimation purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of an abstract kernel density estimation class with no malicious intent. It contains no suspicious or malicious patterns, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
