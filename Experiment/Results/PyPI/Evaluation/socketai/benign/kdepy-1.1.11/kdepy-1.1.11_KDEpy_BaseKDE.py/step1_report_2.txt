{
  "purpose": "The code defines an abstract base class for kernel density estimators, including methods for initialization, fitting data, and evaluation. It facilitates creation of subclasses implementing specific KDE algorithms.",
  "sources": "Input data in fit() via 'data' and 'weights'; 'kernel' and 'bw' parameters during initialization; grid points in evaluate().",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted grid_points in evaluate() can influence computations; however, no code directly writes to external systems or leaks data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from fit() input to self.data and self.weights; 'grid_points' from evaluate() input; 'bw' parameters from init to evaluate() if used; no external data transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior; standard use of numpy, class inheritance, and method validation. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for kernel density estimators, implementing input validation, data processing, and evaluation logic. It uses standard libraries and common design patterns for such models. All data handling appears to be internal, with no indications of malicious data exfiltration, system compromise, or sabotage. The code's structure is clear and adheres to typical mathematical and statistical processing routines without any suspicious or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a kernel density estimation base class without malicious intent. It performs data validation, supports flexible input, and does not contain any evident malware or security risks.",
