{
  "purpose": "The code defines an abstract base class for kernel density estimators, handling initialization, data processing, and evaluation procedures.",
  "sources": "Input data to fit() and evaluate() methods; kernel and bandwidth parameters; optional grid_points in evaluate().",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is directed for malicious purposes; no network, file, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from fit() and evaluate() methods into internal data structures; kernel and bandwidth parameters influence computations but do not lead to external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of external libraries appears legitimate. The code includes standard validation and processing without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured abstract class for kernel density estimators. It performs input validation, data processing, and evaluation setup without any malicious logic. No network, file, or system manipulation is present. No code injection, data leakage, or covert channels are apparent. All operations are standard for a statistical estimator class, with clear parameter handling and input validation. No anomalies or signs of sabotage are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a base class for kernel density estimators, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors.",
