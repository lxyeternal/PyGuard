{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for bandwidth selection in kernel density estimation, including methods like Sheather-Jones, Scott's rule, and Silverman's rule.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as 'data' and 'weights'; data shape and values are accessed throughout the functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data or interacts with external systems; no direct sinks related to data leakage or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions where statistical computations are performed; no external network or system command calls are made.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code performs standard numerical computations without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements established bandwidth selection algorithms for KDE, utilizing numpy and scipy for mathematical operations. Root finding is performed with brentq, which is a standard method. The code handles data normalization, FFT-based density estimation, and includes warnings for potentially problematic inputs such as constant data. No code executes external commands, network calls, or manipulates system resources in suspicious ways. All functions perform statistical calculations typical for density estimation parameter selection.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this code. It appears to be a legitimate implementation of bandwidth selection algorithms used in KDE. No data leaks or harmful actions are evident.",
