  "purpose": "The code provides functions for bandwidth selection in kernel density estimation, including methods like Sheather-Jones, Scott's rule, and Silverman's rule.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as 'data', 'weights', and internally from data transformations like FFT and DCT computations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calculations involving data transformations, root finding, and bandwidth outputs; no evident sink leads to data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into binning, FFT/DCT transforms, fixed point calculations, and root-finding functions. The bandwidth functions process data internally to produce a numerical bandwidth value.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code uses standard scientific libraries with no obfuscated or suspicious features. Warnings about ignoring weights are benign. No system commands, network operations, or data exfiltration are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical and numerical methods for bandwidth selection in KDE, utilizing numpy, scipy, and KDEpy. The functions incorporate mathematical procedures like DCT, FFT, fixed-point iteration, and root-finding algorithms that are well-documented and typical for such tasks. No parts of the code indicate malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or hidden backdoors. The code's structure is straightforward, and external communication or file operations are absent. The warnings about ignoring weights are benign and common in such implementations. Overall, the code appears to serve its legitimate purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of bandwidth selection algorithms for KDE with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It contains no network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Its functions are typical of scientific computation and statistical estimation routines.",
