{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for bandwidth selection in kernel density estimation, including methods like Sheather-Jones, Scott's rule, and Silverman's rule.",
  "sources": "Reads data inputs for density estimation, data shape and statistical calculations, as well as optional weights.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits data to external systems; no apparent data leaks or external data transmission points.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input parameters, processed through mathematical/statistical functions, and outputs are returned as bandwidth estimates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code performs standard statistical computations. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables are present. Warnings are issued for ignored weights or constant data, which are normal in statistical routines.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard bandwidth selection algorithms for KDE, with proper numerical methods and error handling. No code segments indicate malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor functionalities. The root-finding and fixed point computations are consistent with statistical algorithms. The warning about ignored weights is standard and not suspicious. No external data transmission or code injection mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of bandwidth selection rules for density estimation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The routines follow expected statistical procedures and handle edge cases appropriately.",
