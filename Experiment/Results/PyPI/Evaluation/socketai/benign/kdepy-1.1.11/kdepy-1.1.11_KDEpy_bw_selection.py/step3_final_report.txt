{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for bandwidth selection in kernel density estimation, implementing standard statistical algorithms such as Sheather-Jones, Scott's rule, and Silverman's rule.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include raw data arrays, optional weights, and internal computations read from these sources; no external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "The code performs internal calculations only; there are no external data transmissions, network communications, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through statistical transformations, FFT/DCT computations, root-finding procedures, and bandwidth calculations, all within the local environment without external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution. Warnings about ignoring weights are standard in statistical routines.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-established statistical routines for bandwidth selection in KDE, utilizing numpy and scipy libraries for numerical operations such as FFT, DCT, root-finding, and fixed-point iterations. It includes proper error handling, comments, and standard algorithms. No external communication, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. Warnings about ignoring weights are typical and benign. The functions are designed for local computation only, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of bandwidth selection algorithms for KDE. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The code is safe for use in production environments.",
