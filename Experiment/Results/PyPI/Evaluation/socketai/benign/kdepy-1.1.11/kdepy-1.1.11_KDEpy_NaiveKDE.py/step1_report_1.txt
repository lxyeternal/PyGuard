  "purpose": "Implementation of a Naive Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) class for density estimation tasks, providing flexibility in kernel choice, bandwidth, and evaluation methods.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (itertools, numbers, numpy) and a local module (KDEpy.BaseKDE). No external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the code primarily performs mathematical computations and method calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (via fit method) flows into data validation and storage; evaluation reads data and grid points; kernel calculations process data points for density estimates. No untrusted data flows into unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code appears straightforward, with standard kernel density estimation implementation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for KDE using a naive approach, extending a base class, with methods for fitting data and evaluating the density. The implementation involves standard numpy operations, kernel calculations, and optional bandwidth handling. No external data sources, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only notable aspect is the use of 'super()' for method calls and itertools for default weights. The code structure and logic follow typical KDE implementations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard KDE class without any malicious behaviors or suspicious code. It contains no network operations, data leaks, or hardcoded secrets. The structure and logic are consistent with open-source scientific Python code. Confidence is high that it is benign.",
