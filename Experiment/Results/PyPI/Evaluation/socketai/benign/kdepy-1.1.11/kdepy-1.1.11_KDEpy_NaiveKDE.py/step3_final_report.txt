  "purpose": "Implementation of a naive kernel density estimator for data analysis, allowing customization of kernel functions, bandwidth, and norms.",
  "sources": "Data points from the 'fit' method; optional grid points for evaluation.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network operations; computations are internal and self-contained.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data to the evaluation method, passing through kernel computations and weights, with no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The inclusion of pytest in the main block is standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a KDE class, inheriting from a base class, performing standard data fitting and evaluation. It uses common libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or obfuscation. The only notable aspect is the presence of a pytest call, which is typical for testing and not malicious. No external or untrusted data sources are involved, and the code does not perform any network operations or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a standard scientific utility for kernel density estimation with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
