  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the KDEpy package with Cython extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, importing Cython and setuptools modules, retrieving include directories from numpy.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the script only handles build configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup for Cython extension compilation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for building Cython extensions, specifies the package name, include directories, and extension modules. It uses numpy's get_include() to specify include paths for compiling Cython code. The setup function is standard for building a Python package with Cython extensions. There are no indications of code obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious code patterns. It solely focuses on package configuration and compilation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for compiling Cython extensions in the KDEpy package. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
