{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to install and build the 'KDEpy' Python package, specifically compiling Cython extensions for performance optimization.",
  "sources": "The code imports system build tools, numpy for include directories, and uses setup() to process package installation; it does not read external untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "The setup process compiles extension modules, but no untrusted data or external inputs are involved in the installation process that could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A – The code executes installation steps without data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears standard for building Cython extensions, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual logic, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses established build tools (setuptools, Cython) to compile extension modules. It specifies the source files for compilation and includes necessary directories. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior. The code adheres to standard practices for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for compiling Cython extensions as part of a Python package. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
