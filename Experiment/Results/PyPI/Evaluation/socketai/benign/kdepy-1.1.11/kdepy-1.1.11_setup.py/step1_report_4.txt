  "purpose": "Installer script for the KDEpy package using setuptools and Cython.",
  "sources": "Import statements, numpy.get_include(), cythonize, and extension module definitions.",
  "sinks": "setup() function execution, extension compilation process.",
  "flows": "No external or untrusted data flow is present; flow is from code definitions to setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is a straightforward build script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for building a Cython extension, including numpy and setuptools. It defines a setup configuration to compile a Cython module 'KDEpy._cutils' from 'KDEpy/cutils_ext/cutils.pyx'. The code appears standard for a package build process, with no indication of malicious activity. It does not execute untrusted input, connect to networks, or handle sensitive data. The structure and content are typical of a Python extension build script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build script for compiling a Cython extension in a Python package. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a legitimate part of the package installation process.",
