{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to build and install the KDEpy package, including compiling Cython extensions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it primarily accesses package source files and NumPy include directories.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into potential security issues; the code compiles extensions but does not execute or transfer data externally.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the build process compiles Cython extensions from local source files.",
  "anomalies": "The script uses standard setup procedures; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary build tools and dependencies, sets up the package configuration with Cython extension compilation, and uses NumPy's include directories. It follows standard build practices without unusual or malicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical build script for a Python package with Cython extensions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
