  "purpose": "Build configuration script for compiling Cython extension modules for the KDEpy package.",
  "sources": "Imports from Cython.Build, numpy, Cython.Distutils, and setuptools; reads no external input or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks, network activity, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script only sets up build parameters without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard import and setup calls, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that uses setuptools and Cython to compile extension modules. It dynamically retrieves include directories from numpy and defines a single extension module. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence=1. The code does not handle untrusted input, connect externally, or execute suspicious logic. The scores are consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign build script for a Python package extension. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
