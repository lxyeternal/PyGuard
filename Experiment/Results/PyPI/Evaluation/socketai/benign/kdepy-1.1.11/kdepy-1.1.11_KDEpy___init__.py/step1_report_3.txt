{
  "purpose": "The code imports and exposes specific classes from the KDEpy package for KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) computations, and retrieves the package version information.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('KDEpy')",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or malicious activities are present.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is retrieving the package version, which is a standard operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code is straightforward, primarily involving imports and metadata retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The script imports metadata retrieval tools and specific classes from KDEpy, a legitimate Python package, then assigns version and author information. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to serve as a module initialization or setup file, with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily handling imports and package metadata retrieval. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
