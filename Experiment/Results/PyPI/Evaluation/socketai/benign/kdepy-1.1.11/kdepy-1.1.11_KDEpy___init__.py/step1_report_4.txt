{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific modules from the KDEpy library and sets package metadata, likely for a Python package that provides kernel density estimation functionalities.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('KDEpy') retrieves version info from installed package; imports from KDEpy library modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is being sent, written, or executed from untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Retrieval of package version flows from system metadata; import statements load modules without executing untrusted code",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward import and metadata access",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific modules and accesses package metadata; no input handling, data processing, or network activity occurs. The use of importlib.metadata.version suggests it reads package info, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package metadata and module import script with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
