{
  "purpose": "The code sets up imports for KDEpy modules and retrieves package version information, likely to be used in a larger data analysis or visualization script.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(\"KDEpy\") retrieves the package version; imports from KDEpy modules for KDE implementations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data is sent externally or written in a suspicious manner.",
  "flows": "Version info is obtained from the package metadata; imported modules are used for data processing within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs straightforward imports and metadata access.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific modules from KDEpy, retrieves the package version metadata, and defines an author and export list. All actions are standard for a Python package or module setup. No signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious data flows are present. The code appears to be part of a larger project that utilizes KDEpy for kernel density estimation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard import and metadata retrieval functions with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
