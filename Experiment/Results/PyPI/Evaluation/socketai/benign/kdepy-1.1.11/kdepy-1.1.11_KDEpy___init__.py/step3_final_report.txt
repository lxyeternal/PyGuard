  "purpose": "Module initialization and metadata setup for the KDEpy package, importing specific classes and retrieving version info.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('KDEpy') for version retrieval; imports of KDEpy classes (FFTKDE, NaiveKDE, TreeKDE).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Retrieving package version from importlib.metadata.version and importing classes; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward imports and metadata assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, retrieving version info, and defining metadata variables. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initialization script with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
