{
  "purpose": "The code sets up module metadata and imports specific classes from the KDEpy package for further use.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata for retrieving package version, imports of KDEpy classes (FFTKDE, NaiveKDE, TreeKDE)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Retrieval of package version flows from package metadata, import statements do not process external or untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic; straightforward package import and metadata retrieval",
  "analysis": "The script imports metadata and specific classes from KDEpy, defines module version and author info, and exports the classes. There is no user input processing, network activity, or code execution based on external untrusted data. The only notable action is reading package metadata, which is benign. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard setup and import operations for a Python module, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
