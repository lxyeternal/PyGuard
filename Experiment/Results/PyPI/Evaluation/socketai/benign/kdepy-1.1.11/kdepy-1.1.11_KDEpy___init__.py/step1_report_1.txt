{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific modules from the KDEpy package and retrieves its version information, likely for a Python package setup or initialization.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('KDEpy')",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The version string retrieved by importlib.metadata.version flows from the source to the __version__ variable, but this is a benign operation with no malicious impact.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or unusual language features. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports metadata information from the package 'KDEpy' and specific classes from its modules. It sets module metadata (__version__, __author__) and defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be standard package initialization or metadata setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply imports modules and retrieves version info for the KDEpy package.",
