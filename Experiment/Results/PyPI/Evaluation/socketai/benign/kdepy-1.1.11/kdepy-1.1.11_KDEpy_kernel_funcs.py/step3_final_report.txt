{
  "purpose": "The code defines various kernel functions and a Kernel class for density estimation and related statistical computations, providing normalized functions with support for evaluation and support estimation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read through the evaluate method, which accepts arrays or numbers, and the brentq root-finding function internally uses the class method for support estimation.",
  "sinks": "The code performs internal computations only; no external data leaks, network activity, or exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the evaluate method, where it is scaled and passed to the kernel functions; support estimation uses brentq to find the support boundary based on the kernel's evaluate method.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. Use of standard libraries and numerical methods is appropriate and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of kernel functions for statistical purposes, with proper normalization, support calculation, and evaluation methods. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of scipy's brentq for support estimation is standard practice. Input handling includes safe conversions, and the functions rely solely on mathematical computations. The overall design aligns with common scientific computing patterns, and the code is readable and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, mathematically sound implementation of kernel functions for density estimation, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
