{
  "purpose": "Define various kernel functions for use in statistical and machine learning models, with support for different norms, integrals, and scaling options.",
  "sources": "Input data `x` in the `evaluate` method of the Kernel class, function parameters like `bw`, `x`, and internal helper functions.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation of kernel functions on input data, which could potentially lead to information leaks if used maliciously. No explicit data exfiltration or network communication is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input `x` and `bw` parameters through `evaluate` to compute kernel values; no external or untrusted data sources are used beyond input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or code injection. The code is well-structured, mathematical, and intended for statistical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mathematical kernel functions, norms, integrals, and a Kernel class for evaluation. It includes standard mathematical functions with proper normalization and support for finite and infinite support. No network operations, file I/O, or external command execution are present. All input data is processed locally; no data exfiltration mechanisms or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate mathematical library for kernel functions, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a legitimate implementation of kernel functions and associated mathematical utilities. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is well-structured, with standard mathematical operations, and does not perform any network communication, data theft, or other malicious actions. Security risks are minimal, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
