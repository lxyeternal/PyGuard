{
  "purpose": "This module defines various kernel functions for use in statistical or machine learning applications, particularly kernel density estimation. It provides implementations of common kernels such as Gaussian, Epanechnikov, Triangular, and others, along with utility functions for norms and integrals.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data primarily from function parameters, especially from the 'x' input in the evaluate method of Kernel class, and the 'bw' (bandwidth) parameter. No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include the evaluate method which processes input data and computes kernel values. No untrusted data is written to files, network, or environment variables within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (x, bw) into the evaluate method, which processes and applies the kernel function. There are no external data flows to other systems or network locations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or hard-coded secrets are present. The code appears to implement standard mathematical functions and kernel evaluations. The use of 'pytest' for testing is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mathematical utility functions for integrals, norms, and volume calculations, as well as several kernel functions with proper normalization. The Kernel class encapsulates kernel behavior with support for finite/infinite support and a method for practical support calculations. No external data access, network operations, or insecure code practices are evident. The only external module calls are to scipy and numpy, which are standard scientific libraries. The __main__ block runs tests via pytest, which is safe. Overall, the code performs standard kernel computations without malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of various kernel functions and related utilities, intended for use in statistical modeling or kernel density estimation. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious code are present. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
