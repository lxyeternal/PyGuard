{
  "purpose": "The code defines various kernel functions for use in statistical or machine learning models, such as Gaussian, Epanechnikov, and others, encapsulated within a Kernel class for flexible evaluation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read via the evaluate method, which accepts x as array-like input; support values and parameters are also set internally or externally.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation outputs kernel density values; no evidence of data leaks or malicious data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input x → evaluate method → kernel function → output density values; optional support calculation involves brentq root finding for support limits.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The use of mathematical functions and root finding appears standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily implements kernel density functions and their integrals, with proper scaling, normalization, and support calculations. The Kernel class provides a structured way to evaluate these functions with flexible bandwidth and support options. External libraries are used for mathematical operations; no dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity is present. The code is well-structured, and the functions are mathematically sound. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or privacy violations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of kernel functions with a wrapper class for evaluation, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be part of a scientific or statistical library, focused on mathematical computations.",
