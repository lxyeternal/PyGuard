{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for linear binning of data points onto a grid, primarily for data preprocessing in kernel density estimation or related algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays, grid point arrays, and optional weight arrays; converts them to numpy arrays; reads data shape and statistical properties for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Performs in-memory calculations; no direct data leaks or network communications observed; no sensitive data is transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Data and weights are validated and converted; data is transformed into grid coordinates; binning functions compute weighted sums that are stored locally; no external data flow or output beyond return values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard numerical processing and includes an import of a compiled Cython extension without suspicious functionality. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements multiple binning functions, both in pure Python, NumPy vectorized, and Cython for efficiency, to assign data points to a grid with associated weights. The functions handle multidimensional data, scale inputs, and calculate binned weights. All operations appear to be standard for data processing; no network, file I/O, or external command execution is present. The import of '_cutils' from 'KDEpy' may suggest compiled extensions, but nothing suspicious is evident in their usage. The final section invokes pytest for testing, which is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate numerical data processing module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on standard libraries and compiled extensions for performance. There are no indicators of malware, data theft, backdoors, or malicious network activity.",
