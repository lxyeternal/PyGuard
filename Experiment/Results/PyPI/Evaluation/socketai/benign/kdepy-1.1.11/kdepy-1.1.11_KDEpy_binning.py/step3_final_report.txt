{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for linear binning of weighted data, used in statistical preprocessing and kernel density estimation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays, grid points, and optional weights; transforms data for binning calculations.",
  "sinks": "Outputs binned data array; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data is validated, transformed, and passed through optimized routines (_cutils) for binning; no external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; reliance on external compiled module is standard for performance.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numerical binning with input validation, numpy operations, and external Cython-accelerated routines. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The external module _cutils is used for performance but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is well-structured, documented, and typical for high-performance data processing modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of linear binning routines with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The scores should reflect zero malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk.",
