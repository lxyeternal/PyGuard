The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the benign nature of the code and the absence of external system interactions. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and the security risk score should be very low (~0.0 to 0.1). The existing reports are accurate; the high risk score in one report (0.9) is unjustified and should be lowered to reflect the benign nature."
