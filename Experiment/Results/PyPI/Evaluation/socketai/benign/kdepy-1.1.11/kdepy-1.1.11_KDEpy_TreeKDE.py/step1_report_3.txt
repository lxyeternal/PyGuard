  "purpose": "Implement a tree-based kernel density estimation (KDE) using scipy's cKDTree for efficient neighbor searches.",
  "sources": "Reads data input during fit() and evaluate() methods; reads grid points for evaluation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs evaluated density estimates; does not appear to write untrusted data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data is input via fit(), processed with tree queries in evaluate(), and results are returned; no external data sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code appears to be a standard implementation of KDE with spatial tree queries. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for kernel density estimation using a k-d tree for spatial queries, which is standard practice in KDE implementations. The fit() method stores data and optional weights; evaluate() computes density estimates on specified grids. The use of scipy's cKDTree and numpy for numerical operations are typical. No external data is read or written in a suspicious manner. The methods and parameters align with normal KDE procedures. No malicious or sabotage code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a tree-based KDE for numerical data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious data leakage. The structure and usage are typical for scientific computing libraries. Overall security risk is minimal.",
