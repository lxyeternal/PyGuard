{
  "purpose": "Implements a tree-based kernel density estimation using scipy's cKDTree for efficient neighbor queries and density evaluation.",
  "sources": "Input data points, weights, grid points, kernel parameters, epsilon parameter for support approximation.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data exfiltration; computations are internal and standard for statistical estimation.",
  "flows": "Data is fitted via 'fit', then evaluated on a grid through 'evaluate', querying neighbors and computing kernel estimates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a transparent, standard implementation of a KDE estimator leveraging scipy's spatial KDTree. It handles untrusted inputs in a typical manner for scientific libraries but does not execute external code or perform network operations. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-documented implementation of a tree-based KDE with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and there is no evidence of supply chain threats or malicious sabotage.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
