  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the Automator framework, specifically testing properties and protocols of the AMWorkflowController class.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Automator and TestSupport modules; method decorators for minimum OS and SDK levels.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code primarily performs assertions and does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks detected; the code runs assertions on existing framework methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system frameworks and defines unit tests for OS-specific properties and protocols. It uses standard testing practices and API calls to check framework capabilities. No data inputs, network activities, or system modifications are present. The code appears purely for validation of framework features without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for system framework components, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
