  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes build setup, test routines, environment detection via system commands, and SDK info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess to invoke system commands (`sw_vers`, `clang`, `xcrun`) to gather system info; modifies sys.path and sys.modules for testing.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no obfuscation. Subprocess calls are standard for system info collection.\n- **Analysis:** All activities are typical for a build system on macOS. No suspicious network activity or malicious code detected. The subprocess commands are used for environment info, not malicious purposes.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate build and test script. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: very low (0.1).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, focusing on SDK detection, build configuration, environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess for system info, modifies sys.path, loads modules dynamically.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard system commands; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard build script activities. No signs of malicious activity. The subprocess calls are for environment detection.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, malicious intent, or suspicious behavior. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Setup for building/testing, gathers SDK info, modifies environment.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess for system info, reads SDK plist files, modifies sys.path/modules.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Analysis:** Typical for build scripts on macOS. Subprocess calls are for environment info. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard build script. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build, test, install setup for PyObjC, uses environment variables, subprocesses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes system commands (`sw_vers`, `clang`, `xcrun`), reads/writes files, modifies sys.path/modules.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, subprocess calls are standard.\n- **Analysis:** Activities are typical for a macOS build environment. No malicious payloads or network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others—setup for building/testing, environment detection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess for system info, modifies environment, loads modules.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, subprocess calls are standard.\n- **Analysis:** Routine build configuration, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports indicate no malicious activity (score 0).\n- **Obfuscated:** All are straightforward, no obfuscation detected (score 0).\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting typical build scripts (0.1–0.2).\n\n**Overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** ~0.2 (consistent with the reports' assessments)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard build and setup script for macOS-based Python packages, performing environment detection, SDK management, and testing routines. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and my detailed analysis.",
