  "purpose": "Build, test, and package routines for the PyObjC framework, including environment detection and SDK info collection.",
  "sources": "System commands via subprocess (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), environment variables, filesystem reads (SDK plist, egg info).",
  "sinks": "Modifications to sys.path and sys.modules, file writes for build info, subprocess execution for environment info.",
  "flows": "System commands and environment variables influence build configuration and SDK detection; data flows into build info files and environment setup.",
  "anomalies": "Standard subprocess calls for environment info; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup and build tasks on macOS, invoking system utilities for environment detection, configuring build flags, and managing test environments. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; subprocess calls are used for legitimate system info retrieval, and environment modifications are routine for build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, legitimate build and test setup for PyObjC on macOS. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present. The low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the nature of the code.",
