  "purpose": "This script provides setup and build configuration for the PyObjC framework wrappers, including custom build commands, environment setup, and testing routines.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, subprocess command outputs, files on disk (e.g., SDKSettings.plist, PKG-INFO, header files), and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include subprocess calls executing external commands, file operations (reading SDK info, plist files, writing build info), and dynamic code imports for testing.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from environment variables and files flows into subprocess commands (e.g., 'sw_vers', 'clang', 'xcrun'), which can influence command execution. Data from files (e.g., SDKSettings.plist, PKG-INFO) influence build configurations. Import statements and test suite loading rely on dynamically generated module names from file paths.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The subprocess commands appear standard for environment detection. Dynamic import of test modules based on file patterns could be exploited if malicious files are introduced into the test directory structure. No code injection, or obscure obfuscated code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection (OS, SDK versions), configures compiler flags, and runs tests through standard subprocess and file operations. All subprocess calls are to trusted system utilities or reading known plist files. Dynamic imports are limited to test files matching specific patterns, which is typical for test suites. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are identified. The use of subprocess and file I/O is typical for build scripts and appears safe. No use of eval, exec, or other dynamic code execution that could be malicious. The code is well-structured with no anomalies suggesting malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup and build configuration script for a Python extension package. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. The subprocess calls and file operations are used for environment detection and build configuration, which is typical for such scripts. There are no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
