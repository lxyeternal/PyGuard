  "purpose": "A unit test verifying that Automator.AMShellScriptAction.remapLineEndings returns a boolean value.",
  "sources": "The test calls the method Automator.AMShellScriptAction.remapLineEndings without processing external input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The test directly asserts the return type of the method; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Automator framework and testing support, then defines a simple test case asserting the return type of a method. All reports agree that this is a benign, straightforward unit test with no malicious intent, data leaks, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior. No external data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The code aligns with standard testing practices for macOS automation frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test verifying a method return type in the Automator framework. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
