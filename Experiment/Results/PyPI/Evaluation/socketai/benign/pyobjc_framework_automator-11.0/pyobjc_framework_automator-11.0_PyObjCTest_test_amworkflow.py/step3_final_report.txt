  "purpose": "This code is a unit test suite verifying method signatures and OS compatibility for the Automator.AMWorkflow class, with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Method calls to Automator.AMWorkflow (runWorkflowAtURL_withInput_error_, initWithContentsOfURL_error_, writeToURL_error_, setValue_forVariableWithName_).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or output data beyond assertions.",
  "flows": "Method signature assertions verify argument and return types; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test class that checks method signatures and OS version compatibility for Automator workflows. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or system modifications. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's purpose is purely for validation of API signatures, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
