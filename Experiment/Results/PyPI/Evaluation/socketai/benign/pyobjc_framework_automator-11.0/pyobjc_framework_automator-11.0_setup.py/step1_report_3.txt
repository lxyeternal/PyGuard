{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package for wrapping the macOS Automator framework using PyObjC, primarily for development and integration purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory for module dependencies; reads environment variables indirectly via os.path and sys.path modifications.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, defining setup configuration, and preparing extensions without passing untrusted data to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. The code follows standard packaging procedures with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools-like syntax, importing modules, defining extensions, and configuring dependencies. It uses 'os' and 'sys' for environment and path handling, which are common in setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or unusual code patterns are present. The use of 'pyobjc_setup' and extensions for building a macOS framework wrapper is legitimate and aligns with typical Python C extension packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package wrapping a macOS framework. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The script's structure and content are consistent with standard package distribution practices.",
