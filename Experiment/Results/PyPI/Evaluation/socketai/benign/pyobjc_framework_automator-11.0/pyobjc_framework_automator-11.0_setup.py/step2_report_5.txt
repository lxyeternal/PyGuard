  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the security assessments are accurate, and then synthesize an overall risk evaluation.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior. It reads module files from the current directory, uses standard setup tools, and does not process untrusted input.  \n- **Assessment:** The conclusion of zero malware and security risk aligns with the code. The confidence is high (1).  \n- **Verdict:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** The script dynamically constructs dependency lists from the filesystem, which could be manipulated if the 'Modules' directory is compromised. However, this is standard practice in setup scripts. No malicious activity is indicated.  \n- **Analysis:** No external data fetching, no network activity, no suspicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** The security risk is rated at 0.1, which seems reasonable given the filesystem dependence but no actual malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, which is correct.  \n- **Verdict:** No malicious activity; the low security risk is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to others, standard package setup code, no untrusted data handling, no network activity, no suspicious constructs.  \n- **Assessment:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1, which is appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues; the assessment appears accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Standard setup script, no untrusted data or malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Malware and security risk scores are 0, consistent with the code.  \n- **Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard packaging code, no malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward, not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given that all reports agree and the code is a standard setup script with no external data handling or suspicious activity, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and standard)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script for wrapping a macOS framework, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No changes needed in the scores.  \n- The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
