{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package that provides wrappers for the macOS Automator framework, facilitating the development and execution of Automator actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory to list module files (os.listdir), and uses __file__ to determine the module path.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; the script only configures package installation.",
  "flows": "The filesystem operations (os.listdir) provide module dependencies; no external data or network flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The dynamic inclusion of modules based on filesystem contents could be manipulated if the 'Modules' directory is compromised, but this is standard in setup scripts and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: defining package metadata, dynamically listing module dependencies from the 'Modules' directory, and specifying build parameters. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code. The filesystem dependency is typical for setup scripts but could be exploited if the directory is compromised; however, this does not constitute malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward setup script for a Python package wrapping a macOS framework. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The minor filesystem dependency does not pose a security threat in this context.",
