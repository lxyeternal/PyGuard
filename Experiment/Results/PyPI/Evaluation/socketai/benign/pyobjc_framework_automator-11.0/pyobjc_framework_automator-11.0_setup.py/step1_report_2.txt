However, this is standard practice in setup scripts and does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The script primarily sets up package metadata and compiles extension modules using standard Python packaging practices. It dynamically reads module files from the filesystem to include as dependencies, which is typical for extension building. No external data is fetched or processed in an insecure manner. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a PyObjC wrapper package.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a standard package setup script for a Python extension module, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.
