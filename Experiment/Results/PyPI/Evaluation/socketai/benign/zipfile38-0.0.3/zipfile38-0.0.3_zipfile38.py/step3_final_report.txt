  "purpose": "Provides comprehensive ZIP archive handling including reading, writing, compression, encryption, and filesystem-like interface.",
  "sources": "File input/output, user input for filenames, password handling for encrypted files",
  "sinks": "Writing ZIP headers, compressed/encrypted data, extracting files to filesystem",
  "flows": "Data from files or user input -> compression/encryption -> ZIP archive structures or filesystem during extraction",
  "anomalies": "Comment about 'utf-8' references needing further investigation; no malicious code or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ZIP functionalities: reading, writing, ZIP64 support, encryption routines, and path-like interface. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. Cryptographic routines follow typical ZIP password encryption, which is weak but standard. The 'utf-8' comment appears to be a placeholder for further review, not malicious. No network activity or hardcoded secrets are found. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's features and lack of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard ZIP utility library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The cryptographic routines are typical but weak, which is a known ZIP limitation, not an indicator of malicious intent. The comments about 'utf-8' are benign. Overall, the security risk is low, and the scores are justified.",
