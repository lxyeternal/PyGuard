  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard ZIP utility library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The cryptographic routines are typical but weak, which is a known ZIP limitation, not an indicator of malicious intent. The comments about 'utf-8' are benign. Overall, the security risk is low, and the scores are justified."
