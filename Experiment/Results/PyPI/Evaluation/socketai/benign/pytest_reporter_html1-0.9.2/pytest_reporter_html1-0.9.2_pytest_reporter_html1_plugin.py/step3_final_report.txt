  "purpose": "A pytest plugin designed to generate HTML reports with embedded or linked assets, utilizing templates, CSS, and styling features.",
  "sources": "File system reads for templates, CSS, assets; data encoding via base64; asset hashing for filenames.",
  "sinks": "Rendering templates into HTML; writing CSS and asset files to disk; embedding data URLs in HTML.",
  "flows": "File reads → encoding/hashing → storing assets or embedding inline → template rendering → output HTML.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; standard library usage; no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code handles assets securely, uses standard practices for encoding and hashing, and renders templates safely. It does not perform external communications, code execution, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscation are present. The low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are justified given the benign operations. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0, consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured pytest plugin for report generation. It poses no malicious threat, contains no obfuscation, and has a very low security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
