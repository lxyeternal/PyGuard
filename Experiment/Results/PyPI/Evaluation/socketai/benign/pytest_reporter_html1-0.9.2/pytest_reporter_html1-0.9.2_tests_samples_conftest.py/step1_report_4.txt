{
  "purpose": "The code prepares various types of data, including files, base64-encoded content, HTML, text, URLs, JSON, and unknown formats, for use in testing with pytest, specifically attaching extras to test reports.",
  "sources": "Reading binary data from 'screenshot.png' file; data is used in multiple formats.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data is being written or transmitted outside the script.",
  "flows": "File data is read from disk and encoded; data is stored in dictionaries and attached to pytest reports during test execution.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of hardcoded file path ('screenshot.png') and embedding of base64-encoded data; no secrets or credentials present. No suspicious network activity or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads image data from a local file and creates various representations (raw, base64, HTML, text, URL, JSON) for testing purposes. The 'pytest' hook modifies test report behavior, attaching predefined 'extras'. No user input or external data sources are involved beyond static files. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscation is present. The data handling appears benign and intended solely for testing, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign test setup script for pytest, preparing different data formats for testing purposes. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
