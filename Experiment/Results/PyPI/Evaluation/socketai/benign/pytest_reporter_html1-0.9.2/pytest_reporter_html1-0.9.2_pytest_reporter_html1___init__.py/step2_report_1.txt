  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims against the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Uses `importlib.metadata.version()` to retrieve the installed version of `'pytest-reporter-html1'`.\n- Wraps this in a try-except block to handle the case where the package isn't installed, setting `__version__` to `'unknown'`.\n- Defines a static URL pointing to the package's PyPI page.\n- No external data transmission, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Issue presence in code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code's purpose is to retrieve package version info and assign a static URL.\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- No anomalies or malicious actions are present.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors are present.\n- The code is straightforward and correctly handles the exception case.\n- The package name `'pytest-reporter-html1'` appears unconventional but not malicious or suspicious.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence score of 1 is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since there's no malicious activity, no external communication, and the code is static and benign, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Malware score:**\n- Correctly set to 0 in all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are consistent with the code.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The package name `'pytest-reporter-html1'` might seem unusual but is not inherently malicious.\n- The code is a typical pattern for package version retrieval with error handling.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**The current scores are appropriate and justified.**  \n**No changes needed.**  \n**Overall, the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.**",
