{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'pytest-reporter-html1' package and define its PyPI URL for reference.",
  "sources": "The 'version' function from importlib.metadata, and the string literal for the URL.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not process untrusted data or output data externally.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to get the package version and, upon failure, sets a default value; the URL is static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The use of importlib.metadata to query package version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses importlib.metadata.version to obtain the version of a specified package. It handles exceptions gracefully, setting __version__ to 'unknown' if the package isn't installed. The URL is static and does not interact with external sources or execute untrusted code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leaks. The code's purpose is straightforward, related to package metadata retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard snippet for obtaining package version info with basic error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security risks.",
