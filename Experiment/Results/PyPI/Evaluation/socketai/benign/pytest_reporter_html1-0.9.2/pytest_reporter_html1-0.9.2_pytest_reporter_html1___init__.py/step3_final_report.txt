{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the installed version of the 'pytest-reporter-html1' package, handling the case where it is not installed, and define a static URL to its PyPI page.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() function call to get package version, exception handling for missing package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static URL is assigned directly, no external communication",
  "flows": "Source: version() call; Sink: assignment to __version__; Exception handling flow sets __version__ to 'unknown' if package not found",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library functions, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to retrieve the version of a specific package using importlib.metadata.version(). It handles exceptions to avoid crashing if the package isn't installed, setting __version__ to 'unknown'. It also defines a static URL. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The logic is simple, standard, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard package version retrieval with proper error handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
