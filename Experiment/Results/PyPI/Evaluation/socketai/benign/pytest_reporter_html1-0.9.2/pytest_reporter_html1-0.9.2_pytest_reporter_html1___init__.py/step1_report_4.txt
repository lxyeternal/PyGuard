{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the installed version of the 'pytest-reporter-html1' package and set a URL to its PyPI page.",
  "sources": "The 'version' function from 'importlib.metadata' and the string assignment for '__pypi_url__'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The 'version' function reads package metadata; the URL is a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward. The package name 'pytest-reporter-html1' appears unconventional but could be valid.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'version' from 'importlib.metadata' to get the version of a specific package. It handles exceptions gracefully by setting '__version__' to 'unknown' if the package is not installed. It also defines a static URL pointing to the package's PyPI page. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The use of standard library functions indicates normal operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple metadata retrieval script with no malicious intent or security risks. It only accesses package information and assigns a static URL, both benign actions.",
