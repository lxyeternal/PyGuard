  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: retrieving a package version via `importlib.metadata.version()` with exception handling, and defining a static URL.\n- The package name 'pytest-reporter-html1' appears consistent across reports.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data transmission.\n- The code is straightforward, standard, and uses well-known Python library functions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's issues:\n\n**Code correctness:**\n- The code functions as intended: attempts to retrieve the version; if not installed, sets `'unknown'`.\n- No errors, flaws, or issues are evident in the code logic or execution.\n- The static URL is benign and unrelated to any malicious activity.\n\n**Presence of issues:**\n- No issues are present in the code based on the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws in reports:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n- No flawed assumptions or reasoning are apparent.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n\n**Malware score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain malicious payloads.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Security risk score:**\n- All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Risk score:**\n- All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's harmlessness.\n\n**Suggestion:**\n- No score adjustments needed; all are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n\n- Since the code is simple, safe, and has no malicious intent, higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The package name 'pytest-reporter-html1' is somewhat unconventional but not suspicious or malicious.\n- The static URL is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard utility snippet.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- All scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and poses no security concerns.",
