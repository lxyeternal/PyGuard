{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the installed version of the 'pytest-reporter-html1' package and set a fallback value if not installed.",
  "sources": "The 'version' function from 'importlib.metadata' to get package version, the 'try' block to handle import errors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage, system modifications, or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input from 'version' function (source) is used to set '__version__'; exception handling manages fallback without external effect.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. URL is static and unrelated to any malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to fetch the version of a specific package. If the package is not installed, it assigns 'unknown'. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or external data transmission. The URL provided is a static link to PyPI, not an active network call. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple version check with proper error handling. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility snippet.",
