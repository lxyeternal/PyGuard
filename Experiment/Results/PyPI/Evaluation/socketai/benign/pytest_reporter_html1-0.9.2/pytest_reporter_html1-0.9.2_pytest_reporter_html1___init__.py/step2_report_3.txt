  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their validity, consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing `version` from `importlib.metadata`, attempting to retrieve the version of `'pytest-reporter-html1'`, and assigning a static URL to `__pypi_url__`.\n- The logic is straightforward, with proper exception handling for missing packages.\n- No untrusted data sinks, external network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The code is benign, serving as a utility to fetch package metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description. It performs a simple version retrieval with fallback, and the URL is static.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None observed; no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws. The exception handling is appropriate.\n- **Scores:**\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct)\n  - `malware`: 0 (correct)\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 (correct)\n\n### Critical evaluation of individual reports:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** All reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no issues.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (appropriate).\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports. The code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or below, since the code is a simple utility with no security risks.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code performs a benign, standard operation with proper error handling. No malicious or suspicious activity is present, and the static URL is harmless.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and consistent. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the overall security assessment should be that this code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and poses no security risk.",
