  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest test functions used for testing various functionalities and markers within a test suite.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code primarily defines test functions and applies markers. The only data handled is within the test parameters and record_property calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data leading to security issues; no data is written to external systems or files, nor is there code execution based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not process untrusted input or data flows from source to sink that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is standard test code using pytest conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines pytest test functions with parameterization and marker application. It records properties for test reporting purposes. All code is standard, well-structured, and makes no suspicious or malicious use of data or system resources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical pytest test suite with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security vulnerabilities.",
