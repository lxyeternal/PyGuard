{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of pytest test functions primarily aimed at testing marker functionalities, documentation, and property recording within pytest.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include string parameters for tests, request object for applying markers, and record_property for recording properties.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no output or data transfer points are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into test functions but are only used for assertions or property recording; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is standard pytest test definitions with no unusual or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest test suite with parameterized tests, marker applications, documentation string, and property recording. All functions serve testing purposes without any network, file system, or external process interactions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of pytest tests with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
