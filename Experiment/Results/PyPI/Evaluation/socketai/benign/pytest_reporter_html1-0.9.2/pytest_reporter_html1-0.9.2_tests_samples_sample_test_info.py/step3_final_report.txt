  "purpose": "A set of pytest test functions demonstrating parameterization, marker usage, documentation, and property recording with static data.",
  "sources": "Static test parameters, marker decorators, docstring, and property recordings within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or network interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A — all data are static and controlled; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest suite with static data, no external dependencies, and no dynamic execution. All signals indicate benign behavior. The code does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The existing reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores. The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments are accurate; minor score adjustments can be made for consistency.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
