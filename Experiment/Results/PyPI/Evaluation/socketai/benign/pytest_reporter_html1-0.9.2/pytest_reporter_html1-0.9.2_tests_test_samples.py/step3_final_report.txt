  "purpose": "This code sets up a pytest environment, copies sample files, runs pytest with specific parameters, and parses an HTML report to verify test outcomes.",
  "sources": "Reading the report HTML file from a known location",
  "sinks": "Parsing the HTML report with BeautifulSoup; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks",
  "flows": "Read report file -> parse with BeautifulSoup -> find specific elements and verify counts",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest test script that performs environment setup, file copying, test execution, and report parsing. It uses standard libraries and no dynamic code execution or network activity. The report parsing relies on known report structure, with no evident security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's operations are safe, and the report's assessments are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest report parser with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
