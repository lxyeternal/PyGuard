{
  "purpose": "The code is a test script for running pytest tests, generating reports, and parsing HTML reports to verify test outcomes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, file system (reading report.html), and external files copied into the test directory.",
  "sinks": "Reading report.html file and parsing it with BeautifulSoup; potential data flow from external HTML report to internal variables.",
  "flows": "Arguments are passed to pytest via command-line; report file is read and parsed; data extracted from the HTML report for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The code performs standard testing operations and HTML parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pytest test that sets up a test environment, copies sample files, runs pytest with specific arguments, and parses an HTML report to verify certain test outcomes. No user input is processed directly, and no untrusted data flows into insecure sinks. The HTML report is read from a known report file generated by the test run. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Use of standard libraries (re, pytest, bs4) and typical file operations suggest normal functionality. No suspicious code patterns or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test script designed to run pytest, generate, and analyze HTML reports. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The code appears safe and does not perform any malicious actions.",
