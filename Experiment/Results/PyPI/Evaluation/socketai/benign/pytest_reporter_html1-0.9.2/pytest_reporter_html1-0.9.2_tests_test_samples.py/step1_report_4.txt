  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test script for running pytest-based tests, generating an HTML report, and parsing the report using BeautifulSoup to verify test outcomes.",
  "sources": "Reads test arguments, configuration files, and report files; accesses the filesystem to copy sample files; parses HTML report files.",
  "sinks": "Opens report HTML files for reading; processes the HTML content using BeautifulSoup; accesses file system to read sample report files.",
  "flows": "Test arguments -> running pytest -> generating report -> opening report file -> parsing with BeautifulSoup -> analyzing HTML structure and counts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code performs standard testing and report parsing functions. No hardcoded credentials or secret data present. No code injections or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard pytest-based testing setup, creating a test environment, copying sample files, running tests with specific parameters, then reading and parsing an HTML report to verify content. All operations are related to testing workflows and report analysis. There are no signs of malicious activity or suspicious code behaviors such as network communications, credential theft, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical testing utility for pytest reports with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs report generation and verification tasks securely and transparently.",
