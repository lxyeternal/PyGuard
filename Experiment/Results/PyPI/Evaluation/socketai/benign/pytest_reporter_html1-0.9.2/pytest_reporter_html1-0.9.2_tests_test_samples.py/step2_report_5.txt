  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the described logic, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a standard pytest test script that sets up a testing environment, copies sample files, runs pytest with specific arguments, and parses an HTML report to verify test outcomes.\n- The code uses common libraries (`re`, `pytest`, `BeautifulSoup`) and performs typical file I/O operations.\n- No reports mention any dynamic code execution, user input processing, network activity, or handling of secrets.\n- The malware score across all reports is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk score is low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the benign description.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears to be a straightforward test script with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- The HTML parsing and file operations are standard; no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.\n- No indication of code injection, external data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or security flaws are evident in the code or the reports.\n- The test asserts are simple and based on the HTML report structure, which seems correct.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are identified, increasing the malware or risk scores would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (or possibly 0, but given the reports, 0.1 is acceptable for minimal risk)\n\nThe code is a standard testing utility with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Maintain malware score at 0.\n- Keep obfuscated score at 0.\n- Keep risk score at 0 or 0.1.\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the provided reports.",
