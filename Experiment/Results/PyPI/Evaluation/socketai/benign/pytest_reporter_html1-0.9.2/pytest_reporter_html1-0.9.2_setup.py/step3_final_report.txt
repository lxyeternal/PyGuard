{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'pytest-reporter-html1' Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long description, imports 'os', 'codecs', and 'setuptools' for setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external interactions; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads file content, passes metadata and dependencies to 'setup()' function; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'setup.py' script following standard packaging practices. It reads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. All signals point to benign, well-formed configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The high confidence scores (1) are justified, and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the analysis.",
