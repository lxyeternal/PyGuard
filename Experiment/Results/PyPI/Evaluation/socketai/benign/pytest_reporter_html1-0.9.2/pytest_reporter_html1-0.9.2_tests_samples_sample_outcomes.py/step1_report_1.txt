{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of test functions and fixtures using pytest, primarily for testing and demonstrating different pytest features such as expected failures, skipped tests, and fixtures that raise exceptions.",
  "sources": "The code reads test definitions, fixture functions, and decorators; no external input or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process or output sensitive information or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "The test functions invoke pytest mechanisms internally; no data flow from sources to sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities is evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated sections, or suspicious constructs; the code uses standard pytest features without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script consists of standard pytest test cases with fixtures, markers for expected failures, skips, and a fixture that intentionally raises a RuntimeError. No input validation, data processing, or external interactions are present. The fixture raising an exception is a normal testing scenario to simulate failure conditions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite demonstrating various pytest features. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a typical example or test code with no security concerns.",
