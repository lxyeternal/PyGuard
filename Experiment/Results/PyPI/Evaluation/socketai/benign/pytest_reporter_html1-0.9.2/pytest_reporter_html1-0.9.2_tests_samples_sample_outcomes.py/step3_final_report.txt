{
  "purpose": "A simple pytest test suite demonstrating fixtures, assertions, expected failures, skips, and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from test functions, fixtures, and pytest markers; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks are present; the code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke fixtures and assertions; no external flows or data transmissions occur.",
  "anomalies": "The fixture 'broken' raises a RuntimeError intentionally, which is a standard testing pattern, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest test suite with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The fixture raising an exception is a controlled test scenario. No external data, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code uses standard pytest features without obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate benign, well-understood testing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest test suite with no security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
