{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of pytest test functions designed to validate code behavior, including passing, failing, expected failures, skipped tests, and a fixture that raises an exception.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input or untrusted data; it solely defines test functions and fixtures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could cause data leaks, system modifications, or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code is purely test logic without data handling or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The fixture 'broken' intentionally raises an exception to simulate failure; this is standard for testing error handling but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes pytest features such as fixtures, assertions, expected failures (@pytest.mark.xfail), and skipping tests (@pytest.mark.skip). There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The fixture raising RuntimeError is intended for testing error scenarios. The test functions perform basic assertions. No external data sources or sinks are used. The code appears to be standard testing code without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward pytest testing suite with no malicious behavior or security risks. All components are typical for testing scenarios, with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
