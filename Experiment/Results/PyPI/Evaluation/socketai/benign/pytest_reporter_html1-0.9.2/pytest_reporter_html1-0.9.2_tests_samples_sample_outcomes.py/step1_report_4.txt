{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to perform unit testing using pytest, including fixtures, test cases, and test markers for expected failures and skips.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from function parameters and internal variables; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write to external systems, files, or network resources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; test functions operate on static data and internal fixtures without external input.",
  "anomalies": "The fixture 'broken' intentionally raises an exception, which could be used to test error handling but does not appear malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present. Use of pytest markers is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes pytest testing framework features such as fixtures, assertions, and markers for expected failures and skipping tests. The 'broken' fixture raises a RuntimeError, which is typical in testing error handling, not malicious activity. The test cases perform simple assertions on static data. There are no external data sources, no suspicious code behaviors, and no signs of obfuscation or malware. The structure is standard for a test suite, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward pytest test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. It is used for testing and error handling demonstration, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
