  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward pytest test suite.\n- The fixture `broken` raises a RuntimeError intentionally, which is a common pattern for testing error handling.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are identified.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, indicating no security concerns.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is standard testing code demonstrating pytest features such as expected failures (`xfail`), skips, fixtures, and assertions.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The intentional exception in the fixture is a normal testing pattern, not malicious.\n- The reports' reasoning is consistent and well justified.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Obfuscated score: 0 in all reports — appropriate.\n- Malware score: 0 in all reports — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0 in all reports — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes are needed to the scores.\n- The code poses no security threat.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code is a benign, standard pytest test suite.\n- The use of `broken` fixture raising an exception is typical for testing error handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are correct, and the scores are appropriate given the code. No further action or concern is warranted.",
