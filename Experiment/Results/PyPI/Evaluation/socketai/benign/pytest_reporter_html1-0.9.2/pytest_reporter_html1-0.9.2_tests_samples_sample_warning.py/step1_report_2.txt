{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to issue warning messages using Python's warnings module.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing external; it only calls functions that generate warnings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code simply calls warning functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the warnings module and defines a function that emits two warnings: one user warning and one deprecation warning. The code does not read any input, connect to external resources, or perform any data processing. It appears to be a simple demonstration of issuing warnings without any malicious intent or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely issuing warnings for informational purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
