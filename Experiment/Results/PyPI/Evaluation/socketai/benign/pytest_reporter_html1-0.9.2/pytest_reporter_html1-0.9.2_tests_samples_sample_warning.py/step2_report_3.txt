  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, only issuing warnings via Python's warnings module.\n- No external inputs, data leaks, or network activity are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or signs of malicious behavior are detected.\n- All scores assigned are 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, with confidence at 1.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does exactly what the reports describe: defines a function that issues two warnings with static messages.\n- No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious constructs.\n- The warnings are standard and benign.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The code is very simple, and the reports are consistent in their benign assessment.\n- Since all reports agree and the code is trivial, there’s no indication of hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Score considerations:**\n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior is present.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- Risk score: 0 is appropriate; no security risk identified.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis. Given the simplicity, this is reasonable.\n- No assumptions about potential future misuse are necessary; the code itself is harmless.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The code remains benign and safe.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll evidence points to this being a benign, non-malicious snippet intended for issuing warnings, with no security concerns. The scores assigned are justified and should remain as-is.",
