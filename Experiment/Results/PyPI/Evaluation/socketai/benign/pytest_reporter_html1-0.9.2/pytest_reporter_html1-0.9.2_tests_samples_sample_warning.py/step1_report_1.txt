{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to issue two different warnings to the user: a user warning and a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data to external systems or write to files; warnings are printed to standard output or logged, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "There are no untrusted data flows or source-to-sink paths involving external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code only issues warnings; there are no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'warn' function from the 'warnings' module and defines a function 'test_warning' that, when called, issues two warnings: one user warning and one deprecation warning. The code is straightforward, with no external inputs, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior. It simply utilizes Python's standard warnings mechanism to alert users about certain conditions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs harmless warning notifications without any malicious intent or security risks. There are no signs of malware or suspicious activity.",
