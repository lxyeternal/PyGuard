{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function that issues warning messages to the user.",
  "sources": "The code reads input solely from its internal function calls and string literals; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The warnings are issued via the 'warn' function, which outputs messages to standard warning channels (e.g., console or logs). No untrusted data flows to insecure sinks.",
  "flows": "There are no external data sources; the flow involves static strings passed directly to the warning function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior detected. The code simply generates warnings with static messages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'warn' function from the 'warnings' module. It defines a function 'test_warning' that, when invoked, emits two warning messages: one of type UserWarning and another of type DeprecationWarning. There are no external data inputs, no malicious behaviors, no suspicious control flows, or obfuscated code. The warnings serve as informational messages, likely for deprecation notices or user alerts, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended to issue warning messages without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or harmful code, hardcoded secrets, or external data leaks. Overall, it appears benign.",
