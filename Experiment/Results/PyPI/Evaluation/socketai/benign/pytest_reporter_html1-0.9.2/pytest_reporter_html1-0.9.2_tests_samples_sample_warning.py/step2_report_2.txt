  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, issuing warnings via Python's warnings module.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or sinks that could process untrusted data are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or signs of malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code appears to be for demonstration or informational purposes only.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not read external data, connect to networks, or process user input.\n- Warnings are issued to standard warning channels; no data leaks or external system interactions are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The purpose is benign: issuing warnings for deprecation notices or user alerts.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Confidence is high (1), which is justified.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No issues are present in the code, and the reports are consistent.\n- The reasoning in the reports is sound; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the benign context.\n- The warning scores are not explicitly given but are implied to be 0, which is correct.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- Malware score should be 0.\n- Obfuscated score should be 0.\n- Risk score should be 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is harmless, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should reflect this, confirming no issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed no issues in the code.\n- Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n- The code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation.",
