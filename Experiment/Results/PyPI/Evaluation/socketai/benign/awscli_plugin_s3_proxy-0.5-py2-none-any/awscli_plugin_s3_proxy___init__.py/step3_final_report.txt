  "purpose": "Configure system proxy environment variables based on user profile data for AWS CLI commands.",
  "sources": "Profile data accessed via session.get_scoped_config() and parsed_args.command.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables (http_proxy, https_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY) set for network configuration.",
  "flows": "Profile data -> get_proxy_from_profile() -> set_proxy_from_profile() -> environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. Potential concern if profile data is malicious, but not an inherent flaw.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves proxy URLs from a profile based on a command, then sets environment variables accordingly. It performs a standard proxy configuration task without hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity. The malware score is 0, as no malicious actions are present. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is low (~0.2), acknowledging that if profile data is malicious or tampered with, it could redirect traffic maliciously, but this is a configuration trust issue rather than a code flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard proxy setup utility for AWS CLI. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low risk score is appropriate, primarily depending on the trustworthiness of profile data sources.",
