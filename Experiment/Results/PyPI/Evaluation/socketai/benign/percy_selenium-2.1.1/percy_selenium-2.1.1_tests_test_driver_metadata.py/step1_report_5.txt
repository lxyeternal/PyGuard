  "purpose": "Unit tests for the DriverMetaData class in the percy package, mocking Selenium WebDriver interactions.",
  "sources": "Mocked WebDriver attributes such as session_id, command_executor._url, capabilities, and desired_capabilities.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is being written to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Mocked WebDriver attributes are set up and used within assertions to verify metadata extraction; no external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code solely creates and uses mocks for testing purposes without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite using unittest and mock to test DriverMetaData class. It mocks WebDriver properties like session_id, URL, and capabilities. No user input, no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data hardcoding are present. The code strictly performs in-memory testing of expected behaviors without side effects or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign unit testing script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. It solely performs mock-based testing of metadata extraction functionality.",
