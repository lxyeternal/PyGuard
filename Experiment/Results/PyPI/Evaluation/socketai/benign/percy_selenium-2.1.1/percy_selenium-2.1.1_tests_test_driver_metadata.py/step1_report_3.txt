  "purpose": "Unit tests for the DriverMetaData class in the context of Selenium WebDriver, mocking WebDriver interactions.",
  "sources": "Mocked WebDriver object attributes such as session_id, command_executor._url, capabilities, and desired_capabilities.",
  "sinks": "Access to WebDriver attributes; no external data sinks, network, or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Test setup modifies mock WebDriver attributes; no data flows outside test environment or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Use of mock objects is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class that mocks Selenium WebDriver objects to test the DriverMetaData class. It patches external dependencies and sets attributes such as session ID, command executor URL, and capabilities. The tests verify that these attributes are correctly accessed via DriverMetaData. All data is mocked and confined within the test environment. No external inputs, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard unit testing code that uses mocks to simulate WebDriver behavior. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The code is safe and only serves testing purposes.",
