  "purpose": "Unit tests for the DriverMetaData class, verifying session ID, command executor URL, and capabilities extraction.",
  "sources": "Mocked selenium.webdriver.Remote object providing session_id, command_executor._url, capabilities, and desired_capabilities.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Mocked WebDriver object provides data to DriverMetaData instance; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials (besides benign test data), or unusual behaviors detected. The test data such as session IDs and URLs appear standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite utilizing mocking to simulate WebDriver behavior for testing the DriverMetaData class. No external inputs are processed at runtime outside of test setup. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious activities are present. The code does not execute untrusted code, perform obfuscated operations, or access sensitive data beyond test data. The test constructs are typical for testing class properties and do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test suite for verifying class properties with mocked data. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
