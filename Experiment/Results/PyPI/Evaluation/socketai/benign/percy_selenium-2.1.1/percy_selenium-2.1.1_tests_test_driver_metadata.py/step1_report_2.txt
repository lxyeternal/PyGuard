{
  "purpose": "Unit testing the DriverMetaData class for selenium WebDriver instances in the percy package.",
  "sources": "Mocked selenium.webdriver.Remote object, specifically session_id, command_executor._url, capabilities, and desired_capabilities attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified. The code only reads attributes from a mocked object.",
  "flows": "Data flows from mocked WebDriver attributes to assertions in tests; no untrusted data input or output flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets (beyond test data), or potentially malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a unit test environment for DriverMetaData, mocking WebDriver attributes and verifying attribute access. All data used are hardcoded within tests, with no external input or output affecting system state. No network or system manipulation code is present. The use of patches and mocks appears standard for testing purposes and not malicious. The code is straightforward, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test setup for the DriverMetaData class, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies solely on controlled mock data and testing patterns.",
