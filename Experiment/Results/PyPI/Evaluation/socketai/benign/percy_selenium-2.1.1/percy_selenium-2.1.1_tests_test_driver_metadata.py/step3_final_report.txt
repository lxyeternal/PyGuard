  "purpose": "Unit tests for the DriverMetaData class, verifying properties using mocked WebDriver data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded mock data within test setup (session ID, command URL, capabilities).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Mocked data assigned to WebDriver attributes; no external flows or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite that mocks WebDriver attributes to verify DriverMetaData properties. It uses standard testing practices with no external inputs, network calls, or malicious code. The data is hardcoded for testing purposes, and the code structure is clear and conventional. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The code does not handle sensitive data beyond test variables, nor does it perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. It is a standard, safe unit test suite verifying property access on mocked objects. The security risk score is 0, malware score is 0, and obfuscated score is 0, all consistent with the code's behavior.",
