  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Cache class in the percy.cache module, testing cache set, get, and cleanup functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'time', 'unittest', 'unittest.mock', and 'percy.cache'. Usage of 'patch' to mock methods and constants.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted input handling or data leakage points observed.",
  "flows": "Test methods invoke Cache class methods, with mocking applied for cache cleanup. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing on a Cache class, including setting, retrieving, and cleaning cache entries. It uses mocks and patches appropriately. No external data sources, user inputs, or suspicious code paths are present. The code is well-structured, with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of unit tests for cache management, with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious anomalies detected.",
