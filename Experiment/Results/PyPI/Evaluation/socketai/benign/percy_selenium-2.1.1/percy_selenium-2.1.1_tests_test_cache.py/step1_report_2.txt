{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Cache class in the percy.cache module, verifying cache set/get operations and cache cleanup functionality.",
  "sources": "Code reads static class attributes, method parameters, and uses patching to mock cache cleanup and timeout.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink that could lead to data leaks or code execution; standard test assertions and mock objects are used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test inputs (session_id, properties) through Cache methods, with validation and assertions verifying behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of unit tests for the Cache class, employing standard testing practices. It validates input argument types, correct cache storage, retrieval, and cleanup behavior. The use of mock patches to simulate cache cleanup and time delays is typical in testing. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code appears to serve its purpose without any suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit testing suite for cache functionality with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and uses common testing patterns. No malicious or suspicious code is identified.",
