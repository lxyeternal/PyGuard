  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Cache class, specifically testing cache setting, retrieval, and cleanup functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (time, unittest, patch) and the Cache class from percy.cache; reads data from self.cache, self.session_id, self.command_executor_url, self.capabilities.",
  "sinks": "Uses cache methods that modify or read CACHE; no untrusted external input or data flow from external sources.",
  "flows": "Test methods set cache data, retrieve cache data, and invoke cache cleanup; flows are internal to testing framework with no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials (other than example URL), or suspicious behaviors detected. The URL used is a placeholder, not malicious. No obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite for a cache management class. It validates input validation, cache setting, retrieval, and cleanup. No data leakage, malicious code, or suspicious activity observed. The only data manipulated are session IDs, URLs, and capabilities, all within a controlled test environment. No external data flows or potential attack vectors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate unit testing functions for cache management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal, safe testing script.",
