  "purpose": "Unit testing for the Cache class in the percy.cache module, focusing on cache set/get and cleanup functions.",
  "sources": "Input data is the session_id, properties, and cache data supplied to set_cache and get_cache methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities; test methods mainly perform assertions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test input parameters to cache methods; no external data or user input flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code appears to be standard test code with mock patches and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite for the Cache class. It sets up cache entries, verifies proper exception handling for invalid inputs, and tests cache cleanup. The use of mock patches and sleep to simulate cache expiration appears routine. No network communication, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated segments are present. The code's structure and functions are typical for testing cache behaviors, and there are no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious test suite for cache functionality. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. All observed behavior aligns with legitimate testing purposes.",
