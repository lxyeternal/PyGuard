  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for Percy visual testing commands, managing dependencies and driver validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from percy modules, driver class name checks, dynamic imports within functions.",
  "sinks": "External Percy functions invoked after validation; no untrusted data processed directly.",
  "flows": "Source imports and driver validation lead to calls to Percy SDK functions; fallback import handling for missing dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard dependency management and validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward wrapper functions with dependency checks and driver validation. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is evident. Dependency fallback mechanisms and class name checks are standard practices. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code's logic is clear, and the risk of malicious intent is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper for Percy testing functions, with proper dependency handling and driver validation. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.1 to reflect dependency management but minimal threat.",
