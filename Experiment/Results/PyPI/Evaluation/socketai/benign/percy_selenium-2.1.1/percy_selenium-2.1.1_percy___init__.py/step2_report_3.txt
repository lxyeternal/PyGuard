  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes wrapper functions, module imports, and driver checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data leakage; flow involves driver validation and external function calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies this as a standard wrapper with dependency handling, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct, no malware detected.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Risk: 0 — Correct; the code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes the wrapper functions and dependency imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leakage; external functions are called after validation.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; fallback import is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly notes that the code manages dependencies and driver validation, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — Slightly elevated but justifiable, as dependency issues could cause operational problems, but not security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the import flow and driver handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leakage; external calls are wrapped.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; dynamic import is standard for optional dependencies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes the benign nature, dependency management, and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Risk: 0 — Appropriate, as no security concern is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; wrapper functions with dependency checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leakage; external Percy functions are called after validation.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; dynamic import is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately describes the code as a benign utility with proper error handling.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Risk: 0 — Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; wrapper functions with dependency handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flow; external functions are invoked conditionally.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; fallback import is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as a safe, compatibility wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — Slightly elevated but justified for dependency issues that could cause operational disruptions, not security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0, with some slight elevations (0.1-0.2) for dependency management issues, which are not security risks but operational concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**1. Malware Score:**  \n- Should remain at 0 across all reports. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**2. Obfuscated Score:**  \n- Correctly 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n**3. Risk Score:**  \n- Slightly higher than 0 in some reports (up to 0.2), which is reasonable given dependency handling. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — minimal operational risk due to dependency issues, but not security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
