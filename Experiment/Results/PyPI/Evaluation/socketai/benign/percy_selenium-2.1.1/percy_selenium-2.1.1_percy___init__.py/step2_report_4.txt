  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided descriptions, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard wrapper for Percy snapshot and screenshot functions, with dependency management and driver type validation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The logic is straightforward, focusing on dependency handling and compatibility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dependency checks and driver validation, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious intent; the slight securityRisk score (0.2) reflects minimal concern over dependency handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a benign integration layer for Percy, with dynamic imports and exception handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Highlights the use of dynamic imports, driver validation, and exception handling, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No malware or malicious intent; standard utility wrapper.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern — wrapper functions with dependency checks, driver validation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a straightforward wrapper for Percy SDK functions, with dependency management and driver validation. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** The logic is sound; the only potential concern is reliance on driver class names and dynamic imports, but these are standard practices for optional dependencies and compatibility checks.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risks, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Malware risk justification:** Since the code only manages dependencies and wraps external functions without executing any untrusted code or transmitting data, malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about untrusted data processing or network activity. The code does not perform any data exfiltration or malicious operations.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns are present.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis assessment confirms the code is a benign, dependency-management wrapper for Percy visual testing tools, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and designed for compatibility.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior is evident.\n- The existing scores are appropriate; I would maintain or slightly lower the security risk to 0 for full consistency.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed analysis is needed.",
