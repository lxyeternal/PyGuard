{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrapper functions and imports for Percy snapshot and screenshot functionalities, mainly to facilitate web driver automation testing with Percy.",
  "sources": "Imports from percy.version, percy.snapshot, percy.exception, and conditional imports of percy_snapshot and percy_screenshot modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or transmit data, but calls external functions which could potentially handle untrusted data, especially the percy_screenshot function which interacts with web driver objects.",
  "flows": "Input is received through the driver parameter in percy_screenshot, which is checked for class type, then passed to external Percy functions. The flow involves validation of driver type, checking command executor class, and invoking external functions based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The code has conditional imports with fallback behavior, which is standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily acts as a wrapper around Percy SDK functions, with validation checks on driver types and conditional imports for optional dependencies. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or sensitive data handling internally. The fallback mechanisms and exception handling are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation are detected. The code is straightforward and appears to be designed for facilitating Percy visual testing integrations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wrapper module for Percy visual testing tools with proper validation and error handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It mainly manages dependencies and driver compatibility for Percy commands.",
