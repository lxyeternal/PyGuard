{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrapper functions for Percy snapshot and screenshot commands, enabling integration with web drivers and handling missing dependencies gracefully.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, driver class names, and command_executor class names to determine the type of web driver and to conditionally execute code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage or effect could occur if untrusted driver objects are manipulated, but the code itself does not process untrusted data directly. No direct sink identified.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking the driver type, then calling external Percy functions based on driver class names, with exception handling for missing modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code primarily handles dependencies and driver type checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Percy modules and wraps functions to provide compatibility and error handling. It verifies driver class types and connection types before invoking external Percy functions. Exception handling is used to manage missing dependencies. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be standard, dependency management, and compatibility wrapper code. No indications of code injection, data leakage, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard wrapper for Percy screenshot functionality, with dependency checks and driver type verification. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as expected for a compatibility layer, with no security risks identified.",
