  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard wrapper with dependency management and driver type verification, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Validity:** The code indeed performs dependency checks, wraps Percy functions, and verifies driver class names. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The report's assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dependency handling and driver validation, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — the securityRisk is slightly above zero, reflecting minimal concern about dependency handling.\n- **Validity:** The code’s fallback import and exception handling are standard. No malicious logic or obfuscation detected.\n- **Justification for risk=0.2:** Given that missing dependencies could cause failures, but do not introduce security vulnerabilities, a low risk score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a benign wrapper, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Validity:** The code’s dynamic imports and exception handling are standard, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, noting the dependency management and driver validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Validity:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Conclusion:** The report’s conclusion is valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms the code as a safe wrapper with dependency checks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Validity:** The code's structure and behavior do not suggest malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, dependency-aware wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (up to 0.2 or 0.1), justified by dependency handling and exception management, but no significant security risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and behavior, a risk score of around 0.1–0.2 is reasonable, mainly reflecting dependency management rather than security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard wrapper for Percy testing functions, with proper dependency handling and driver validation. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The current scores are appropriate, but I would suggest:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect dependency management but minimal security concern)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code’s behavior.",
