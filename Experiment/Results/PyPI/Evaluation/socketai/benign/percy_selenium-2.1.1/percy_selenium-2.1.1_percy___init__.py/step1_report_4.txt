{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrapper functions for Percy snapshot and screenshot commands, facilitating integration with web drivers like Selenium and Appium, and handling missing dependencies gracefully.",
  "sources": "Imports from percy modules; user input via driver parameter; dynamic import statements within functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential exception raising when dependencies are missing; calls to external Percy functions which could execute code, but only if dependencies are installed.",
  "flows": "Code imports Percy modules -> Wrapper functions receive driver input -> Checks driver type -> Calls appropriate Percy functions based on driver class name -> Handles ImportError exceptions gracefully.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import within functions for optional dependencies; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no suspicious external network connections or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages Percy snapshot and screenshot functionalities, wrapping existing Percy functions and adding dependency checks. It includes error handling for missing modules, ensuring graceful failure. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected. The import structure and control flow are straightforward, serving as utility wrappers. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, and no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard wrapper around Percy SDK functions with appropriate error handling for missing dependencies. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is a benign utility module designed for compatibility and robustness.",
