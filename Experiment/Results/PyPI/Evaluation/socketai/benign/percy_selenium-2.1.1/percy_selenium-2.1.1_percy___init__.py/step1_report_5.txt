  "purpose": "Provide wrapper functions for Percy screenshot and snapshot functionalities with compatibility handling and error messages.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional imports, and method parameters (browser, driver, name).",
  "sinks": "Function calls such as percy_snapshot, percy_automate_screenshot, percy_screenshot; raising exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input (browser/driver) flows into percySnapshot and percy_screenshot functions, then into respective Percy functions or error handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class name checks for driver types; fallback import with exception; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up wrapper functions around Percy testing tools, with conditional imports to handle optional dependencies. It validates driver types before calling external Percy functions, which are imported from trusted packages. Error handling is present for missing dependencies, instructing users to install required packages. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The code relies on standard Python practices, and there are no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a compatibility wrapper around Percy testing tools, with proper error handling and dependency checks. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
