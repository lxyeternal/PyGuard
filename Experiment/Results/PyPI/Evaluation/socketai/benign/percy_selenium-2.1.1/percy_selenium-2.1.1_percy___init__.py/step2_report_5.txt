  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It provides wrapper functions (`percySnapshot`, `percy_screenshot`) around Percy SDK functions.\n- It performs driver type checks based on class names.\n- It handles optional dependencies with try-except ImportError blocks, raising informative errors if dependencies are missing.\n- It uses dynamic imports within functions for optional modules.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code primarily manages dependencies and driver compatibility for Percy visual testing.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Wrapper functions, dependency handling.\n- Security assessment: No malicious behavior, standard code.\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Wrapper functions, dependency imports.\n- Security assessment: No suspicious behavior, standard exception handling.\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 (slightly above zero, but justified as minimal dependency management)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Integration with web drivers, dependency management.\n- Security assessment: No malicious activity, straightforward.\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Wrapper functions, dependency handling.\n- Security assessment: No malicious code, standard practices.\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- Confidence: 0.95\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility wrappers, error messages.\n- Security assessment: No suspicious activity, proper error handling.\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, related to dependency checks)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code?**  \n  The code appears to be standard wrapper functions with dependency checks and driver validation. No anomalies, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No significant errors are evident. The code handles missing dependencies gracefully and validates driver types.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware scores are all zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n  - Obfuscated scores are zero, matching the straightforward code.\n  - Security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal risk due to dependency handling and driver validation.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  Only Report 2 assigns a 0.2 security risk, justified by dependency management, which is standard practice. No other report indicates higher risk.\n\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  All zero, as expected. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge dependency management and driver validation as benign.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n  The scores align well with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard wrapper module for Percy visual testing tools.**  \nIt manages dependencies and driver validation with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, primarily due to dependency handling, which is standard)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is safe, legitimate, and does not pose security risks. The existing reports are accurate in their assessments. I would reinforce that the malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is minimal. The dependency management and driver validation are standard practices and do not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores with a slight adjustment to the overall security risk score to 0.1, reflecting the minimal dependency-related concerns, but overall, the code is secure and benign.",
