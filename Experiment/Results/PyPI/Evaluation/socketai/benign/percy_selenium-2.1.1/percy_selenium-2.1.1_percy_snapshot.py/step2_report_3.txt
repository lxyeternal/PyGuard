  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the logic, and the scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** The code facilitates DOM snapshots, environment info, and logging via requests, driver commands, and environment variables.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Requests are to localhost or Percy endpoints, which is standard.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states the code is a legitimate SDK component, with no signs of malicious behavior. Network requests are limited to Percy services, and no malicious code is detected.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, standard SDK activity)  \n\n**Verdict:** Valid, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar, involving environment variables, requests, driver.execute_script, and driver commands.  \n- **Anomalies:** Standard, no hardcoded secrets. The only note is dynamic script execution, which is typical for Selenium.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; network interactions are expected for SDK functions.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (appropriate for SDK operations)\n\n**Verdict:** Valid, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Same pattern—environment variables, requests, driver commands.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; standard use of environment variables and network requests.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; communication with Percy endpoints is expected.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Valid, legitimate SDK code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar, involving environment variables, requests, driver interactions.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; network requests are typical.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard for Percy SDK.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (even lower, indicating minimal risk)\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Same pattern—environment variables, requests, driver commands.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; network requests are expected.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malware or sabotage.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious payloads or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), appropriate for SDK code that interacts with external services and drivers but does not perform malicious actions.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The overall assessment is that this code is a legitimate, standard SDK component for Percy visual testing with Selenium.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The network interactions and code logic are consistent with expected SDK operations.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to account for external network requests and environment variable reliance, but these are standard and not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the reports' evaluations are accurate.",
