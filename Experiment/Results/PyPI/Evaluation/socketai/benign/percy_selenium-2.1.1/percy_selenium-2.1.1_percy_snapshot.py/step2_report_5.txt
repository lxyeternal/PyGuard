  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is legitimate, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. It notes standard SDK behavior, environment info collection, and network requests limited to localhost and Percy services.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate given the benign analysis. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing legitimate interactions with Percy APIs and Selenium, with no malicious behavior. The only point is the dynamic execution of scripts via `driver.execute_script`, which is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound. The network requests and driver interactions are typical for SDKs, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on legitimate functions, environment variables, and network requests. Highlights that no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk and malware scores are justified; the code's behavior is consistent with legitimate SDK operations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Continues the pattern of legitimate SDK functionality, with appropriate API interactions and DOM handling. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower risk score, which is reasonable given the absence of concerning behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, confirming the code is standard for Percy Selenium integration, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the previous assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No, the code matches typical Percy SDK patterns, with no malicious or suspicious code segments, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both are correctly scored as 0 across all reports. No signs of malicious code, encrypted payloads, or obfuscated logic.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero but low (0.1–0.2), reflecting standard network interactions and environment variable reliance, which are common in SDKs but could be exploited if environment variables are manipulated. However, no evidence of malicious exploitation exists.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports are consistent with each other and align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to external network requests and environment variable dependencies, but within acceptable bounds for an SDK of this nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for Percy visual testing with Selenium. No malicious, obfuscated, or backdoor behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe based on the provided analysis.",
