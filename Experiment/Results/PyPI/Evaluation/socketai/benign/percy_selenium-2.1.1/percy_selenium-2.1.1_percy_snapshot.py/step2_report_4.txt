  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scoring, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** The report correctly identifies the code's purpose—DOM snapshots, environment info, logging, and API interactions. Sources and sinks are consistent with the code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Network requests are limited to localhost and Percy services, which is expected. Error handling and logging are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is legitimate with no malicious behavior is well-supported. Confidence at 0.95 is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly notes interactions with environment variables, requests, and driver commands. Sinks include requests.post and execute_script.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard SDK behavior; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The dynamic script injection via `driver.execute_script` is common in Selenium automation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious intent. The confidence score of 0.9 is justified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. These are appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Accurately describes the functions and their data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Uses environment variables without validation, but this is typical. No malicious payloads or obfuscation. External API calls are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate SDK functionality, no malicious signs. Confidence of 0.9 is justified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct assessment. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly identified. The code interacts with environment variables, performs DOM snapshots, and communicates with Percy endpoints.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. External requests are appropriate. Reliance on environment variables is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears legitimate. Confidence 0.9 is justified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly identified. Interactions with environment variables, requests, and driver commands are well documented.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or backdoors. The code's network interactions are typical for SDKs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a standard Percy integration, no malicious activity. Confidence 0.9 is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, and the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting typical SDK operational risks but no significant vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, mainly due to external API communication and environment variable reliance, which is standard in SDKs.\n\n**My conclusion:** The code appears secure, legitimate, and well-structured for its purpose. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present, and the risk is low.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- The scores are reasonable and justified.  \n- No additional security concerns are identified beyond typical SDK considerations.",
