  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall security risk. I'll also verify if the report's conclusions and scores are justified based on the code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:** The code is a standard SDK for Percy visual testing with Selenium, with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct; code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — somewhat conservative, considering network interactions, but overall low.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard interactions, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — reasonable, given network requests and driver interactions.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:** Focuses on legitimate functionality, with no malicious behaviors. Notes the use of environment variables and external API calls.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — acceptable, considering external communications.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:** Highlights the standard nature of the code, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, appropriate for an SDK.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:** Also describes legitimate SDK behavior, with no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is consistent.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate. The code interacts with external APIs, but these are standard for SDKs and do not show malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify the code as clear.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly conservative but acceptable, given network interactions and environment variable usage.\n\n## Final Justification:\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n- External requests are limited to localhost and known Percy endpoints.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- Use of environment variables is typical and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, command injection, or malware.\n\n## Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for Percy visual testing with Selenium. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present, and the security risk is minimal.",
