  "purpose": "The code implements a Percy SDK component for Selenium-based visual testing, handling DOM serialization, environment info collection, and communication with Percy services for snapshots and screenshots.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PERCY_CLI_API, PERCY_LOGLEVEL, RESONSIVE_CAPTURE_SLEEP_TIME), API responses, driver.execute_script, driver.get_cookies, driver.get_window_size, driver.execute_cdp_cmd, driver.current_url, driver.capabilities, driver.session_id, driver.command_executor_url",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to Percy API endpoints, print statements for logging, driver commands for window resizing and DOM serialization",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence API endpoints and debug flags; driver interactions serialize DOM and capture screenshots; API responses determine flow control and error handling; logging occurs via requests and print statements",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation; use of environment variables and external API calls are standard; no unusual code patterns or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK for Percy visual testing with Selenium, performing DOM serialization, environment info collection, and communication with Percy services. It uses environment variables for configuration, interacts with web drivers for DOM and window management, and communicates over HTTP with Percy endpoints. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The network requests are limited to localhost and known Percy endpoints, and the code structure is clear and well-documented. Error handling and logging are standard. The use of driver.execute_script for DOM serialization and driver commands for window resizing are typical in Selenium automation. Overall, the code functions as intended for its purpose without any signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK component for Percy visual testing with Selenium. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical network interactions and environment variable usage without malicious intent.",
