      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with minor maintainability concerns due to private attribute access. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident. The reports are insufficient to justify higher risk or malware scores. Overall, the code is safe, and the risk and malware scores should be set to 0, with a very low risk score (~0.1) due to minor design considerations."

The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be adjusted to 0.1 to reflect minimal in-memory data exposure, but even this is very low. Overall, the code poses no supply chain security threat."

It does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical network interactions and environment variable usage without malicious intent."
