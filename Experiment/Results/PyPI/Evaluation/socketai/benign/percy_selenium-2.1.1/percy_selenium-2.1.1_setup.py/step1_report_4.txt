{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'percy-selenium' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long_description; imports 'percy' module for version info.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or used in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "Reads file content to assign to long_description; imports percy for versioning. No data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: importing modules, reading a README file, and calling setup() with package info. The 'percy' module is imported solely to access its version attribute. No data is fetched from external sources at runtime, nor are there any command executions, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. The code appears to be a typical setup.py for packaging and distribution without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup file with no signs of malicious code or supply chain attacks. It reads local files and uses known, safe dependencies.",
