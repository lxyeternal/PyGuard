{
  "purpose": "To configure the packaging and distribution of the 'percy-selenium' Python package, including reading the README and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, importing 'percy' module for version, and listing dependencies ('selenium' and 'requests')",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processed or executed in an insecure manner",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks detected",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads the README file for long description, imports the 'percy' module to access its version, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, external data injections, or malicious behaviors. All actions are typical for a setup script, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration script with no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
