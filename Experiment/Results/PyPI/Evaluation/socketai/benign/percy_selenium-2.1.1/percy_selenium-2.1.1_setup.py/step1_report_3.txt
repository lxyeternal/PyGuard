{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package 'percy-selenium', used to configure the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long description and imports the 'percy' package to access its version.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to untrusted data effect; the code primarily sets up package info without executing untrusted data or network operations.",
  "flows": "The version is obtained from the 'percy' package; reading 'README.md' provides long description data for setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading a file for long description, importing a package to get version info, and calling 'setup()' with static package data. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. All dependencies and metadata are conventional for Python packaging. No signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves to configure package distribution parameters safely and conventionally.",
