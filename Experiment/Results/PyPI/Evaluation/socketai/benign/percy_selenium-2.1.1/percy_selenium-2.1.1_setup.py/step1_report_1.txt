{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'percy-selenium' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; imports 'percy' module to access version information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially harmful operations or external effects.",
  "flows": "Reads external file for description; uses 'percy.__version__' to set package version; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, reading a markdown file, and invoking 'setup' with metadata and dependencies. The use of 'percy.__version__' assumes that the 'percy' module is safe and correctly implemented. There are no indications of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The dependencies are explicitly specified and seem appropriate for the package purpose. Overall, the code appears benign and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads a README file for documentation and uses the 'percy' module to set the version, which is a common practice. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
