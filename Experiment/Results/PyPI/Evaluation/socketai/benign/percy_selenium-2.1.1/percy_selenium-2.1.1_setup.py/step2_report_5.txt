  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence of malicious behavior?**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a standard setup script. It reads a README file, imports the 'percy' module to access its version, and calls `setup()` with static metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The code appears benign.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a typical setup script with no suspicious or malicious constructs. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. These scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0, which aligns with the benign assessment. No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   Since no malicious activity or code is present, malware scores of 0 are correct.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n   All reports base their conclusions on direct code inspection, with no assumptions about hidden behaviors. Their reasoning is sound.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**  \n- The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.  \n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Personal estimate (for completeness):**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the evidence, there is no indication of supply chain security issues here. The code is typical and safe for distribution.",
