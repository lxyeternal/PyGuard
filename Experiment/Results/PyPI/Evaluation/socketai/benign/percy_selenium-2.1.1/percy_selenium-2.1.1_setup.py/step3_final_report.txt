  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'percy-selenium' Python project, importing 'percy' to retrieve version info, and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file, imports 'percy' module for version, and static package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, dynamic code execution, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads local files and imports a module; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, benign setup script that reads a local README, imports 'percy' to get its version, and calls setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. Dependencies are explicitly specified. The import of 'percy' assumes the package is safe; if compromised, it could pose a supply chain risk, but this is outside the scope of this script. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
