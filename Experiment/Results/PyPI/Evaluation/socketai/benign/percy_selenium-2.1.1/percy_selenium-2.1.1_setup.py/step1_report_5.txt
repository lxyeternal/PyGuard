{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and other installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description; importing 'percy' module to access version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no code execution, network activity, or data leakage points are evident.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' into 'long_description'; retrieve 'percy.__version__' for versioning during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README file and imports a module ('percy') solely to access its version attribute. All dependencies and metadata are standard for a package setup. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code uses well-known libraries ('setuptools', 'os') and follows typical setup conventions. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely configures package metadata and dependencies.",
