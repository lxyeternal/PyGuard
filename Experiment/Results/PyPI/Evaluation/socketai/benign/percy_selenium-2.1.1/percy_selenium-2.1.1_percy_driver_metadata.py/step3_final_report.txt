  "purpose": "Provides a caching wrapper around driver session data, including session ID, command executor URL, and capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reads session_id from driver, accesses driver.command_executor._url, retrieves driver.capabilities.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes command executor URL and capabilities via cache; no direct sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Retrieves session_id -> fetches or sets cache for URL and capabilities -> accesses private attribute _url.",
  "anomalies": "Accesses private attribute '_url' of driver.command_executor; relies on external Cache class without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward cache wrapper for driver metadata. The main concern is the direct access to a private attribute '_url', which could break if internal implementation changes. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The cache usage appears standard but lacks invalidation logic. No evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities is found. The reports lack detailed data, so scores should be minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with minor maintainability concerns due to private attribute access. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident. The reports are insufficient to justify higher risk or malware scores. Overall, the code is safe, and the risk and malware scores should be set to 0, with a very low risk score (~0.1) due to minor design considerations.",
