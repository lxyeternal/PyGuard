{
  "purpose": "A simple in-memory cache system for storing session-specific properties with timeout-based cleanup.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method arguments 'session_id', 'property', and possibly the system time via time.time().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data leads to security issues; data is stored in a class variable cache and retrieved from it.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (session_id, property) are validated and stored or retrieved from the cache. The cache cleanup process reads timestamps and removes expired sessions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The cache cleanup is straightforward. No external dependencies are used that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward caching mechanism with expiration based on timestamps. It validates input types, updates cache entries, and removes expired sessions during cleanup. There are no indicators of malicious intent or suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The system does not handle sensitive data, and its operations are limited to in-memory data storage. The code is clean, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, simple caching utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as an in-memory cache with timeout-based cleanup, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
