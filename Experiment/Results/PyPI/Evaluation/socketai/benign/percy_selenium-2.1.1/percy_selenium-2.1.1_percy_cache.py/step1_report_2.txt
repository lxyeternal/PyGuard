  "purpose": "A simple cache mechanism to store and retrieve session-specific properties with timeout-based cleanup.",
  "sources": "Reads session_id and property arguments for cache access; reads current time for cleanup.",
  "sinks": "Returns cached values based on session_id and property; performs cache cleanup.",
  "flows": "Input (session_id, property) -> check_types -> get_cache -> return cached value; set_cache updates cache; cleanup_cache removes expired sessions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, and no unusual code constructs. Cache logic appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a class-based caching system with expiration based on timestamps. It validates input types, updates cache entries, retrieves values, and performs cleanup of expired sessions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident. The code does not contain any external network activity, credential theft, or obfuscation. It functions as a straightforward cache with timeout cleanup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign cache implementation without any malicious intent or security risks. It operates as a simple in-memory cache with expiration logic, and there are no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware.",
