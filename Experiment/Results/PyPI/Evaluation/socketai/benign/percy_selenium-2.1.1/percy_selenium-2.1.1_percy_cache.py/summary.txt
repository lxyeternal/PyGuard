  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cache utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be adjusted to 0.1 to reflect minimal in-memory data exposure, but even this is very low. Overall, the code poses no supply chain security threat."
