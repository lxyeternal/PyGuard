{
  "purpose": "A simple in-memory cache system for storing session-based properties with timeout-based cleanup.",
  "sources": "Reads session_id and property parameters for cache access and update; reads current time for cache cleanup.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to external system calls, network, or file operations. No untrusted data output or external data ingestion.",
  "flows": "Input session_id and property -> cache access and update -> cleanup based on timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The cache implementation appears straightforward. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class-based cache with timeout functionality. It includes type checks, setting and getting cache entries, and cleaning expired entries based on timestamps. The use of time and dictionary data structures is standard. No signs of malicious behavior or data leakage mechanisms. No suspicious external communications or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign cache implementation intended for session data management. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely within the application without external communication or data exfiltration.",
