{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple in-memory cache for session data with timeout-based cleanup.",
  "sources": "Reads data from method parameters (session_id, property), and time.time() for cache expiration.",
  "sinks": "Returns session properties; no data is written or transmitted outside the program.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to internal cache storage, with expiration logic based on timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Uses standard data structures and time functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward caching mechanism with timeout cleanup. It uses class methods to set and get cache entries, updating timestamps for expiration. No external network calls, obfuscated code, or malicious functions are present. The code appears to serve a benign purpose, managing cache entries with timeout logic. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cache implementation without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It handles session data securely within memory and does not perform any external or malicious operations.",
