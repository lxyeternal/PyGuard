  "purpose": "A simple in-memory cache with timeout-based cleanup for session data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'session_id' and 'property' for cache access and modification.",
  "sinks": "Retrieval of cached data via 'get_cache' method; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input validation flows into cache set/get operations; cache cleanup removes expired sessions based on timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with proper validation and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a benign, straightforward in-memory cache with session timeout cleanup. It validates input types, updates timestamps, and removes expired sessions. There are no external network calls, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The logic is correct and simple, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cache utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be adjusted to 0.1 to reflect minimal in-memory data exposure, but even this is very low. Overall, the code poses no supply chain security threat.",
