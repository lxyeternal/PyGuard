{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple in-memory cache system for storing session-related properties with timeout-based cleanup.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function arguments: session_id, property, and value. No external data sources are explicitly read in this code.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code only stores and retrieves data within an internal cache structure.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments into cache storage via set_cache; retrieval occurs via get_cache, with cleanup affecting the internal cache state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated or malicious-looking code, and no network communication or system modifications. The code strictly manages in-memory data without external effects.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward cache implementation using class-level dictionaries and time-based expiration. All methods perform standard data validation and cache management. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks. It does not process untrusted external input beyond function parameters, nor does it perform unsafe operations such as executing code or network activity. The use of time for cache expiration is typical and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard in-memory cache implementation without malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
