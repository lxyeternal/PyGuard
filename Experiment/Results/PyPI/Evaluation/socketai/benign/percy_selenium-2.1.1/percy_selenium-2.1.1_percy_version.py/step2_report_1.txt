  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string (`'2.1.1'`) to the variable `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic. This is a common pattern in Python packages for versioning metadata.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**  \nNone of the reports indicate any suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and minimal, with no obfuscation, no external dependencies, no code execution, and no data flows.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: the code is benign, standard, and free of security issues. There are no logical flaws or errors identified.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Justification**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**  \nThe reports assume that a simple version assignment cannot be malicious, which is valid. There are no claims of hidden behavior or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate**  \nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments. The code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the reports are accurate and the scoring is appropriate.",
