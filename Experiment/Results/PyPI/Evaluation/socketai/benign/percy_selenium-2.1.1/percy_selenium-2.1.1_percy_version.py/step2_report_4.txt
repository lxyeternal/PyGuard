  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: assigning a version string ('2.1.1') to the `__version__` variable.\n- No input/output, external calls, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present.\n- The code is a standard practice in Python packages for version declaration.\n\n**Issue Presence:**\n- The code snippet is straightforward and does not contain any hidden or malicious behavior. The reports correctly identify this.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- No significant errors are apparent. The analyses are consistent and accurate.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- The conclusions are reasonable: the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Scores Review:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is correct.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- The reports do not assign any suspicious or malicious attributes.\n\n**Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious activity or security issues. The code is merely a version string assignment.\n- Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- Correctly 0 in all reports; no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n- No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n- The reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0  \n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely declarative, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- No obfuscation or hidden logic.\n- The version assignment is a standard practice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- All scores are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0).",
