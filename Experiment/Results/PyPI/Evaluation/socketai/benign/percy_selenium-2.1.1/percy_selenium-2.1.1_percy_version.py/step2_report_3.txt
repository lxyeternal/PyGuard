  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports describe the code as simply assigning a version string to `__version__`. The original code snippet confirms this: `__version__ = '2.1.1'`. There are no other operations, no input/output, no external calls, no dynamic code, and no obfuscation.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their description. They correctly identify the code as benign, standard practice, and free of suspicious behavior.  \n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.  \n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   - Since the code is straightforward, with no external interactions or suspicious patterns, risk scores higher than 0.0 are unwarranted.  \n   - The reports' scores are consistent with this assessment.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this score is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - All claims are based on direct analysis of the code snippet, with no assumptions about hidden behaviors.  \n   - The reports correctly avoid speculative claims.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Final Step — My Overall Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correctly reflects no malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a standard version assignment in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \n- The original code is safe and standard.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.  \n- No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0",
