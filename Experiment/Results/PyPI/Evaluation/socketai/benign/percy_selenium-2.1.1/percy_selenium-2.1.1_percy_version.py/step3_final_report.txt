  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for package metadata.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "None; straightforward assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The scores across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
