{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for the Percy SDK, involving mock servers, HTTP requests, and WebDriver interactions within a controlled environment, with no malicious activity detected.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests to localhost endpoints, WebDriver interactions, reading cookies and driver capabilities, input parameters for snapshot functions.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to local Percy server endpoints, data written to network sockets during mock server interactions, driver method calls.",
  "flows": "Sources include WebDriver and input parameters; flows lead to HTTP requests to local mock endpoints for snapshots, logs, and health checks; no external data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Code is straightforward and test-focused.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests with extensive mocking, confined to localhost and mock servers. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The data flows are limited to controlled test environments, and no external network activity or sensitive data handling is present. The structure and purpose align with standard testing practices, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing suite for Percy SDK, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
