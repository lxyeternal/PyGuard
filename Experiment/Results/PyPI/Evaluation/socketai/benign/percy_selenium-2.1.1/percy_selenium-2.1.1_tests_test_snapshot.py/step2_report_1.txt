  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive test suite for Percy SDK, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code interacts only with mock servers and local WebDriver instances, with no signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate given the controlled environment.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on testing Percy SDK with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code only interacts with local mock servers and WebDriver mocks. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the Percy SDK's interaction with Selenium WebDriver, no malicious activity observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll interactions are within a testing context, limited to localhost and mock responses. No signs of malicious code or backdoors.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a testing suite for Percy SDK, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is standard testing code, with interactions confined to mock servers and local WebDriver instances.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing that the code is for testing with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.05\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe very low risk score aligns with the code's nature—strictly testing, no external threats.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the clean, test-only code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation, but all are very low, reflecting the safe, controlled testing environment.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 to 0.1 (consistent with current scores)\n\n**Note:** The code is purely a test suite with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores are justified and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports accurately assess the code's security posture. No modifications needed. The code remains a safe, standard testing suite for the Percy SDK.",
